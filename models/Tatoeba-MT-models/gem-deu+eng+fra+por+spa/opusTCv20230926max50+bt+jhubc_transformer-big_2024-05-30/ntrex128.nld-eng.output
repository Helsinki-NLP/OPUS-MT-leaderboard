Members of the National Assembly of Wales worried that they will be “compared to Muppets”
There is a stir among the Members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly‘ to ‘Welsh Parliament‘.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name seems ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party's National Assembly of Wales said that MWP "rides on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the Plaid Party's National Assembly of Wales said the group as a whole is "dissatisfied" and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party is "open" to the name change, but noted that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: “Of course, it is the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the members of the National Assembly of Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
Currently, the members of the National Assembly are proposing alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have a hard time reaching consensus, and she will have to submit a bill on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The legislation on the reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country’s name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country’s name to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a lengthy dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to applications from Macedonia to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, has said that he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin are silent, the bells of Harlem are struggling
“The elderly people I talked to said that there used to be a café and a church on every corner here,” Adams said.
Today, there is neither a café nor a church to be seen here.”
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
“People now have social contact in a different way,” he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the neighborhood’s living room, where people regularly visit.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the churches’ assets will last less time than the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.”
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that won’t help in the neighborhood’s remaining havens.
“The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers at 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July referred to the instrument in a different way: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carillon in the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the church's lay leaders, others by the diocese.
The consistorium (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would "report the costs" to the consistorium, although the consistorium had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese had sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old who dived to lobsters in California
On Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy diving to lobster in California. The boy sustained injuries, it reads.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with a few others, he paddled towards the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was screaming because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized “the boy was screaming, ‘I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His collarbone was completely open," Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
“I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger of death.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured to the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break into the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and sets up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in grocery stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household items continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If they prove successful, they will be introduced in even more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a consequence of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood with other products.
Sainsbury’s wants to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gets more space, with showroom space per brand, such as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique make-up, with most products being vegan-friendly, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery will test the Fragrance Shop concessions in two stores of Sainsbury’s. The first opened in Croydon, south London, and the second will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets on a daily basis, supermarkets need to make more efforts to convince people to shop from them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s Chief Executive, says the stores will look more and more like supermarkets, as the supermarket chain faces off against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury’s has integrated Argos outlets into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were acquired two years ago. According to the company, food sales have increased as a result and the acquisitions have yielded more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its Beauty and Pharmacy departments a makeover, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended when a conflict arose over the distribution of pharmacy revenues in supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments in stores sold three years ago for an amount of <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We’ve completely changed the layout of our beauty department to make it more enjoyable for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby resigns from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, is 'furious' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has pulled out of an 11 million-pound deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand of homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is sometimes compared to the brand Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious with Holly Willoughby because she has pulled out of their profitable lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “furious” when Willoughby announced Tuesday, during a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts (valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) did not leave enough time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand.
The company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and is expected to double Willoughby’s fortune of an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his vacation rentals abroad.
A source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future, and yield enough for the next decades.
Everyone was surprised when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, as the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse at the headquarters in Marlow is packed with products ready for sale.”
Experts believe the presenter’s departure, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to large investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now face further delays.
This could be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, became Chairman of the company in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S’s brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I’m A Celebrity on ITV.
A source from Jones’s entourage said last night, “We have no comment on his business affairs.”
Hard language ‘and then there was love between us’
He joked about the criticisms he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find “inappropriate for a president” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea sees no “corresponding response” by the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament initiatives.
Meanwhile, the United States is continuing its sanctions to keep pressure on the boiler, he said.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
“We’re doing very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results. The rocket tests have ended, hostages have been freed and the physical remains of U.S. military personnel have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach regarding his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the public in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer had a home, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
“In many cases, it is unfortunately clear that they are not seeking international aid, which is difficult for us,” said Ms Sumbung.
Save the Children is in the process of setting up a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain if the relief workers from abroad can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Aid Agency, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide from tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
That there was no warning siren for tsunamis present in Palu, even though a warning was in effect, has probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal conditions, it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship moored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia’s wasteless infrastructure was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko is facing a shortage of funding, and that while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority now follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting in the streets, with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge wins impressive match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was 1-0 behind.
He tapped left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, in the direction of the top right corner of the net.
He avoided the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and dared to try. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked the ball.’
Chelsea came 1-0 at rest, after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues' lead kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the midfield to Liverpool's playing half.
Kovacic did a quick one-two in midfield.
Then he gave a nice pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were stuck in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed as a result of last Friday’s 7.5-strong earthquake, which also caused waves of 6 m high, said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7.55 p.m. The body was stabbed and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has only just begun, but I want to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they may have filmed something via a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A police officer would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying at the scene.
She keeps repeating, ‘How bad!’
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the barracks and a third was just outside.
Within the barracks, a number of police officers watched the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, to call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, stating log 247 of September 30.
Cromwell statue at British Parliament is latest victim of 'rewriting history' riot
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justification for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate about the removal of statues would lead to the visting of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many still believe should be recognized today.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely correct presentation is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gulf.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and commemorated.”
Suicidal pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, whose only surname is known, Yuan, was found dead at a stall at the marketplace in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, his artery was pierced and he was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig stable, on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his nephew found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pig stable open.
According to the nephew, there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth in the pighouse.
A forensic study found that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My nephew’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” said the nephew with the surname ‘Wu’, according to Guiyang Evening News.
Video footage from surveillance cameras shows that Yuan arrived at the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not from Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba testified at CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
“They’re just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they're not looking to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's tail brings heavy rain to southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it reaches the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and southwest in the coming days.
At 135 km/h on Sunday morning at 5 a.m. local time, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris streams and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rain is expected to reach 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as the tropical rain can fall very scattered.
It is strongly advised not to go into the desert on foot when the tropical rains threaten.
Heavy rains can turn ravines into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the southern California coastline.
There is 1.5 cm of rain possible, which could lead to small debris streams and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rain will be more scattered Monday at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, temperatures in the U.S. may fluctuate sharply as the North Pole gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the sustained summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and east of the US, October is expected to start warm, with temperatures fluctuating around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States is high until mid-October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on one of six television networks the poignant testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault reportedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, while broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday’s surprise: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in an animated testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have probably watched on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for the other networks broadcasting the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in an office.
For comparison, that’s about like a play-off of a football game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the most viewers on the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the audience remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of Friday’s events.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his vote, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded that protesters screamed at him as he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while being insulted, live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had made a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more at the hearing.
The various channels broadcast everything live when the judiciary committee had to vote on Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate hours later.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour provided that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by the next week, something that the minority Democrats are urging.
Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of “a political game” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s duties was ‘absurd’.
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of homicide, Baton Rouge police said.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, CBS television station WAFB reports.
The police questioned Simpson and later stated that he had confessed that he had shot Wayde with the result of death.
His security deposit has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The forensic surgeon in East Baton Rouge on Friday published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The report states that the Louisiana State Police’s Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for his “dedication and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "in shock" by Waydes' death.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ashes on Mexico City
The ash spit out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater was picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected rumblings and vibrations several times.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash on car windows in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco, appeared.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, for the first time since September 2017, when a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico on the Richter scale.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists hit the riot police, while thousands took part in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that split the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists stopped by the riot police shelled the agents with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, skirmishes broke out with the police, and the cops pulled their club upstairs to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups chanted: ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive’, while their opponents shouted ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they sustained during the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions continue to rise in the independence-minded region, a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters spoke out overwhelmingly to become independent, although the turnout was low and the people who are against resignation boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the region’s polling stations, resulting in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot the night of Friday on Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s prospects of becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was scarce, it was difficult for them this year to build on their success. Many of their most famous leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in prison pending a lawsuit over their role in organizing the referendum and the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are getting higher and higher,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional detention since the end of last year, declared that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after house was hit with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was hit repeatedly in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at around 7:30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
At some point, a crossbow may have been fired at the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and earned Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he is manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to be on par with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed to win an away game during the Premiership this season, having to face Leader Hearts on Sunday, who has eight points ahead of them.
But first, the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has won six games in a row in his division, and coach Holt has not suffered a single defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
The team of Holt had been able to make a head start long before the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's header, kicked the ball above the goal.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances calmly and confidently.
And that ultimately led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
At the time, the Rangers had had possession of the ball for a long time, but the defense of the home team was inflexible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a forward from his colleagues at Livingston.
Livingston's penalty area was consistently reached by forwards, but they were denied a penalty every time. Twice a penalty was refused, one after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has hardly changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has swept the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the top of their toes throughout the game.
However, the Rangers were unable to break through.
Even though they have played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final stage was not good enough (they only managed to eliminate the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better because they are somewhere in the middle of the rankings.
Erdogan is welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a shining blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police called on security reasons when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also voiced their views, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford kills cyclist after car crash
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an escape crime accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said police officers were busy identifying the man and will inform his immediate family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Wounded in Order Disruption
Six guards have been injured in a disruption to the order in a highly secure men's prison, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out Sunday at around 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still going on.
Specialized Tornado guards have been deployed to solve a situation involving eight prisoners in one department.
The guards were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars for longer."
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to jail for a serious order disturbance that attacked staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with potentially positive effects on drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what is likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert area, which entails risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for Monday and Tuesday for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to be hanging just above Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there are 10 cm possible.
For those areas that are not at risk of flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently undergoing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map denoting current drought areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com reported.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, attenuating them.
Therefore, she is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday in the afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
Heavy rain can fall in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"Precipitation of a total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north across Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then embark on Tuesday evening through Arizona and southern Utah.
“The biggest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and debris streams in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured Saturday at about 4 a.m. local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police ask anyone who may have filmed something of what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suffered from the vileness, the anger” of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has consistently “suffered from the vileness, the anger” of the Democratic Party during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and vigorously and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw “the magnificent and incredible character, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to acknowledge one of the most accomplished legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent track record,” he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
“I’m not taking part, but I’m actually taking part,” he said.
“That’s why I stand up for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and obstruct us.”
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a top GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is rising
A major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed at least 384 people, many of whom were wiped off the ground when giant waves crashed onto the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters high hit the land at the time it started twilight. Many people collapsed and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not immediately walk away and became victims of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Natural Disaster Aid Bureau, BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other hazards: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Natural Disaster Aid Agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been twisted and collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town continued to tremble by aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the dead were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, with some 540 people injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala “is completely flat, we don’t have any information at all,” Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday for not saying a tsunami had hit Palu, although staff said the waves had reached the country by the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building is screaming at people down the street in panic to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water plunges onto the shore and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters was unable to verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military is currently sending cargo planes carrying relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport is only reopened for relief and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very, very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely arrived in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their offices seek shelter in tarpaulin tents, but passed through scenes of devastation along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very, very bad.
Even when relief groups began the difficult task of launching emergency relief, some complained that certain foreign aid workers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can only be admitted if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing continued to hope that they would find their loved ones’ lives back, as in the miracles that people love to hear about terrible natural disasters like this one.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place in Indonesia earlier this month.
His students were also imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a paragliding veteran, I carry my own emotional load,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread to the paragliding community and that in the hours afterwards he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, only one gray check mark appeared in his messages instead of two blue check marks.
“I think that means the messages haven’t been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while supplying ATM in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver had just emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, according to Inspector Dennis McCarthy.
While he was busy, another man walked behind Brink’s employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is requested to contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: "The creature formally known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Ye is not just an abbreviation of his current artist name; West previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, when he told radio presenter Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
I’ve switched from Kanye, which means ‘the only’, to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also worked with and without the hyphen and capitals.
Mexican president vows not to use armed forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has pledged to never use military power against civilians. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing up to 300 people, during which time left-wing student movements emerged throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said young people often join criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
The U.S. needs to double funding for AI
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount it spends on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I..
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be the number one in the field of AI innovations by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for research on A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the likelihood of the next major achievement for A.I. taking place in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” this month was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese department.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, as it would help discover the following visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"China doesn't pick up our best academics, the companies do," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best forces from universities to work on A.I.
Lee said U.S. efforts in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Anyone who pursues a doctorate in A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences is giving financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are giving money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center designed to involve industry and academic partners in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the U.S. legislation that should lead to the establishment of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been in the slums for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change of country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country’s name to ‘North Macedonia Republic’, which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been ongoing for decades and would no longer impede Macedonia’s application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country claims Greek territory. Consequently, Greece vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia into the European Union and NATO.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign is not certain that the required turnout of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is formulated as follows: ‘Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
“Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the price to be paid is worth trying to join bodies like the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia broke up.
“I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgiyevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
At the time, however, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters came to vote.
“I’m coming to vote because it’s important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will generate much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the vast majority are in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said that a ‘yes’ as a result would be ‘a confirmation of our future’.
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote in favour.
If the referendum is to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes Brighton's full defense and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling faced Brighton's defense at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the match 2-0.
It seemed like a whistle of a penny, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker first got the ball played on the midfield.
He raced through between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was also too fast for a few others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English striker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he stood deep in the playing field of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player tapped the ball into the net just before it was too far.
The match will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, at 12.55 a.m. on Tuesday against Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League.
Scherzer wants to play along and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there was not much reason to force a new start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are consequences for the Rockies' participation in the play-off. They are currently one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have earned at least a wildcard for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but want to do everything in their power to secure their first division title.
“Although there is nothing left for us, at least we can pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play with that?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to pitch Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the throw-in field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington’s right-handed thrower is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part. That's why I stand up for great candidates everywhere," he said.
“We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they are determined to take power back, no matter what they have to do for it. You see the meanness, the awkwardness.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that.'
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and obstruct us.”
“And we’ve seen that over the past four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and false and lying.”
He named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to loud shouts from the public.
“Do you remember what she answered?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum’s activists voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I am the newest in a whole series of Labour MPs who were told that we are not welcome simply because we say what we think.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And that was the case during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am already a local Labour MP.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a ‘kinder, softer’ policy has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a disagreement is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues who, as far as I know, had a similar political outlook to me, suddenly expected me to make a reversal and take a position that I would otherwise never have agreed to, from topics such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak in front of an audience, whatever I say, there are insults on social media calling for the rejection of my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election, denounced the politics of the centre and told me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that serious abusive speech is apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of distrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes petty.
For the past two years, I have often been advised to keep myself low, not just to express my opinion loudly, and then I would ‘not get in trouble’.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined Labour as a school child 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated for better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a city councillor and in my role as a minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my disputes with current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves forward to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually, I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting in accordance with what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr on the way to the top
Two late try's may have slightly skewed the end result, but there's no doubt Ayr is rightly triumphing in this delightful match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the rankings, the only undefeated team out of the ten.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that gave the home team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was satisfied.
"We've had a hard time so far in our games and we're still unbeaten, so I'm a lucky man," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie: 'Honor to Ayr, they've seized their chances better than us.'
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Clima, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors' match), Melrose was able to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot managed to break off a try.
With a penalty, Clima gave Ayr an extra lead and scored a conversion after a solo try just before the rest. It was 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The game lay still for a long time before a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off on a stretcher, and once the game was restarted, Ayr was able to finish off by a try from Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Clima.
Then captain Blair Macpherson of Ayr got a yellow card, and again Melrose settled with the extra man when no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a match where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Clima without the ball, MacPherson made a touchdown on the penalty line-out behind the advancing Ayr mouth.
Clima took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart again, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going into the catering industry. Apparently he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts alongside his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the ‘blooming restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia’s landlocked country hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Seamen patrolling a rigging-clad naval office in La Paz.
A blue flag is waving at public buildings.
On all naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours.
It’s a duty to win them back.”
Throughout country-surrounded Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country had to surrender to Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century commodity conflict is still alive, as is the desire to navigate the Pacific again.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the ruling of the Court on large screens, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will advocate in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of spicy talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial fight for re-election next year, there is a lot at stake with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the authority to grant Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ruling of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final hearing indicates that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the prospects of a positive result from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation may have even worsened in the past four years.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,” Zárate said.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has all the good will that Chile might have completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to continue to talk afterwards.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in their respective countries since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, is using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never remove its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart the stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "utopia" that the lasting sanctions and US objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will one day bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the field of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and doubt that Pyongyang is serious when he says he would renounce an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Unveil the Latest Collection of Huge Headwear, Soon For Sale Near You
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun out of your eyes, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized headwear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were inconceivable from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their dazzling creations to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a feather-like wide border, which hung up over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons set with gemstones, a wizarding hat, and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were stitched, resembling Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving gear, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another resembled a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're in luck.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the scattered hat with a two meter wide border that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also created another big creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in a swimsuit that the bag sailed along.
The red-orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra-large accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills Essential for World Citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent track record in the field of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with yet another series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community-wide initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects by excellence within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and a relationship of trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can infer that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS, shows that 72 percent of the students achieved a high score (“A”) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students achieved German, 69 percent of the students French and 63 percent of the students Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now as much appreciated as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the British Commission on Employment and Skills found that of the obstacles to filling vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, in the future he will have a real advantage with such a lifelong skill.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language that stood above 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today’s children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those of emerging economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot currently be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vital to the country’s future, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I'm fine with the fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans waiting for the first game of LeBron James at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game ahead of the season.
It remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six games ahead of the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need any races before the season to prepare,” he said.
Trump's election rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a long series of election rallies
It is Trump’s first of five planned rallies in the coming week, including stops in places he is inclined to include Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the nomination of the candidate he elects for the Supreme Court vacancy has been put on hold, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time does Trump’s rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via the livestream on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about this week’s Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh hearings, which were extra charged as Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment as the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans running for the November election get more elan.
President Trump’s campaign leadership said these five rallies next week are meant to “stimulate volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of Congress is so important to his program that the president travels to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday marks the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing of odds is a completely invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So who gets the best chances right now?
“They had a lead of six points at first, and now that’s only four more, so we’re pretty much thinking luck is on our side right now,” Spieth said before leaving at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of being four points ahead, while there are twelve more at stake.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been a fearsome opponent from tee to green and he sets the example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial pit with which match four became a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His pit with which they won the match at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do now.
18 holes to make your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but delicious European duo has four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that didn't play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey's on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to make a European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson faced Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a lag for the Spaniard and the Swede that they could no longer overcome.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
The European team has already played the best so far and has a nice lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to take on the fight, something some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After Saturday’s four-balls and foursomes, they are 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The spirited duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two wins more than Tiger Woods, who was struggling, giving them a four-point lead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wants the trophy she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but was unable to catch up.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points during Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed ‘Molliwood’, are only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening games after a sensational weekend.
After catching Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully matched and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the morning four-balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world, with 2&1.
Nevertheless, it did not run from a slate roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the norm for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a difficult game with 2&1 from Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up to four points at the start of the singles, although the Furyk team has enough to tie, as they currently hold the trophy.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it will “in no case” unilaterally disarm without trust
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions lead to increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could under no circumstances unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the site for nuclear testing, and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"We do not see a similar response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will under no circumstances unilaterally disarm ourselves."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, whereby North Korea would be rewarded as it takes further steps, it was noted that he did not disapprove of unilateral denuclearization a priori, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea aims to formally end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to relax international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. is urging ‘denuclearization first’ and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions only reinforce our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the US leader suggested to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: “If the other party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the American mainland would be aimed so after “Mr Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim this year at the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions must continue until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the United Nations Security Council: “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must be vigorously and firmly continued until we have realized the full, definitive, verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea to severely reduce funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he wanted were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Course on the Importance of Sufficient Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will ensure that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night while drinking a lot of caffeine.
One professor noted that the students of the world’s largest university often have no idea of the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he knows is unique in the US.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing this now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which will be organized for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was determined that students had severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, students see a picture of a dorm room, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Using a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we find that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what effects the choice of cigarettes has on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride on a night’s study continues to exist, he says, and due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is an ever-increasing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, of good quality, must be the student’s ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler set up the course because he had taken lessons with the professor last year when he was studying at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before coming to the competitive setting.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, not just an alarm to get up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, causing you to have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal brings down Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their away game again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team hoped for a first win in an away game since defeating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team lost, barely Gerrard's second as a manager in 18 games. His team is now eight points behind Hearts, which continues to finish at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get into even more trouble, as frontier judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently an object was thrown at him by the supporters of the visitor team.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, passing Ayr and heading to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same team for Livingston, who scored a point for the Hearts last week. He would have been delighted with the way his well-trained team managed to block off the opponents at every move.
The Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga dropped the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had Allan McGregor's goal in sight, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the rear pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to be hoping for a good outcome rather than really believing in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos thought he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless clashed after fifteen minutes of playing, but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's request.
The Rangers could only shoot to the goal twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was a former goalkeeper at the Ibrox, could easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Livingston's opener in the 34th minute may not be in line with the overall gameplay, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs’ deep playing pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who kicked the ball into the goal with ease.
Gerrard made a break with the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent switch, which had almost immediate consequences when the wing player passed Morelos, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston likes to play, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final stage of the match, but McGregor held up well and blocked off Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
At the end of the game, Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton asked for a penalty kick after an encounter with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning’: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom can count well... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has since become an icon in pop culture, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film featuring the unlikely at first sight cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?'
Rogers: ‘That’s a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: ‘It’s really booming now!’
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells in a patient to modify them in a lab
They can then ‘see’ a protein that is common in many types of cancer and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine gives promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells from a patient, then adjusts the cells in the lab so that they can ‘see' the protein HER2, which is common in all types of cancer, and then injects the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer', including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and “teach” these cells to tackle cancer cells has been shown to work in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West dismisses pro-Trump tyranny and wears MAGA cap after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
It didn’t go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was chanted during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he will be presidential candidate in 2020.
After delivering his third issue of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the lyrics Make America Great Again, he ran a tirade against the Democrats and reiterated that he supports Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you sympathize with Trump? He’s a racist!’
“If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stabbed the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Justice Committee in connection with the alleged assault of which Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
West's tirade was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it on social media.
It's not clear whether Rock wants to sting the dragon with West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his cap.
“They’ve harassed me backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t step on the stage with that cap.’
They harassed me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathetic it looks?’ He said that he would wear her superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
According to Variety, the audience heard at least two bow calls and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed. The magazine was told by one of the attendees: ‘The whole studio was suddenly silent.’
West was the last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR DEFITING THE MASSA.”
But talk show presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just “just herself, and that’s beautiful.”
“But I choose not to reward someone who supports and spews out an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He is free to do whatever he wants.
“We too,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, he is “the creature formally known as Kanye West”.
He is not the first artist to change his name; he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg also bore the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then to The artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the police judge in Belfast on Monday.
The accusation will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington reveals toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor draws on the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that when young boys see such roles on the screen, they often think they have to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thinks “something has gone wrong” and asked himself how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who is recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he strongly believes the problem needs to be addressed.
“This is really an important question for me personally at the moment: where has our masculinity gone wrong?” he said.
"What have we learned men as they grew up, causing us to face this problem now?"
Kit thinks television might be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, due to his very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is learned?”
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys think they should be a certain type of man?
I think that is one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
“There’s something wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not appear in prequels or sequels to Games of Thrones when the series ends next summer, because he is “ready with battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit plays in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he believes that his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful consequence of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife during the show, so that’s how I kept my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded an Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese people with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people contracting HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
Because of the conservative values of country, according to studies, 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often, the diseases are transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staffer leaked data from Republican senators and calls it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters disagrees with the allegations that one of her staff members posted the personal details of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia page.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the accusations are being disseminated by “extreme-right” whistleblowers and websites.
"Lies, lies, and even more vile lies," Waters said in a statement.
The published data would include the private address and telephone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The records appeared online on Thursday and were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct to Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office and contained the information of a Waters employee, de Hill said.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was under no circumstances responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly met with criticism online, among other things by former White House press officer Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“You can see from this that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a congressman.
If someone is accused of something he hasn’t done, he shouldn’t get angry.
He should not become rebellious.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger at Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters's place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“Heavy, if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will make the perpetrators known,” she said, “and that they will be held legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British flavor, we are now traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that indeed seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action movies starring a lazy spy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-satisfaction about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English, with bouncing eyes and flexible facial features, manages to control everything, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already deduce that he is a general comic character that was conceived for cinema goers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a hint of Mr. Bean and a hint of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who once played Atkinson in Barclaycard’s television commercials (which everyone has since forgotten) that always leaves a certain chaos behind.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and taps the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson can well show how much talent he has for physical comedy in this film, but the humor seems rather weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now that the "serious" film series such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do so well.
The humor seems intended for children rather than adults, and the crazy calamity of Johnny English seems to me less original and focused than the jokes without text of the character Bean that plays Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great trouble.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, revealing the identity of all the active secret agents of Britain, to the dismay of the agent in office, a sadly small role of Kevin Eldon.
Emma Thompson is doing her utmost with this character that reminds of Teresa May, but the script doesn’t offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she must employ a retired spy, as every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunting Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic setting, but teaches unofficially about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spying lessons of English remind me of School of Rock.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic helper Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is the captain of a submarine, a turbulent and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister unfortunately falls for the charismatic technology billionaire's charms that claim he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of clever crazy fun: dressed as waiters, they set a flashy French restaurant on fire, kicking noise aboard Volta’s luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house.
For the latter, all registers are opened, but no matter how well-intentioned and turbulent the scene is, she does something like children’s television.
It's not all very original.
And just like the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson’s talent?
Labour denies that the party is working on a plan whereby British people work four days a week but are paid for five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan whereby British people work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
According to reports, the party would like corporate bosses to pass on the savings they are making as a result of the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
This way, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea ‘fits’ into the party’s economic agenda and plans to make the country’s balance tilt towards the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Confederation of Trade Unions, which considers it a good way to ensure that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen from one moment to the other, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits in with the party’s drive to make the balance sheet in the economy more for the benefit of workers and that also fits in with the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the effort is not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: "A four-day working week is not a party's policy intention and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to clarify his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the “faceless drivers” and the “profits” of utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their shares, as a Labour government could apply “discounts” based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the boards of directors of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds that will give 10 percent of private sector shares to employees who can earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week, raising the question whether the FBI’s findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday at 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him, after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be staggering.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see any new developments.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will perform and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
Concertgoers who want to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful awareness for the purpose: ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 more years to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call to action or is this just another form of ‘clitivism’, making people feel like they’re making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” of supporters have been registered, targeting a wide range of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to global leaders’ commitment and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that need to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important statements of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the UK aimed at “helping children realize their full potential.” This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote in history of the social injustice that is malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent asking the UK government to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government has announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen’s website, it was asked, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
He said, “It will be a long and difficult road, and we will fall and fail sometimes.
But, just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will eventually be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform this year at the event in New York that will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could deploy the navy for a 'blockade' to block Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can resort to the Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Home Secretary, as noted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to trade in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has that ability, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come to market," he said.
Zinke spoke to guests at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that labels itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went further, comparing Washington’s approach to Russia with the approach to Iran, noting that these do not differ materially.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less using and replacing fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a country that only knows a ‘art’, with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that offers by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw its sights from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Berlin’s Trum, has made Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s powerful opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," Russian Energy Secretary Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industry organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously' about taking part in 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she was "seriously thinking" about taking part in the presidential election after the midterm election.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the election.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to repair the damaged government, and this also means a woman in the top position,” she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren spoke out against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall, saying he is “steering this country in the wrong direction.”
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we have to wait for an investigation by the FBI before voting on this.”
However, an opinion poll published Thursday found that a majority of Warren’s own supporters believe she should not be running for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to an opinion poll by the Political Research Center of Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of her being elected.
The study showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with a possible participation in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump’s election rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking up duty in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"Through what my own son is going through, what he's going through now that he's back, I understand other families experiencing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience attending a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of her son and other veterans “they come back a little differently, they come back and have become harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all other military have given for the homeland.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interfering in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence, according to police spokesman Dan Bennett.
Washington D.C. and 18 states back protest against new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. filed a statement with the Washington court last Friday as a "friend-of-the-court" in support of an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in August against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his violent sons who are members of a gang” abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was then detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people are applying for asylum in the U.S., as countries that face major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The U.S.’s new asylum policy has reversed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision, allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores dozens of years of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an impediment is contrary to that principle,” the court said in a statement.
The lawyers further argue that the policies that deny immigrants access to the U.S. are damaging to the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and provide the country with the necessary labor.
In June, Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions ordered judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asylum is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these are serious problems that people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of deaths doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents returned to their devastated homes and searched in their wet possessions for valuables they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals are overcrowded, as long as they have not been damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
Several wounded, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the possibility of severe aftershock.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remnants of a wall,” Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Hurrying’ With ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advert in a US daily promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump recently referred to the paid appendix of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation denied by China.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked, according to US officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed ever higher import tariffs on each other.
China’s retaliation rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," as Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now is doubling the harassment by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China is using freedom of speech and a free press, a long-held tradition in America, by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at a kiosk in downtown Beijing, you will find in vain dissenting voices and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have about the difficult economic trajectory, because the media is firmly under the thumbs of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article", as he did not say which newspaper this was.
Through the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans alienated female voters just before the midterm election, analysts warn
Now that many important Republicans are gathering around Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court candidate, and defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts are warning that this will cause a setback, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotion around this topic has been huge and most Republicans have already said they want to go on with the vote.
“These things can’t be reversed,” Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he wondered if Senator Jeff Flake (Republican, Arizona)’s last-minute effort to advocate for an FBI investigation would be enough to satisfy the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate hall as Republicans who have controlled the Justice Committee chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, and that’s true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote even if they disagree with the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she further elucidated her allegation of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that there could be a setback if Republicans pushed through the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," former Republican Party leader Michael Steele said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote in the committee, or the final vote, or Kavanaugh taking place in court, but it’s also about how Republicans handled this and how they treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected, told the news channel.
However, the Americans turn out to be divided on who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority signing up for the latter’s side.
A recent YouGov opinion poll shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or likely to believe Ford’s testimony and 35 percent are sure or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had certainly or probably lied during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s presidency, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford swore on oath to the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the guiding thought behind Inrupt.
"We need to do this now," he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own ‘personal online data storage’ or POD.
It can store lists of contacts, activity lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to which information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not have conversations with “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will completely turn all their business models upside down at once.”
“We are not asking for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “the mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Ecclesiastical and Carrier of the Victoria Cross Honored from World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England to have acquired a Victoria Cross as a military during World War I is honored in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel, the Reverend Bernard Vann received the award following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and thus never knew that he had received the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under fierce fire of field guns and machine guns".
He later stormed through to the fire line and led the line forward before running alone to a field gun and knocking out three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never beat, but also something that makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also lay a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to play a part in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evidenced by the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you’ve stayed up all night watching a crowded Bellator 206 and you’re not getting to see the most important moment.
The billboard from San Jose featured 13 fights, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised when the station switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were outraged because they had stayed awake all night especially for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke."
"According to government regulations, content that is not suitable for children should no longer be shown after 6:00 a.m., which is why we had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yesss."
Scott Coker, business president of Bellator, said they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that viewers in the UK will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the return game, we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were a lot of texts going back and forth and believe me, these weren’t all as friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can promise that this will not happen a second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally already did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his childhood because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary school, he didn’t realize that ‘not everyone is like me’.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that parenting had contributed to his lesser appreciation of winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first program, Daley told the BBC that during his childhood he felt "less" than others because it was "socially unacceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said, “To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different are real facts that have given me the strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone” so that he would not disappoint people if they eventually found out his nature.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a striking campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "completely surprised me."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you have to endure so much so young,” he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already received the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, you're not going to be there to sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I could finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I had been dreaming about this all my life. Diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first music choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had seized him strongly on the way to the games and that he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs can be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he must regain his form to avoid making it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is taking part in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to figure out what it lacks.
Because he was never known for his straight drives even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs erring balls routinely punishes.
And if the track itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson will come in the ninth match on Sunday against always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who is linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the start of the 12 single matches start well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, even though he honestly couldn’t do anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the back, put his arm around me and said he's ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two matches.
I expected more of it, but it is as it is and it is the way we think we should act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson could improve Nick Faldo’s record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could also mark the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he never quite matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, lost 20 matches and played 7 matches on his behalf, but Furyk said his presence had a certain intangible influence on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s caught up, he likes to make jokes with people and he’s a great guy to have on the team,” he said.
“I think the younger players liked to fool him every once in a while last week, which was fun to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the singles matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Danish made his debut in the match in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually passed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just,” said Bjorn, called off here after seeing the 2018 squad win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not a game yet.
Everybody will have to be fully committed tomorrow.
Get started and execute the plan in the right way.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy, and we have to keep focusing on that.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we’re also aware of the people who are on the other side, some of the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never anticipate things in this area.
Tomorrow is another challenge.
Tomorrow the individual achievements will be discussed, and that is another very different discipline.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re on your own, your abilities as a golfer are only really tested.
That’s the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So let your partner go now and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the ‘Miracle of Medinah’.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had cheered up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches ahead tomorrow, but let's try to get off to a good start, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We’ve tailored our line-up to this and sent the men on their way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we’re going to try something out of the hat tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counter-offensive and uses Rory McIlroy for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I chose this group in this order because I think we're so constantly covered," Bjorn said of his selection of single players.
Germany's new warship postponed
The latest German naval frigate should have come into service in 2014, replacing the outdated warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will take at least another year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which a military spokesman quotes.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the navy in 2007 serve to replace the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they feature a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features include longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years in a row, far away from home ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are put into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The fateful frigate F125 made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited some crucial “software and hardware defects” that would render the warship useless if deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship suffers from severe overweight, which will reduce performance and limit the ability of the Navy to carry out further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tonnes, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class deployed by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, also becomes a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip are becoming extra important due to recent warnings that the power of the German navy is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defense committee in Germany, acknowledged that the navy is actually "deficient in deployable ships".
The official said the problem has grown over time like a snowball because old ships were taken out of service but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available to be enlisted in the navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New research conducted on a estate in the Scottish highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common and small dwarf bat, the brown big ear bat, and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to track the bats’ activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat screams and what kind of what does.
Subsequently, a map of the habitat and a report are produced to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS’s conservation advisor, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out examinations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even established the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten species of bats live.
Landscape Manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much is not yet known about bats and therefore the work we do here and in other locations will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of bat monitoring before maintenance work is carried out, as the potential unconscious destruction of a sleeping place could lead to the deaths of 400 female bats and their cubs, potentially exterminating a complete local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and from many of our species we simply don’t know how their populations are.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of assault as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo accusations of assault qualifies as "fake news" and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the accusations have been published.
Portugal and Juventus are accused of assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports “fake news” a few hours after the allegations were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by mentioning my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the trade.
I'm a lucky man, and by and by good," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they called “an inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the footballer wants compensation for the "moral damage for an amount equal to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped her anally, as read in the indictment filed before the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a "good guy" for "99 percent", but that he is sometimes abandoned that "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had had sex, but that this was with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photographs were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was "frightened by the consequences" and because she was concerned about the "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old now says she wants to have the scheme declared invalid because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and left for Italian giant Juventus this summer in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' if car manufacturers leave
The UK “will forever regret” if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays at the border would cost jobs in the event of a ‘no-deal Brexit’.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory shut down,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the case of a ‘no-deal Brexit’.
Toyota’s production line is based on the ‘just-in-time’ principle, with parts arriving from suppliers in the UK and in the EU every 37 minutes for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, turmoil could erupt at the borders, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day of stock at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and in that case production would be shut down.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is “exactly aligned to avoid those border controls.”
"We need to have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only allow us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of the Today program on BBC Radio 4'.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be shut down, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company’s competitiveness and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein meeting could be delayed, White House says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump and Russia’s assistants and possible impeachment of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has kept the Washington gossip machine going for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to depose the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors circulated that he was about to file his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would not "lovely" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing by the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the full Senate once again.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press chief, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There's no date yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by an aversion to the "attractive" TV journalists, though, she added: "I won't deny that they're trying to draw attention."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president is doing more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," she said, without providing evidence: "We've looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to directly ask the president of the United States, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
"We're trying a lot to do that and you've seen us do that a lot in recent weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, he made a frank and at times bizarre appearance for the gathered reporters.
Health Minister writes a letter about Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The health minister has written a letter to EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and desire to continue working at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer the negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this fall the expected decisions will be made.
But at the same time, the UK government has also bolstered preparations for a possible scenario where no deal is reached.
I know these must be uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the NHS’s work and bring benefits to the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers' line baker, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery yesterday after suffering a head injury in the 31-27 loss match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed there more or less," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen directly on the sideline, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury” and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was tackled a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him tackled a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when buying a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless according to new Conservative plans
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn’s success to attract young voters
The increase in the levy is levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year, to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes when they buy a house in the UK and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn who is attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and to recount this on high earners.
The increase in the levies is levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional proceeds being invested in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current levies, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and homes purchased for rental, could go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year in this way.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which drives prices up and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the home ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become virtually “ghost cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had advocated for a reduction in fees to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping prices high by buying land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable homes in order to remedy the “housing disgrace” in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a striking series of housing reforms, including lease ceilings and an end to deportation “without negligence.”
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on restoring the ‘British Dream’, that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it can’t be as easy for people who don’t live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy homes here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has once become too vague a dream, and the humiliation of life without a roof over its head is all too real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his "ultimate ambition" to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the northeast of England, currently in third place in League One, at three points of first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership the previous season.
“As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and with that the sock was done,” Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a child, I often saw Scotland play with my father in Hampden Park and it’s something that keeps attracting me.
However, that opportunity would only come when I’m successful in managing a club.”
Ross's predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, previously he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is measured by 'can I have this club return to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there.”
Ross is only engaged in his career as a manager for three years, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
Subsequently, he helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the verge of degradation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he recalled from the moment he took over from Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did quite well, I earned quite well and I knew a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are many things that you are faced with every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the trade, but management just feels good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m real, I’m in the best of shape as I’ve never felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, research reveals
The summer heat wave has raised the revenues of British pubs struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues were 4.8 percent lower, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting firm CGA, who collected the figures, said: “Continued sunshine and the fact that England participated in the world championships for longer than expected meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were now hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverage sales performed by far the best, with better LFL (like-for-like) growth than restaurants going down.
Pubs that are also aimed at selling food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people just went out to drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales were 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food sales were 3 percent lower.”
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the nightlife market.
It is not surprising, therefore, that restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a year-on-year turnover drop of 4.8 percent is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food-focused operators and only time will tell whether the more temperate temperatures of August can give the necessary rest.”
Total revenue growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the revenue monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sectors, performance data is collected and analyzed from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. This is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed growth in 'fake Insta pages'
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a ‘main account’ that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years, create social media accounts that keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the “fake Insta accounts,” a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean ‘main account’ that they show to their parents, while also having personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally landed on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who asked others to "rape" her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to holding personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teens are lured into creating online spaces where they’re not found by their parents and teachers.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Council, as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and Chairman Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the sport’s drivers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from her election to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help manage the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and the 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comment on the BBC, could no longer run after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It’s been awfully hard work, but I’ve now fully recovered, I’ve learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support!”
Advertisement for breast pump comparing mothers to cows divides online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has divided the online opinion with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what’s called “the quietest portable breast pump in the world,” Elvie, a consumer technology producer, has released an ironic, music-video-inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to pounding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see it" and "In case you didn't notice, these aren't udders, these are my breasts."
The chorus then continues with: 'Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies'.
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has prompted an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has elicited hundreds of comments, mostly mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that this is the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they must conceive and give birth to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of giving birth.”
The breast pump from Elvie fits discreetly in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else remarked, "This is obviously traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don’t we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “This ad is so far from reality.”
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song “hilarious.”
“I think this is a genius idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
That pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit weird, but I haven't searched for it too much.
“This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Someone else had the following remark: “This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who are pumping (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like just ‘cows’.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you can see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who are pumping sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and discreetly fits into a feeding bra, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on flasks.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing pumping mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the pumping and the associated challenges in the spotlight, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will create an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has hit the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski’s catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children tacitly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has peaked, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves and are afraid to jeopardize their own chance to stay in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their household would have to release their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before the congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
We are prosecuting these people,” said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the start of detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the shelter employees.
Many of them will stand in court through a video conference, rather than in person, to defend their application for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is struggling are more often ignored, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., France and Turkey ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vice-premier, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "this will be handled accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the “war on terror” is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and driven from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this sacred struggle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions are favorable for their return and he accused "of spreading irrational fears to some Western countries" leaving most refugees away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
“They are politicizing a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major bulwark of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has averted a large-scale attack by Russia-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement has “clear deadlines” and said he hoped that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
U.N. Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear what the Syrian government’s conditions are to participate in the committee and said the panel’s work should be limited “to the revision of the articles of the current constitution” and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Legislature
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many “liberal” viewers probably hope, his presidency is prematurely terminated by a deposition process and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever.”
At the moment, however, there are no signs of watching fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s prime-time viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during “prime time,” compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” from MSNBC is at the top of the ratings for cable shows with 3.5 million viewers on important news evenings.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designated Survivor' a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club," has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said 'Because he makes me laugh'," Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen, when you notice that you've been sitting for six hours watching a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which talks about the paw leather jacket of Paul Manafort, the $15,000 issue of which has been discussed ('a garment full of Daniel')
I will never be able to watch Super Mario the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show is partly that he's putting you something new every night," Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', said about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode or you have the feeling you’re lagging behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember doing all those weird shows not so long ago, and people were saying 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

External money flows into the most exciting midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is seeing an influx of money, thanks to a rearrangement of a constituency that requires two incumbents to compete for the same seat.
The recently rearranged Pittsburg district hits Democratic MP Conor Lamb, who has won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must face another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional ("gerrymandering") in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a brawl in the field of campaign funding between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a well-reviewed special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points of difference.
According to political experts, Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China and has renounced it
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," the ministry's spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador because the country received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference that would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving for the United States.
But in mid-September, some top government officials said they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan now is for Vice President Mike Pence to deliver a speech at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further excitement, without any harsh messages about Washington’s punitive measures.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible counter-acting of the justice system, for which weighty evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on collusion between Trump’s and Russia’s campaign in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump will have to answer for that institution, just as he’s getting ready to address the voters again, and maybe he’ll have to answer for a jury in a court.
That’s a lot of mitsen, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There will be choices to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a "coup d'état" against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and thus missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bends, and the relentless advance of democracy is thereby accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing various of these kinds of bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this magazine reported that, last year, he had suggested to record talks with the president in secret and that he had speculated about the president’s suitability for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
“How will we react if the FBI’s newly requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and a dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we be voting in the midterm elections for a Congress that Trump will hold accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will wait for a very long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, to light candles for the Sabbath on that table depicting a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers get Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out the game with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but over the whole game, a match is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is another great European night.
Hopefully we can score three points, but it will be a difficult game because they also had a good result in their last game, but if the audience gets behind us, I’m sure we can push through and that we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been hard, of all that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feel-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave the past season behind and be successful again.”
Women can’t sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
Approximately half of the Nationwide survey participants said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps necessary to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's where we're gonna start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not make your wishes known in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Take a financial advisor in your arm: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or use equity as an insurance as long as you have money.
Establish your legal documents: Avoid legal strife when the insurance needs to be used.
Provide a health care proxy so that you can designate a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals adhere to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that the invoices are paid if you can no longer do this yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine your elderly father or mother hit a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Record these details in a written plan so you have the information on hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes out.”
Man shot several times with air-pressure rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air-pressure rifle as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called for witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the means of communication have been switched off, the official bodies have not yet received any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regentship, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Agency for Disaster Control of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the Richter scale occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-strong earthquake on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a more than 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed around 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice presidency, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence, and offering resistance during the conviction, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in custody in the Mat-Su detention house with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, sure" when asked to do so, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and to a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now in front of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic abuse, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possessing a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veterans group in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD, which he allegedly left on his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale has caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place right next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City, in which eight people have been killed, a rare sentence that has not been enforced in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, overturning pedestrians and cyclists who came along his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious physical injuries, according to the letter of intent demanding the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder on behalf of a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and preparation,” according to the prosecutors, and they described the way in which Sajpov carried out the attack as “horrible, cruel and depraved.”
"Sajfoello Habiboellayevich Sajpov has inflicted injury, damage and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement of intent read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than a decade since a case in the Southern District of New York called for the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was enforced in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by means of the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the detectives that he felt good about his actions, they the police.
Sajpov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the indictment with 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
“We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life imprisonment with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Sajpov's defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to mobilize a “popular army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the UKIP said the politicians should “feel the heat” of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told attendees at the Birmingham march that the UK would be “already out” if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge posed by May in reconciling the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who are participating in a separate protest rally against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the ride while this is being attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Supporters insisted that she will continue and will try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and ‘chaos’.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to 'throw Chequers in the trash'.
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was out of service, we'd be out now," Bone said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the trash.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false."
Conservative Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, telling reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go door-to-door and ensure that we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a targeted message to May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should “feel the heat” if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We won’t let you get away with this.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: “I want you to set fire to our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again.”
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this march with a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists waved flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the formation of this group on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour High House, joked about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can provide IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to 'go ahead' on candidacy for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "well consider her candidacy for the presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican deputy who co-chaired Trum’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculations that she might fight Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
One of the participants asked her if she would be eligible for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to repair our defective government and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrest after shooting LSU's Wayde Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested after shooting Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound in the head and died of the consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has confessed to being present at the crime scene, possessing a firearm and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory after orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits and let Hamilton drive in the crowds in the group's tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on the head after a wheel-to-wheel action that forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly release space on the inside after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Subsequently, he was a long time leader of the race, because he stayed with his tyre choice and aimed for a fast finish so that he could catch up with Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He went to the pits in the 44th round, after which he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen was fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, he was a real gentleman and he let me go.
The team has done their best for the places one and two,” Hamilton said.
That was not good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election rally on Saturday over the fact that she persisted not to be the source of Christine Blasey Ford’s leaked letter, in which Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Justice Committee, but instead stated that what happened in the Senate showed that people can be “bad, unkind and untrue.”
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and unkind and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I haven't leaked."
Well, wait a minute.
"No, we haven't leaked," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter mentioning the accusations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein has denied that her agency was the leak.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to handle it confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president turned out not to believe her denial and he commented at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, that wasn't good body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who is accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to seize power with all necessary means.
You see the vileness, the dishonesty, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to seize power and regain control,” the president said, according to a report from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs. Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals leading by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie sidelined the home team before Dwyer brought the Giants back to lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equaliser for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make up for a lag on Friday night to then defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt took the lead for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the first rest with a lead when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team recaptured and Bouchard again put them on a par with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He secured the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while allowing hundreds to escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died for making sure a plane with hundreds of people on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried under the dot in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly moving back and forth traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then ready on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News from Australia reported.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter had reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the death toll may rise to thousands, and the country’s disaster response agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Each minute, bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the soldiers present: "I call on all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks necessary for the evacuation.
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Says One Man Is Missing After a Lagoon Crash
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one more man is missing, after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sunk plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger was missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed during the landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities announced Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what the exact sequence of events is remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses say the plane was shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and a few others managed to wade the water coming to their waist to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he had a not serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors working nearby at a yard also helped with the rescue work by taking people to the shore by an inflatable boat, before the plane sank further into about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the past 20 years, 111 people have been found dead in crashes of air carriers registered with the PNG, but none of this relates to Air Niugini.
Analyst captures the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisition on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used mobile phone call records to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received the location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford again.
Sanford stood in the witness stand on Saturday and told me he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told him he was at Sanford in his truck during that night, Sanford said he "lies because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis wiped the texts, calls, and contact details from his phone some time after Chambers' death.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense begins on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin the deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hip hop'?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol state that hip hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hip hop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A nanny from New York takes a couple to court over a 'racist' text
A nanny from New York is suing a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after she received a wrongly sent text in which the mother complained about "again such a black".
The couple denies being racist and called the lawsuit “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a Negro woman when she met her on her first day at work in 2016.
'NEEEEE WEATHER SO BLACK,' Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Maurice when she realized her blunder, stating that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she was therefore expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice challenges the couple to court to get compensation of $350,-- per day for the 6 months she was hired to work internally with the family, though without a contract.
“I want them to feel like you’re just not doing that,” Maurice told The New York Post last Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple bit off regarding the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they, by insulting her, feared they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, man."
Comparing the lawsuit to “extortion,” Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was “in a very difficult situation.”
"Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic," the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is pending, public opinion is quick to chapter the couple on social media, where they are denounced for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers feared the public wouldn’t be interested in a talking bear, reveals newly emerged letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's approval, said of the letter: "It's hard to get into the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington’s tremendous success, it’s very entertaining.”
She told her father who, before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, worked as a cameraman at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be disapproved. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt 'bittersweet' after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very prominent member of the family," she said, her father was secretly proud of the eventual success.
She said, "He was a quiet, humble man."
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost looked like a child's achievement; you're proud when you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he almost experienced Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for his success.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that they expected her not to make it," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad’s phone call came to say that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly worked out and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process ended everything further.
I could just sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t complain, scream or cry, because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I really had to stay big.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I sat with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning Women Stick Messages on Bridge to Prevent Suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are making themselves strong to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in the English county of Gloucestershire, tells us that her son was a promising chef with a contagious grin.
“He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile illuminated every room.”
Yet he already stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after robbing himself of life.
Mrs Davis said, "I am constantly worried that there will be a chain reaction."
Ms. Davis has made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t keep quiet, talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling gloomy or depressed or anything like that," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all the way to the ground on Christmas Day - when the kids unpacked their presents, he didn't look at them at all or anything."
She said that his death was a big trauma for her, but that they had to deal with it: “It’s ripping the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we all have to go on and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as FBI starts investigation
“I thought that if we can actually get what he is asking for; an investigation limited in time and scope, then maybe we could create some more unity again,” said Flake last Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was ‘disintegrating’ in the midst of a firmly anchored stalemate within the party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are already in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country will be severely hampered.
George W. Bush has already called members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus got to know his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI gets the report ready?
Then there will be a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Mike Pence, vice president, the opportunity to cast the decisive vote to confirm Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, who quotes data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, states that there were 1,127 overruns last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for smugglers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
The vast majority of North Koreans are eventually offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea, and where it is easier to cross than in the highly secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often deports them by force.
Relations between North and South, which are still formally at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, discussing the stagnated negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, in which they largely agreed to work towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Secretary Ri Yong-ho accused the US of a lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
"Without faith in US action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and finds him unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called candidate for U.S. Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and found him unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview, Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved like that, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes almost screamed and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school years.
He also emphatically condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him "gross and coordinated character murder," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifiing himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats," Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to institute a impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or to the FBI, he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would oppose the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade, after all, Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh circumvented questions about revising certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
"Don't expect us to cheer when a hysterical, biased person is appointed to the Supreme Court," Pelosi said.
Women just have to give in to this.
It’s a just tirade of months and years of crawling anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
“We’re going to cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s weird, do you?”
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge somewhere and who told me that she too would cry when she got angry. She developed a method where she would cry every time she got angry. To the person she was talking to, she said, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought that was brilliant.”
Tears are partially permissible as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially misunderstood.
One of my best memories from a former job, in a men-dominated office, was when I had to cry terribly because I was terribly angry. An elderly woman, a cold business manager that everyone was a bit afraid of, grabbed my neck skin and dragged me into a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Congress for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally meaning 'cat madness' or 'monkey strokes') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt there was no reason why she would not apply.
"It wasn't an informed decision," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she lagged behind with fundraising, so she solemnly vowed not to participate if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who would give $1,000 to men, wanted to give her only $250.
"Maybe they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign anyway, she was so overwhelmed by feelings — of gratitude for the people who supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and of reaching voters instead of delegates, and of anger over sexism — that she suffocated.
“They will have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to her.
"They will have thought that Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She was crying?"
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening salutes of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle has not yet been fought, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by raising taxes on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was announced this week when new effective, increased tax rates were unveiled for $200 billion ($150 billion) in goods — half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken in kind reprisals every time, most recently by raising tariffs from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the US every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink its eyes quickly.
In order for Washington to bow, requests must be granted, but publicly bowing to the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays it smart, the trade war with the US could support China positively in the longer term, as the interdependence of the two economies decreases.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could cause either country to fall into an economic free fall is actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security issues, which focuses on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to allow refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year war.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are about six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the 'Le Golf National' golf course southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was wrestling almost the entire tournament, had his long blow from the tee in the water at par 3, hole 16, admitting his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shone in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was kicked out by the lowest-scoring European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes to play.
The highest ranked player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play by Ian Poulter of Great Britain, who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Segio Garcia, with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole to go in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The tremendous pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods, and I've been following that guy as I grew up," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the greatest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled over the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
For a short time this morning we made Europe a little more difficult.
We resisted.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
