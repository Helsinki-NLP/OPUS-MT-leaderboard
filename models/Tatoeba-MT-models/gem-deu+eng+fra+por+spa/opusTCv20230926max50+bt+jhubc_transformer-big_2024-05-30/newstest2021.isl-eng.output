Shouting to the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well and shouts and calls out in the wild are starting to attract people all over the world.
“You have the mystery, I need Iceland,” says a woman in the big world in comments to an ad from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another spectator says he will keep Iceland in his heart forever, and a young woman says she must come to Iceland as soon as possible because her fiancé lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States and expects to have to wait for a few more months.
Another viewer asks if the walk to Iceland is possible, because there are no planes.
I don’t know if it comes from a different time zone.
Egill <0xC3><0x9E>ór<0xC3><0xB0>arson of the Peel advertising agency, who came to make the ads together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says receptions have been hoped for later.
“I came across many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already breaking records.
Basically, this is about creating a PR value, it’s getting the foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it’s gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, covering a total of more than two billion people.
The value of this coverage is valued at ISK 1.8 billion.
It's not awkward."
The main market is usually the United States and the campaign has gone very well, although the Americans are not on their way to the country in a hurry.
According to Egils, well-known markets such as Denmark, the UK and Germany have also welcomed them, such as Russia, which will come as a pleasant surprise.
Then there were reactions from foreign regions, such as India, which was not specifically proposed.
“These ads have travelled farther than we expected,” says Egill, who may have seen more than four million people on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better start.”
The photos at the opening were taken by <0xC3><0x81>rni S<0xC3><0xA6>berg, photographer of Morgunbla<0xC3><0xB0>inn, in the middle of last month’s “Let It Out” ads.
The roofs took place wide and wide, such as at the School Guard in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöf<0xC3><0xB0>ur.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll <0xC3><0x93>lafsson at Skoti productions and the recording artist <0xC3><0x93>ttar Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason.
In the roles were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to make the advertisements, but at the same time as the recordings took place in Southern Iceland, there was another group in Western Iceland and the Westfjords.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, which is aimed at a winter campaign in partnership with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for <0xC3><0x8D>slandsstofa,” says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone very well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge in the markets we are talking to.”
Sprengisandur: Discuss the situation in the labour market, pension funds and much more
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, will be present in Sprengisand, which starts at 10 o’clock on the Gulf today.
He is also Minister of Labour and discusses the position in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more.
He also discusses rural issues and moves to a country that has gone badly and has been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E>ór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, will also attend the show, but he will discuss his criticisms regarding pension funds’ investments and propose ideas that trade unions and employers should withdraw from the boards of the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
<0xC3><0x8D>var Ingimarsson, tourism manager in East Iceland, and <0xC3><0x81>rnhei<0xC3><0xB0>i Jóhannsdóttir, manager of the Nordic Market Office, will discuss the position of tourism in the countryside.
They will look forward to autumn and wonder if the success of summer is a misleading foretold of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, which starts at 10 o’clock.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in adolescent shows of all kinds.
She starred as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has happened to her lately, but she got to look across the road and comment on Clueless on Australian television these days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I built the character mostly on girls I met at school who weren’t good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that character was,” Donovan said about his game in Clueless.
He didn’t want to leave the police station at night.
About fifty cases were brought to the police in the capital area today and the police's diary says that the cases were diverse.
The day at the police station at Hverfisgata began with police having to deal with a man who had recently been released from prison after staying there because of a drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the police orders that told him to leave.
The man continued to stay at the police station because of his progress.
Then a man was arrested in the morning suspected of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to interfere with two men in Breidholt because of reports of a body attack.
In addition, a woman who was sitting at a shopping mall in Kopavogur could not pay for the bill after a meal and was therefore called to the police.
It was also reported that the car was stolen in the city centre this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked at her for a moment and she was then taken unfree hand.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Joy Band - The Horrible Destiny of the Glacier Stars
The theory has flourished on the Internet that the series is under a curse, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California on the days, becoming the third main actor of the show to leave her life long ahead of time.
The Glee series is a popular series about singing, dancing, and joy.
The episodes covered the so-called youth group of joy in high school, their love and destiny.
It was not always taken out with the seal of being in the joy band, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the shows seemed to overcome every situation that came up in their lives.
But outside the scene, a great deal of disaster has ravaged the actors and employees of the show, so much so that theories have awakened that the curse rests on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the series, a cheerleader who did not call her all her grandmother.
After the season ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had their first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced them.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found drifting in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy found himself sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat, and he was able to tell the police that he and his mother had stabbed themselves to swim, and then Rivera had brought him back to the boat but never returned there himself.
A great search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area reported that we had assumed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially sentenced to death.
She is believed to have fallen into a heavy current in the water and renewed her last claim to the rescue of her son.
The cause of death was recorded as being drowned in accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the angel's voice who played a key role in bringing the Joy Orchestra to glory and honor.
Outside of the show, however, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his co-workers in the show felt enough, intervened and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed to look all the better.
Just two months after completing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after having fun with friends.
Banamein proved to be a deadly mixture of drugs and alcohol.
I didn’t think we were talking about voluntary work.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for drug addicts had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death weighed heavily on his co-workers, but on the basis of his opponent, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue recording the shows and dedicated a full part to the memory of Moneith and Finn's character.
Mark Wayne Salling played Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Joy Band, or all the way until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of child porn possession.
We searched his home and found a huge amount of child porn and the matter soon became publicly known.
It was clear that Sally had been there.
He was convicted and convicted of his crimes.
He faced four to seven years in prison in addition to having to be on a list of sexual offenders and seeking treatment for childbirth.
Before the judge had decided the sentence, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn’t just the actors who died long ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He fell asleep at the age of 41 in 2013.
The show also featured a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of big star Julia Roberts, and did not share the beautiful story with her sister, but she accused Roberts of great governance and disgraceful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancée telling her mother and sister, among other things, that she was responsible for her situation.
“My mother and my so-called siblings will have nothing left of me but the memory that they caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and assaulting her fellow actors on the scene and of having a transient stardom.
Jesse Luken starred in the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was a major scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
It happened in 2010 that rude computer scammers came up with nude pictures of her and published on the Internet.
Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the series and had a love affair outside of the series.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It increases the development of children when they are allowed to play outdoors in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and to watch them grow and thrive.
It can also be done infinitely with flowers, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a little time with the kids in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
I bought a boat in the 10th grade.
“I don’t think we are many seafarers who work in the country’s kindergartens,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, who pursues beach fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter season.
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it’s great to be able to skip taking student loans.
The income is also good enough for me in the winter," says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist who pursues beach fishing this summer as well as the past summer.
Axel was the newest person to dock at T<0xC3><0xA5>lknafjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur when a journalist spoke of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“The weather I was in the tenth grade I took boarding rights for boats that are under twelve meters long and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished elementary school.
I’ve been fishing on my boat for a long time.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I had the boat named his name.
Hartmann was grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat carried his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
I had the boat at the end of my first summer on him.
But how could a boy have one and a half million dollars to pay out on a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“I had already planned and collected money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my money in my boat fund.”
Axel was born in <0xC3><0x8D>safjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Kopavogur since he was a boy.
“I can fish here in the West because I have a law office with my grandmother in <0xC3><0x8D>safjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur.
I learned in this area here west of Roosters with my dad.
I move between the distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although I feel like I’m better off in the west, I’ve also provided around the Sn<0xC3><0xA6>fellsnes and beyond.
I’ve also provided for the south, but then I prefer a grey release,” says Axel, who always steals one early fire in the morning and sometimes says he talks to the seagulls and sings for the sky, in solitude for hours on the ball sea.
“The network on the sea is good, so I can call, listen to TV shows and music.
I don’t think it’s important to be alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid being in danger, but there have certainly been occasional weather events, but never a great risk,” says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes each time.
“In beach fishing, I never spend more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example, in the rental quota, but then I’ve been continuously for a day and a half grazing out at sea fishing.”
According to him, the fishing arrangements at the beach allow him to catch 770 kilos a day, which he finds hampering.
“Other limitations are that I am not allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish twelve days a month, during these four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, seafarers should choose their fishing days depending on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to calm down instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and being able to choose according to their own head.
So the division of the area could also go because of me and the sea space that is well located by the fisheries should be able to enjoy it," says Axel, who draws most of the cod from the salt of the sea in his coastal fishing, but also only owls and unique other species of rivers.
Axel works over the winter time with his university studies at the Núpi preschool in Kópavogur.
“I don’t think we’re many seafarers working in the country’s kindergartens,” Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily in the kindergarten.
“I’m stuck there because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that my psychology studies will be useful for me in the preschool in the future," says Axel, who is also a long-time student of business studies.
Error in registration prevented homecoming behavior
An error in a registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country caused a person residing in this country not to be recalled for sampling.
A registration number is not required if the person fills out the form in English, as is the case in Icelandic.
“This will be reviewed this week,” says a specialist in the field of fetal health.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed in the Department of Veterinary Medicine yesterday.
One of them, who proved positive, arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the rules on so-called return policy came into force.
Those who were resident in Iceland are then screened upon arrival in the country and again invited in sampling four to five days later.
At noon, however, it was reported that he had followed the old system.
The sample data on the border was negative and he was not called back in screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, a specialist in the field of national medicine, said in a conversation with a news agency that this may be due to an error in the electronic registration form.
Filling out the registration form in English is not a requirement to insert an ID number as is in the Icelandic version.
First and foremost, it was for foreigners.
Therefore, the person concerned has not been automatically invited to enter the sampling.
Kamilla says, however, many have followed the rules of the home port even though they have filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people for sampling back after they arrived in the country.
“This week we will be looking at how to make it easier for people to draw attention to this process.”
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all went to the sampling, but two were beginning to show symptoms.
Infection is currently underway for the three infections that were diagnosed yesterday, but it is mostly completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequential analysis of Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the ties have focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who carried the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be tomorrow where the other virus would be coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation according to the website COVID. is.
There are 135 of them.
Four out of five infections offline
Five domestic infestations have been detected here in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unconnected and, to form a picture, the origin of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup sporting event yesterday has not been found.
Infection is still ongoing.
Originally, at the third dozen, they were uniquely sent to sick quarries, but they were reduced to sixteen.
There are a total of 34 infectious diseases due to these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that infection is detected in sports events and it has raised questions about whether or not to hold such events.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, Head of Communications at the Department of Public Protection, says it slowly, as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
“We are constantly advocating for all those who live here that there is a need to maintain individual immunity.
We also need to warn people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
“You can have an event,” Josh said.
He says that infection can be prevented by holding on to individual anti-infective devices.
Rules and criteria are also under constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Protection and the National Medical Office are constantly asking people to do, is to consider these individualized anti-infectious agents.
Both at home and in the service industry.
People wash their hands and drink alcohol.
It prevents the infection from continuing," says Johann.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good path we have been on, in order to be able to sustain the success we have achieved so far.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how hard it was for her father to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, so she urged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The death was due to sudden respiratory difficulties due to coronary coronary virus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death certificate as the underlying problem and Brumfield, who is also diabetic, is afraid that the same thing will happen.
The Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
A recent study by the U.S. government found that nearly 40 percent of those who died had diabetes 2 as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion rises to half.
The United States Department of Disease Control (CDC) surveyed more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus in the period from February through May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the findings are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Reuters conducted a survey, which revealed the responses from the 12 states that responded to similar rates.
Ten states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet begun to report underlying diseases.
“Diabetes was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken through as powerful a century,” said Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, which has also gone worse out of the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease under control with physical fitness, healthy diet, and health care professional assistance.
However, the coronavirus era has made it difficult for many to keep a routine.
In addition, high prices of insulin have consumed some to continue attending work, thereby risking exposure to the virus.
According to Reuters, the U.S. government may have been aware of the risks that people with diabetes 2 might have from the virus.
When the SARS coronavirus was reversed in 2003, more than 20% of them were infected with the disease and during the swine flu epidemic in 2009, this group was three times more likely to have to be hospitalized.
When MERS was detected in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could be prolonged, the epidemic has been stripped of the veil of a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’ll see a tidal wave of problems when this is over,” said Andrew Bolton, president of the International Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus age may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new research indicates that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already ill in many people with diabetes.
In addition, high levels of glucose and lipids in diabetics can induce a true “cytokine storm”, as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can lead to fatal blood clots.
“It’s all one big puzzle,” Dela Cruz says.
“It’s all connected.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were offered champagne, so they left the room.”
The couple <0xC3><0x81>srún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason received the unusual request from the artist Ragnari Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was installing in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t difficult.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and mother-in-law, <0xC3><0x81>sruna Magnúsdóttir.
“I was very impressed with her.
Of course, it was just the radiance, but I also thought it was incredibly cute.
And still feels," he says.
The husband also remembers the first meeting on a regular basis.
“I’m always hearing this story.
Last weekend," she says, who also attracted her husband at first sight.
“I felt and feel so much excitement around Atla, which I love.
There’s a lot going on and a lot going on and I’m excited about it.”
Atli says that the couple have emphasized in their relationship to go their own way.
“We don’t tie our bags to the same knots as fellow travelers.
We avoid routines that we separate around us.”
That’s possibly why they took the initiative from Ragnari Kjartan’s son, a visual artist, just with joy, although it would be unusual to say the least.
"Our common friend Kristin Anna has contacted us and asked if we could come and have a dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg Ragnar's wife, on Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, met the trio of Snaps, and had desert wine and each other’s dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who guided them through their plans for a visual arts exhibition that he planned to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
“He had a multi-channel video project called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in a simple way.”
<0xC3><0x81>srún says he described the work as a banal and decadent sequel to the everyday life of Westerners.
“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last time he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in.”
Later, when Ragnar asked the couple to take part in the show, he was supposed to show a young middle class couple how to make love in a minimalist room.
"It's the beginning and the end," he said.
The couple didn’t know Ragnar much, even though they knew about him and he knew about them “but they knew us and felt we were fit for this.
They said they didn’t want to advertise.
Maybe they thought they wouldn’t get the right people, but people who get the sexual masturbation from performing for others.”
They shouted at Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“When we ran out of Snaps, we said, ‘Aren’t we just doing this?’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and all his team," says <0xC3><0x81>srún and Atli takes the lead.
“It’s all about love and love.”
Senan was taken up in a fine apartment on M<0xC3><0xBD>rargatan.
There were very few film teams; a filmmaker, Ragnar and a sounder and the couple.
After the recording had been switched on, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car except Atli and <0xC3><0x81>srún.
“We haven’t decided what we should be like yet.
We were given some directions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn't a game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Asrún.
But was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a bit romantic,” says Atli and <0xC3><0x81>srún agree.
“We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris.”
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved them.
“When Tommi the recorder watched this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful,” says Atli.
“It’s just as much about love as it is about the relationship,” says Asrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice of the son at Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts poking at it,” Atli says.
My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone that way, but then my dad just sent me a message saying, ‘It’s nice to see a little family in the Palais de Tokyo,’” <0xC3><0x81>srún recalls.
Is it possible that the relationship between <0xC3><0x81>srún and Atla has been deepened?
“At least we’re still together so maybe this deepened something.
This at least deepened my relationship with the family," says <0xC3><0x81>srún and laughs.
Asrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleagues.
“I found it a little hard not to be with you, but someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s just one late part of a much bigger work and when you see it with the other works, it’s really cool.
I was able to get away from this and I was just so proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says <0xC3><0x81>srún, who was pregnant by one of the couple's two children when the bean was picked up.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to <0xC3><0x81>srún and Atla in <0xC3><0x81>sárságara p<0xC3><0xA5> Rás 1.
Swansea wins their first pre-match game
Swansea won a 1-0 win over Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the semi-finals to make it to the English Premier League.
The game was played at Swansea in Wales.
The score in half was 0-0.
Swansea's homers were penalized in the 64th minute, while Andre Ayew broke the arc of the penalty point and defended.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, received the red card.
Brentford therefore played the rest of the game less and in the 82nd minute, Swansea players took advantage of the difference.
Andre Ayew then added to the game by scoring a great goal and scoring a 1–0 win for Swansea.
Swansea will lead 1–0 in the duel, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford home.
Ambassadorless for five years since 2009
U.S. Ambassador to Iceland, Jeffrey Gunter Ross, has been in the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, it has not gone smoothly for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as ambassador to the United States in April 2009, the country has been without ambassadors for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under unusual circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falcon Words.
On the way to a greeting meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the President’s office saying that she would not be honored with the word.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
It took sixteen months for Van Voorst to succeed him, in September 2010.
It may be due to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador, but resigned.
Loius Ariega had been working in the foreign service for a decade.
He resigned in the fall of 2013 and took office as ambassador to Guatemala.
Then we took another Ambassador-free period.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly afterwards, but no ambassador had been on the scene for 13 months.
Barber was a politician, not a diplomat, but a lawyer and a supporter of Barack Obama's electoral fund.
He resigned as President Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is the custom of a politically appointed ambassador.
Trump’s administration was unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the Washington administration.
It took two years before the U.S. Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him about the issues and then confirm him as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the Senate, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who has died, had been broken off the Dutch rock.
Gunter is a former dermatologist in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded them, but Adelson is a keen supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to Iceland in May 2019, when no ambassador had been in Iceland since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example in Iceland.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration was nominating people for key offices, and that in recent years, the work of the U.S. Congress has been dwindling, including confirming an ambassador for office.
Since 2009, the company has been active in Iceland for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the construction of the embassy, which recently opened its headquarters at Engjateig.
The construction is estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion, but the building is surrounded by knot-thick security walls and fireproof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have been enough to fill the current Ambassador's sense of security because he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former <0xC3><0x8D>BV player was subjected to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former <0xC3><0x8D>BV player, said he had suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regretted having come to Iceland.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny, who appeared on the Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC as a player in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in Iceland, where he played with <0xC3><0x8D>BV, Val og <0xC3><0x9E>r<0xC3><0xB8>tti in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to.
The head of the team was in that position, but besides that, he also had the jersey number that I wanted so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with <0xC3><0x8D>BV.
Among the things that Tonny talks about is the racism that he has experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
“It happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what I was told.
Later I heard about it and asked my friend what it was all about.
He then told me that my opponent had made racist comments about me after I cheated him.”
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He says he has made the mistakes he sees most.
Tonny had not made it to the starting team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he then joined Val.
“It was a mistake to get back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway for longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," Tonny says, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably go further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland was made out of his dreams of getting into the big team in Europe.
Find worms in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-cm-long black worm in a woman's throat.
Doctors managed to pull the worm out with a tong.
A study showed that there were parasites.
CNN reports on this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before, which are thinly cut meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as this are often in raw meat or fish.
After the sushi spread in the West, cases of parasites spreading to people have increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now at the forefront of concerns about a second wave of coronavirus in Europe, where the government has taken action to restrain the spread of the coronavirus era.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the infection is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action because of the increase in the number of infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to go to a quarantine on their return from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned about travelling to Spain.
Infections are also on the rise in France and Germany, as the government is trying to find a balance between curbing the spread of the virus and releasing the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to elsewhere in the world, with the incidence of transmission worldwide approaching 300.000 per day, with the most transmission in America and South Asia.
According to Johns Hopkins University, there have been 16 million confirmed cases worldwide, with 644,000 deaths confirmed to be linked to the virus.
In the meantime, the mosquitoes will finally be able to enjoy themselves.
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavík there is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a grave.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the pavement is capable, and many are now stalling and admiring works of art from millions of mosaic tiles —as if they had never seen them before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least it didn’t look like it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, right in front there were parking lots that were always under siege.
People lay there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped off to do their business in the city center.
'Livable and diverse public spaces' and 'attractive urban spaces' are the guiding lights for the rebuilding of the current Safe Street.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow Maker Helgadóttir at Tollhúsen to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work will be a square and since the area is well located in the sun, it is considered well suited as a rest area for road users.
The artwork will be illuminated and the material will now enjoy itself better than before on this 142 square meter area.
There will also be small “nebulous sprayers” in the area, a type of water sculpture, which offer a play and give the area a certain mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by the city of Reykjavík, which is under construction together with Veitur.
Water, heat and electricity will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their ages, but the sewage and cold water treatments date back to 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the city center for almost a century.
When the gate is reopened after construction, cars can drive over it again.
But it will become a one-way street and at the same time create a quieter and more accessible space for pedestrians.
In a report on the Customs House on the website of the head of customs, it says that the house was put into service in 1971, but its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
As the harbour damage passed through the building, 250 square meters of windowless walls formed into a street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a surface would have a negative impact on the overall streetscape, if special measures were not taken to beautify the appearance of the building.
The parties had therefore agreed to calculate by having a permanent work of art set up there.
During this time, there was a lot of talk about Helgadóttir, an artist, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively in the art of mosaics in Germany and beyond.
The decision was to contact her first before deciding whether to compete for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the harbour, since the harbour had been living in Reykjavík since it was made.
When she was talking to the artist, she became obsessed with such a work.
She had to agree that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she returned from the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
She was given the time she needed to decide for herself, and when she returned home she made some suggestions for discussion.
She was promptly asked to do the work.
It was also requested to enter into a comprehensive contract with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, who had long worked with her as an installation of famous works of art throughout Europe.
The contracts were successful and Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur worked on the artwork under the installation of their brothers' workshop, who then took care of the installation of the Customs House.
All the work was exceptionally well done, both by Helgadadóttir and Oidtmannbr<0xC3><0xA6><0xC3><0xB0>ra, says the summary.
Since then, it has endured the unpleasant Icelandic weather.
It took him about two years to do the work, which was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the customs work was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to move more institutions to the country
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, the Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be exported to the country in the near future.
This is what the minister said in the episode Explosions on the Wave at noon.
Recently, it was announced that the Department of Housing and Civil Engineering will be moved north to Sau<0xC3><0xB0>árkrók this autumn.
Six experts in the field of firefighting work at the agency, but none of them intends to join the agency in the north, and the National Association of Firefighters and Medical Carriers has criticized the housing movements.
“I think we need to take a step further in this direction.
I’m preparing for another step in this direction.
Further transportation," said Asmundur.
He said he was convinced that the vast majority of the nation would like to see a greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
“I think it has to take further political decisions about the transfer of public works to the country, as I did with the Norwegian Housing and Civil Engineering Agency,” said <0xC3><0x81>smundur, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been transferred to the country and were of great importance for the communities abroad.
All the best from the second day of the championship
The Icelandic freestyle championship ended today at <0xC3><0x9E>órsvelli in Akureyri.
Several matches were held on the second day of the competition.
There was an exciting competition in the best ladies in <0xC3><0x9E>órsvelli, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH placed <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet in the best ladies’ list in 2014, which lasted until Elizabeth Rut Rúnarsdóttir from <0xC3><0x8D>R improved the rating in May last year.
Vigdís won the <0xC3><0x8D>slandsr<0xC3><0xA5>det back earlier this summer and has been in fantasy form lately, but she has tripled the <0xC3><0x8D>slandsr<0xC3><0xA5>det what is left of the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been suffering from injuries and has not been able to cope today.
She had only one golden shot of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt, and at the same time set a tournament record.
Her Icelandic record she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters and she was therefore somewhat from that.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from Ireland had the second best shot of the day, but she improved her best performance with a throw up to 50.18 meters.
Hilmar <0xC3><0x96>rn Jónsson, <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmethafi, won a safe victory in the men’s category, but he threw 73.84 metres in his next final throw and set a goal score.
His Icelandic record in the industry is 75.26 meters.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>ni Valur Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason, an Olympic skier and Icelandic record-breaker, won a competition in a ball throw at <0xC3><0x9E>órsv<0xC3><0xA6>ll yesterday, but today he competed in a circuit that is his main field.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>na Vals is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today, but he had one valid throw that was enough in 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>ardóttir, an Icelandic long-distance champion, won the long-distance race with a top score, while Hafdís jumped the longest 6.25 metres today, which is almost 40 cm from her Icelandic score.
In the 200-metre women’s race, the most successful was the Irishman Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg Jóna Bjarnadóttir, who scored 24.04 seconds while her Icelandic record in the field was 23.45 seconds.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri. She won two gold medals yesterday, in a 100 metre race and in a 4 x 100 metre bid race and then also in a 4 x 400 metre bid race today.
Kolbeinn Hö<0xC3><0xB0>ur Gunnarsson from FH scored the first goal in the 200 m race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of <0xC3><0x81>rmann’s <0xC3><0x81>rmann’s <0xC3><0x93>liver Mána Samuelsson.
Like Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg Jóna, Kolbeinn Hö<0xC3><0xB0>ur won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres race.
Don't get a fine for 27 million kroner bitcoin harvest
The IRS has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who claimed a fine on a man for underestimating his capital gains arising from the sale of the electric coin Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not provided clear reasons for the need to impose a fine on the person.
The committee’s ruling states that the tax investigator considered the person to have returned materially incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He had overstated his capital gains resulting from the sale of 27 million bitcoins, either intentionally or out of tremendous negligence.
I blame the man for his behavior.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
In 2016, he sold $27 million in electronics.
She would have been buried in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and cost-effective with a normal home computer.
He also pointed out that when he sold the electric coins, tax execution due to such a sale had been considerably unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been more reasonable to expect public citizens to be aware of such measures on tax returns.
He would not have avoided paying tax on the harvest and would have accounted for his asset on a statement as a deposit on a foreign exchange account.
He would have asked both the experts and the Treasurer about how this would be done but without success.
Then he thought he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules on which the tax authorities would not have formed a clear opinion.
The man therefore considered right that his taxes for these two income years would be re-established and the burden applied but otherwise no penalty would be imposed.
He said he worked in Iceland and had been paying taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He never intended to escape his duties in an improper way.
The demand for a fine would be out of proportion and would throw him into debt.
He said, “This guy knows what football is.”
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been a big part of the team, but he was also impressed by his performance in the Pepsi Max division.
The lights will be in the fire line tonight when they receive <0xC3><0x8D>A in live broadcast at Station 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes out a ban on playing because of four reminders during the season and therefore does not appear with a new haircut as in the summer games so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
"I don't know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was better at trying in the game.
He did not hide.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was anyone going to level this game then I thought he would do it or make it," said Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Benediktsson of the Pepsi Max team, when it was thought that Brynjólf.
“I’m here for the people.”
“Sometimes it’s hard to figure out what he’s in.
He looks a little to the left when it starts to feel at the games, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Haflidason.
<0xC3><0x9E>orkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólf is a real entertainer and is therefore pleased to have such a colorful person in the department: “No one is sharing that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to be always ready to meet and answer in interviews.
There’s an incredible amount of people busy with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“I am an entertainer.
I want to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynjolf, people are paying in and watching what happens next on his hair.
“This man is just a genius,” he said.
The player says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in contact with a few teams in the B division"
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in the Pepsi Max division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish medium Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to make the start of the season in his home country, but to do so he must first terminate his contract with KR, where the Danish league starts before that Icelandic chance.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias told Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few teams in the B division and will probably switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay off my contract with KR.”
He says he will probably have to pay a salary cut in Denmark.
“The Danish society has probably felt more of the economic impact of the virus than it did in Iceland.”
Bicycle rider Bjartmar has recovered a bike for millions - now responds for themselves after DV coverage
For over a year Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He picks up and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name "The Bike Rider" for the reason.
Yesterday there was so much confusion when you published a story of your relationship with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to a discussion on a Facebook group of Westerners where it was revealed that Bjartmar had taken the man on a speech in Austurvellir and said the scooter may have been stolen.
There was nothing else that could be read from the original writings of the electrician but that Bjartmar had stolen him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the case is not at all descriptive of what really happened yesterday in Easter Island.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victims of the electric scooters that these were really their electric scooters.
This information was given to a suspected owner by someone else, but the information was found to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“I looked at the guy and I recognized the shuttle, ending up with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and was searched.
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to drive on the shuttle, I decided to hit him and talk to him.
The owner was sure of his fault and so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally speaking, I do very well in such a case, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word from me.”
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
“Yeah,” said Bjartmar, “let’s just get this straight.”
Then the owner of the electric bus proved ownership of his electric bus and started driving.
Later, the rightful owner of the electrician told his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In this more than year that Bjartmar has devoted himself to this practice, he says he can count the intervals he encountered with people on one hand.
“I have had a peaceful relationship with the hardest people in Reykjavík,” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bike thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in the community, addicts, mentally deranged people and other people who are on the street for some reason.
“The addiction is a hard master and somehow the next dose needs to be funded, unfortunately theft of such loose money is an easy way to achieve that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My relationships with these people are really so good that I have brought a lot of the good people with me.
“Some people have gone to the hospital and looked after me and helped me with what I’m doing,” he said.
Generally speaking, Bjartmar's communication with cyclists is courteous.
Some know about him and what he is doing, and offer to show him receipts, bicycle numbers, and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has little been discussed.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police are even beginning to advise people to talk to him because of stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous news report DV and does not claim to be any kind of self-organized police in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he hasn’t yet been on the ice with his activity, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar certainly says.
“Of course the police are doing this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are simply not doing this.
I have to picture watching police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She’s just plain unhappy in these things.”
“When the police are not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this case, why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He says he has achieved so much success in having stolen wheels, that sometimes he encounters his "customers" on the street that they just have the right Bjartmar wheels they had previously gotten in.
The times Bjartmar has called for police assistance have caused her to simply not be present.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault and it’s not the owners of the bicycles’ fault,” said Bjartmar, regretting that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer for the emptiness of the police in this case.
The success of Bjartmar is not disputed.
You can find stories of people thanking Bjartmar for having brought their belongings back to them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long lost the number of bikes he has returned, but the amounts run on millions, if not millions.
Weigh there electric scooters, electric bikes and electric shuttles heavy, but electric bikes can cost upwards of half a million.
Bjartmar works every day in kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a community.
His bike search is therefore an unpaid job that he does in his free time.
Livelihoods and long shadows
2019 was a great anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had received a pension from the King of Denmark from all streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for officials was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all public employees.
The basis for the existing pension funds for general wage earners was then laid down by universal labour contracts in 1969, which provided for employment-related pension funds with mandatory membership and validated fundraising from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, such laws were enacted on the basis of these agreements and the pension system continued to strengthen thereafter.
The social security system of the wage earners was not the only drastic change that the 20th-century trade union movement brought about with its labor struggle.
Unemployment insurance had similarly been obtained in the history of strikes in 1955, and the organization gradually progressed its demands for sickness rights and sickness funds, significant holiday rights, shortening of working hours, improvements in housing matters and more.
All these rights cost a great deal of strenuous struggle, but proved, after all, to be a far greater and more lasting loss than the increase in the wage envelope, which disappeared as hard in the wake of inflation that characterized the post-war period until 1990, as many remember.
The approach to the establishment of a general pension fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although people would eventually agree that the funds would become the property of fund members, the trade union movement agreed that their boards should be appointed representatives of employers and fund members on an equal footing.
In the next few years after the foundation of the funds, the requirement for a majority of the workforce on the fund’s boards often came to discussion in employee organizations, but it never succeeded, and therefore we still have the abnormal arrangement that representatives of fund members are not in the majority of the fund’s boards.
Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on compulsory pension insurance and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It states in paragraph 1 that "the pension fund shall be guided by the interests of fund members."
It also states in paragraph 5: “The Pension Fund shall set itself a moral standard in investments.”
The Company’s shareholder policy includes, inter alia, the following provisions, in consequence of the aforementioned statutory provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations Principles on Responsible Investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the West Sea and Europe.
The rules discuss how focusing on environmental and societal issues as well as good governance of companies can contribute to the improvement of investment performance of stock exchanges.
This brings together the interests of investors and the objectives of society in a wider context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those listed on the stock market, adopt a public policy: to maintain good governance in terms of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The National Pension Fund (Vildi), which has the largest funds in the country, has established a “responsible investment policy” and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all reflected here as the entrance to the latest Icelandic fashion word, “shadow management”.
Since the word is new in the case, it is not hoped that it has been defined to a certain extent, but the following definition now seems to me to be "most taken": Shadow management is when a leader in a trade union says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the company to the board of the pension fund a recommendation or instructions on how they should be taken.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be expelled from the board at the earliest opportunity.
If the leader does not bring this to the media and does not talk about dismissal, it is not, however, "shadow management" since such communication between people is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I’ll let the reader think about the way he feels “shadow.”
In particular, two people have tried to formulate this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Hor<0xC3><0xB0>ur <0xC3><0x86>gisson, a journalist at the newspaper, and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir Jónsson, the governor of the central bank.
The reason for the two was that Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company’s agreements with airline crew members and airline attendants (suggesting them to be part of the company), and Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E>ór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Trade Unions Association, sent them a recommendation to the representatives of the company.
Some time later, Bogi retracted Nils’ decision, and Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E>ór went the same way with his recommendations, which were of course based on Boga’s decision.
Nonetheless, they saw Harder and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir a reason to plead the matter in the Friday Newspaper with big words about shadow management, violations of law and the rich need for changes to the law.
There, a small pigeon was indeed to roll a heavy helmet even though the blessed pigeon had been in a connection mode and had also been quickly wiped out.
As the matter is important, let us consider the matter itself at the end.
I’ve already mentioned some of the things in the law on pension funds that are related to this matter.
These include that fund management must take care of the interests of fund members and have ethical criteria in investments, and these issues are detailed in the statutes of both the Fund and the Life Insurance Fund of the merchants, as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT only look at short-term earnings plans in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous course and would not have to look long for examples in the past, as large loans from banks and funds have led to immoral adventurers and environmental waste, with disastrous consequences.
Icelandair’s CEO was clearly on the ice when he thought of drooping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the company’s favour in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw it and pulled it back.
Time shows whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be accountable to the fund companies when it is established.
The author is a former professor of physics and science history.
One of the victims did not return home.
One of the three people diagnosed with COVID-19 yesterday arrived in the country from the Baltic on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who does not reside here regularly and therefore did not receive clear instructions to maintain the so-called repatriation procedure after his arrival in the country and go for another sampling a few days after his arrival.
He got negative from screening at the border.
“But he’s in an Icelandic society and he’s actually going to go to that resort,” says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist in the field of antibiotics at Landl<0xC3><0xA6>g<0xC3><0xB0>ur and a deputy antibiotic surgeon while he’s on summer vacation, in a conversation with the newspaper today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the identification number and if the identification number is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the second sample."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually residing abroad, but because of his relationship with the country as an Icelander, he should have rather used it in Icelandic.
But he didn’t realize it.
“When the identification number is not registered, you need to apply for the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
“So it’s clear that we need to increase our information on this while we find some way to make an automated preaching system, even though Icelanders don’t record their identification number.
Or to make it somehow clearer who are the participants in Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the person gets around on arrival to the country, although he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, a remaining Icelander.
Only six have been sent to a quarry since he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They will be sampled, but two of them are showing signs of COVID-19.
The man received a negative result from his sampling at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says he was probably recently infected with the virus that she had not yet been able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
“It’s not entirely possible to say that this is definitely an imported infection because it’s been a long time since he came to the country that he may have been exposed here like these two who have caused a bit of steering in connection with the sporting events.”
It’s unlikely because of how few people are here.
“It’s really very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but notes that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the virus in man.
“If we get a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that he carried it to the country.”
Bombs and splashes against protesters
There was a clash between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
The police used the protesters pepper spray and immortal handguns, but the protesters broke the windows and turned on.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested throughout the United States last night, but the Seattle protests were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands of people gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then ignited a building site and broke the windows of the city’s courthouse.
The police said the protests were unsettled and there was a conflict between the protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police last August, was remembered by protesters.
A car ran through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of national guards gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police at her home in March.
The group was armed with firearms and walked into counties at closed intersections where police joined the group from a group of people who protested and also carried firearms.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r, Manchester United manager, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea does not lose to the Wolves, Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r and his men end up in 5th place and thus lose a Champions League seat.
However, they still hope to get into the Champions League by winning the European League next month.
“We haven’t arrived at the end.
If we get a point against Leicester, I think people will say we haven't had a bad season," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a considerable amount of land to catch the two teams above us," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
It's clear that people's nerves will blow at 3 p.m. today, but Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r tried to pretend that it was every other game.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is where the company is based.
We have prepared a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is ours to take advantage of it," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
“It’s not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The results don’t define our period, we’ve already had many moments defining this period.”
“The arrival of Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think that overall we are in a better shape and much stronger mentally than in the last season,” Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
65,000 infections per day
65.490 new coronavirus infections were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed from the West Sea since the start of the epidemic in the country.
More than 900 people died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days, more than 1,000 died from the virus per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to the U.S. Department of Health, the number of deaths due to the virus will be 175,000 on August 15.
Fear of the second wave of the epidemic
Spain’s government is trying to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19 on both Thursday and Friday.
No more have been detected in one day from the beginning of May and the news arrives at the same time as Spain begins to lift one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
As a result, the British authorities are now obliged to send passengers coming from Spain to a quarantine on their return.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is what is worse in Catalonia in the northeast of Spain, where the government has taken broader restrictions to try to slow down growth.
In the capital of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and tidal houses will be closed at midnight.
The curfew is now in effect for 200.000 inhabitants in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision of the UK will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly played after the epidemic.
Tui, the UK’s largest travel agency, cancelled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in resorting to a comprehensive curfew that has largely ruined the economy.
Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken this very seriously and compared it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
France’s Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the nation “would not survive, economically or socially,” if it were again resorted to a national ban.
Many advisers hope that local resorts that reach the residents of individual towns, cities or areas will be sufficient to keep the virus off in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three in Iceland
Three domestic infestations were detected yesterday, plus two additional infestations at the border.
Five people with positive COVID-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
One of the infections is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been confined and sixteen who were in close contact with him in sickness quarrels.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of a sports club in Reykjavík and, according to the announcement, is “only part of the sports team” in a health quorum.
Others who were sent to the quarry are connected to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unknown and smithing is in full operation at the smithing team of the state police chief.
The ReyCUP champions have complied with the guidelines and regulations of the GP and the public health service that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of the event last night attracted attention as they could be seen in very close association celebrating the good performance of their team on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, supporters posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
“ATH: Parents please respect the rules that competitors collect their own stuff at school.
Parents are not allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was diagnosed yesterday but is related to the infection reported yesterday.
“Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.”
A smearing is also being carried out in this case and the person infected is in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
It was discovered in the southwestern corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close contact with him in sickness quarry.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two were diagnosed at the border and are awaiting the conclusion of further research, such as a cross-border infection pathway.
Finally, the announcement says: The Department of Public Protection of the State Police Department and the Office of the National Doctor urge people to be careful and pay close attention to individual anti-infectious agents.
If there is the slightest doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to go for a sampling at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur says the campsite booked up for a shopping holiday - Directs guests to another
The camp site at Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur is fully booked this weekend, according to the announcement by Westbygg<0xC3><0xB0>ur.
Guests are advised to check out other accommodation options.
Names Westbygg<0xC3><0xB0> Bíldudal, Tálknafjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, Melanes on Red Sands, Hótel Flókalund and Hótel Brei<0xC3><0xB0>avík as other options in the location.
There is plenty to be on Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur this weekend, because, as in previous years, Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic documentaries, will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and therefore has become a strong tradition in the city.
From the assault on the camping site, for example, you can expect a good attendance this year, if the weather does not put a line in the account, but DV said earlier today of a secondary forecast.
We can expect the worst weather to the south, and hope for the Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur.
The website bb.is first mentioned, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
Fully-built apartment caves down in the best location in the city
Romanian workers live free of charge at Dunhaga 18–20.
In the meantime, owners are applying for a building permit for improvement, but their business has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjavík, a large multi-storey building stands on three floors.
On the ground floor of the building there is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house are doors with two stairways, each containing four rather spacious apartments.
They are in the range of 93-130 square meters, although most of them are over 100.
The house has a long history to keep.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted, among others, a video rental, the Skoloft, the milk shop of the Milk Store, Jóa Gunsmith, a fish store and most recently University Press.
The house, to put it mildly, has remembered its imbecile beauty.
The house is now under heavy damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are, according to the company register, Magnús Magnússon and Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús headed the Borgar property group and was a defender of the Borgar ownership company.
Among the owners of the holding company Borgunar is St<0xC3><0xA5>lskip ehf.
St<0xC3><0xA5>lskip ehf. is the investment company of Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún Helgu Lárusdóttir and her children.
Gudrún is also the owner of a third part of D18 ehf.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún and her husband, <0xC3><0x81>gúst Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>sson, once sailed the steel ship.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little or nothing been kept since then.
Neighbors say the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since then, but mostly in recent years.
On a Facebook page, one resident said the house was “not very lively for the past few years.”
The owners may have been looking for years to change the house and the land.
Other neighbors say the house hasn’t been okay for a long time.
“It’s long time it’s time to do something nice about this spot and it’s sad that it drew like this.”
He also said that he was angry with the owners of the house for not driving himself to finish this, finding someone in common with the neighbors of the house, and stopping this “legal bar”.
“Just do this in consultation with the community around you so that we can hurry up and finish it.”
The “physical step” referred to by the population is the planning process of the field that has been in operation since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were then asked for permission to build a floor on top of the existing multi-storey building and behind the building, a new lift house and an extension on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that implementation was appealed to the Committee on the Environment and Resource Judgments and the Committee repealed it as the implementation was not based on a divisional structure and a narrow notification was insufficient.
The City of Reykjavík then started with a divisional organizational work and completed it with an advertisement in the Official Journal in July last year.
That plan was also appealed and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, almost three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the building on the starting grounds.
At that time, the house had collapsed considerably and the neighbors began to tire.
When DV asked the neighbors about the situation and the reaction of the neighbors, the answers were in a number of ways.
Some knew the purpose of the house, others didn’t.
Others turned their anger to the city, others did not.
Others were angry, but not at all.
Others said the parking lot was a problem, but neighbors have used the unused Dunhaga 18–20 parking lot under their vehicles.
One of the defendants said he was tired of the administration:
“The fact that we have to go through the process three times is quite unbelievable.
It’s like the city of Reykjavik doesn’t know how to read.”
Today the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the city’s swift administration and the noble intentions of the owners and many years of their work that is now in its infancy.
When a journalist approached Dunhaga 18, a galloping door and a pile of rubbish blew at him.
Playstation computers and recent televisions lay within another rubbish on Earth —victims of Icelandic summer bleach.
It was opened in the old office of the University Press and there a lot of cats of the scent of the lake to judge.
It is clear that someone has been riding around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of geology pages, which were probably to become a book, flew by.
The ladders of the house were also open and life in both.
A reporter was lucky enough to meet one of them.
The Romanians were cooking a potato dish for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and imitate DV’s sources that the company paid nothing for the house except for heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not justified to charge the rent.
From the post office in the lobby of the building, it is clear that there have lived a lot of foreign workers in the last few failures.
Employee rental operations have not been partly affected by the COVID-19 situation, as the contraction of tourism led to a contraction in the construction industry and these two industries were the most efficient to make use of employee rental services.
Nonetheless, householders at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do, and the workplaces and cowboys in the community hung to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist said goodbye to the boys in Romanian, his irony suddenly became clear: In the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of real estate stands.
Owners want to change the house for improvement and neighbors want to improve the condition but discuss the definition of "improved".
In between the city’s planning area is the starting point, the victim of endless appeals and appeal possibilities in the planning process and the floating phase of the decision-making committee on environmental and resource issues.
In the house live so Romanian workers, perhaps even those who go to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article was originally published in DV on July 17.
In the fight against overweight following coronavirus age
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide <0xC2><0xA3>10 million in a campaign against obesity, which will include banning fast food advertising, following his severely ill condition, in part because of his weight.
Johnson is due to launch the campaign, called Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their customers in overweight and will also be tackled with increasing cycle paths.
Advertisements will be banned before 9 p.m., according to British media.
“COVID-19 has alerted us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use our time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier foods,” a government spokesman said.
Johnson himself has had a weight problem, but he was put into intensive care when he was infected by the coronavirus this spring, and it is partly because of his weight that he is thought to have become so seriously weak.
Women are better placed to make changes.
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation could take towards greater power distribution, transparency, and the fight against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to start changing gears a little bit now and who is better suited to bring about such change than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
“There are women,” Helga said.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s rights.
Standing together and being together to bring about change.
Now it’s time for us to make these changes.”
She said she was somewhat concerned about the emphasis on Iceland being the “best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not ready to see what we have to do.
As Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of peripheral groups.
"We don't all have the same rules," Helga said.
When asked, she said that women are in many respects in good health in Iceland, but added that, as in many other places, Icelanders live with extremely masculine values.
She said that politics turned to forming their own interests, domination and powers, which were the forces that maintained injustice in all societies.
“Women have now formed this group and come together and are just getting a little annoyed that Parliament is going to move on to look past this 2012 referendum,” she said.
“It’s the feminine values that we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and that we are all really sitting at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people here who live in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can divide differently," Helga said.
“It’s ridiculous that there is a natural law that women’s jobs are always paid lower.
It’s ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to stand in endless labor struggles just to get a decent wage.”
The signing list for the new constitution can be signed here via electronic Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after he threatened a pedestrian and tried to make money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in <0xC3><0x81>rb<0xC3><0xA6>r where two were arrested for the case.
The police then stopped the driver of a motorcycle in Hil<0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0>ar where his driver was at a speed of 146 km with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn over the night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise because of the noise.
On Saturday night, reports of eleven noisy gatherings were received and it was widely viewed in the police diary.
Last night, however, there were 22 noisy voices on board the police.
Six were held in a prison cell last night.
Police were called to town last night when firefighters fired in the air.
However, they had already escaped when police officers came to the park.
Nine drivers were arrested for drinking and driving drugs.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city centre last night, but one of them was kept in a prison cell.
Then two were transferred to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in the West Town.
One was transferred to an accident unit after he was injured by jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who pulled a caravan at Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to the police’s diary, the bicycle equipment of the caravan was in “very bad condition” and was stationary.
You can stay in Monet's house for the weekend
The house in which Claude Monet spent the last 40 years of his life is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next free nights in the house are about the shopping weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The world-renowned painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If you want to rent a house, you must rent it for at least two nights.
Based on the Airbnb site, it’s almost available after a week, on Sunday of the weekend, so it might be ideal for some shoppers on vacation to hurry to book the painter’s house.
The two nights over a shopping weekend cost no more than 964 U.S. dollars or just over 130 thousand Icelandic kroner as the next time the newspaper gets there.
Dozens in quarantine and some of them begin to show symptoms of the disease caused by coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unconnected.
Dozens have been infected for this reason, and some of them are beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus inland yesterday and two with border screening.
A specialist at the office of a national doctor says that a growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in society.
“There’s been a sequence from the first domestic infection and it’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been concealed in society for some time.
This is probably something that has recently arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigri<0xC3><0xB0>ur Josefsdóttir, specialist in the field of fetal protection at the national doctor's office.
Most of them have been associated with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling is taking place in the near future, but some who were in contact with the infected have begun to show signs of the coronavirus.
“Now the flu is not going on and less about other respiratory infections so we can be fairly free to do these tests on individuals who at the time of the flu would have found a reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Infection is mostly complete, but it is not impossible that more people will have to go to a sick quarry.
Two of the victims were diagnosed after attending a sports event.
Have you ever wondered if there is any justification for such an event?
The Public Relations Officer says it well slowly as long as people follow the rules and standards.
Kamilla says almost exclusively that the infected have been infected at the sporting events.
“If there is no more isolation from these individuals after having attended these sporting events, then we can say that our diseases at the events have worked.
But it has not been revealed," said Kamilla.
The practice of the Department of Public Protection is under constant review.
"We need to be prepared to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems to be justified," Kamilla said.
In less than a week, the limits will be extended to a thousand people.
This new position could affect the sedation.
"Definite meditation to cook" - See Elisa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>ar's menu
Elisa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>arsdóttir is an accomplished female football player and plays with Val.
She is also a master in nutrition, mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the last day and usually gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My usual day starts with coming to work from eight," says Elisa.
“After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl in kindergarten at three o’clock.”
Elisa feels very nourished to bring her daughter to kindergarten early.
“It’s nice to have time with her before I go to practice.
After workout, it’s good to come home and just have to warm up your food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one part to empty our minds.”
Elisa does not follow any particular diet.
She is finalizing her master’s thesis in nutrition, so she knows what she needs to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercise.
“What suits me is eating a variety of foods that are well-composed of protein, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I find it most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food as bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.”
Elisa is very interested in cooking.
“I feel a certain amount of meditation when I stand in the kitchen cooking and I get a lot of it.
I have to say that my self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I truly believe that I am a good cook.”
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
Take this meal with what is available.
Usually it is banana and bounced mushroom & coffee.
I'm a big coffeemaker.
Intermediate: Incredibly different, but fruits or vegetables, flat cakes, clean skirts with banana and mushroom, bread with spread and so I could eat hummus with a spoon up from a box if so applicable.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of delicious salads from what’s in the fridge, cinema or barley, falafel bowls, rock salad, oven-baked vegetables with good dressing is something I’m working with.
If the organization goes completely out of control (which often happens) then the egg machine at work has saved me quite often and then it's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, don't put more on you.
Intermediate: Get me something rich in carbohydrates for exercise, bread with spreads, cereals or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often for the choice in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Controversy between police and protesters in Seattle
The city of Seattle, Washington, has declared a state of insurrection following a mass protest in the city centre.
Yesterday, police used explosives and pepper sprays to try to clear a large area occupied by the protesters and stretched over several blocks of houses in the vicinity of the parliamentary building in the city.
Police said on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into the damage done at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some sort of bomb.
Civil and police authorities say that protesters stoned police with stones, bottles, bombs and other debris and one police officer was taken to a hospital where he was injured.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They were blown to demonstrate protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there has been repeatedly a fierce conflict between protesters and heavily armed federal agents.
There, like in many cities in the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, Georges Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protests against systematic racism in American society and demands correction.
Not revoked until after voting
It is not yet clear whether the cancellations of Icelandair’s flight attendants, which are due to take effect in the coming month, will be revoked.
The electronic vote on Icelandair’s board member agreement on behalf of Icelandair will end tomorrow at noon.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairman of the company, says that Icelandair will not make a decision on the cancellations until the outcome of the vote is available.
"It's a good thing," said Gudl<0xC3><0xA5>ug L<0xC3><0xA6>ney.
“There have been no cancellations, this must be done so that the machines can be manned.
“People are very impatient to know if they’ll be able to get a job after the monthly meeting.”
The vote is for a contract signed a week ago, on the eve of July 19th.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that the flight attendants had previously submitted to a vote.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Board of Trustees of Icelandair Board of Directors agreed to announce an all-round stop at Icelandair, and members voted to do so.
It never came to pass, but this was decided following the decision of Icelandair to discontinue negotiations with the Icelandair Airline, terminate all its airline crew members and look for contracts with another trade union company.
Then the company’s pilots were to take on the jobs of security personnel on board temporarily.
Asked how she feels that the vote will go, Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug Líney says difficult to say about it.
“People are in pain after this action of Icelandair, when all flight attendants of the company were dismissed and announced that a deal would be concluded with another union.
“It’s going to have an impact now,” she says.
940 flight attendants were employed by Icelandair at the end of April, but 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their resignation period is varied, with those who have the shortest working life being three months, and therefore ends about the month of July-August.
About 90% of Icelandair’s air carriers are in this group.
What does the contract not accept?
“We want to continue our conversations with our colleagues.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants think they have gone too far.”
Vote on collective bargaining concludes and Icelandair announces second quarter settlement tomorrow
The airline's vote on a new collective bargaining agreement will end at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair’s second quarter settlement will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary management results indicate that the company’s revenues have decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting on the collective agreement between Icelandair and the Association of Icelandic Flyers for Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 noon.
Icelandair employees are eligible to vote in the contract and pay social security contributions to Icelandair.
Icelandair and FF<0xC3><0x8D> signed a new collective bargaining agreement in the evening of Sunday 19 July, but on Friday before, Icelandair had terminated negotiations with the company after airline crews had voted on a previous agreement at the beginning of July.
Icelandair had then dismissed all flight attendants and flight crew members on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective bargain was signed.
According to the new collective bargaining agreement, flight attendants need to fly five more hours a month for the same basic salary.
The Kjaras agreement is valid until the year 2025, which integrates the provisions of the pilots and flight attendants on how long they can fly on a single shift.
The agreement was presented to members of the FF<0xC3><0x8D> at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and described many flight attendants with whom a news agency spoke about dissatisfaction with the agreement.
However, most seemed to agree that it would have to accept the agreement to keep the FFI alive.
Icelandair’s settlement for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but EBIT of the company, its operating income for capital items and taxes, is negative, according to provisional control findings, of 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars or about 15 billion ISK.
Icelandair sent the preliminary calculations to the Stock Exchange last Wednesday, saying that the company’s revenues amounted to about $60 million per quarter, or about ISK 8.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, cash and equity amounted to about US$154 million, around US$21 billion.
Icelandair also plans to offer the company’s share capital in August.
Icelandair aims to conclude agreements with fifteen lenders, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before entering a share tender.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“The new virus just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been maddening here in Norway," says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at the Infectious Diseases Department of the National Hospital, about the news that "a new type of virus" has been detected here in Iceland.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the social work of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection remains unexplored and a smear is ongoing.
A person who arrived in the country on July 15 was also diagnosed with COVID-19.
Yesterday an infection related to an infection reported yesterday was diagnosed, and after a sequential analysis of the Icelandic genetic analysis, a “new type of virus that has not been detected here before” was detected.
Infection is completed in connection with that infection.
M<0xC3><0xA5>r notes that this is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread around the world, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it meant and if it could say anything about the second wave of an epidemic has begun, Már says that as there is a single case in question and it could happen so that there is nothing more to it.
"But if there are any domestic cases that are not related from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then that conclusion [of the second wave] could be drawn, but it is premature that so came," explains Már.
Good luck in the hot tub.
Is the secret to the happiness of Icelanders hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC’s programmers lead to the body in a fun video that sheds light on the country’s swimming pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is unique worldwide and it is claimed that nowhere in the world there are as many bathing places per person.
The natural geothermal heat is the basis of this, but also the tradition for swimming that prevails here.
Children's health education was legalized in 1940, but older citizens are not less eager to use the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as an integral part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
Free of mobile phones, people talk together on personal notes about home and space or enjoy the benevolent power of water: contemplating and charging batteries of soul and body.
On the hill to pick up a hundred days in elections
There are 100 days until the U.S. elects a president for four years.
Donald Trump seeks re-election, but he has to go.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s future candidate, has a big advantage over Trump nationally, according to polls.
According to a recent survey by the AP news agency, the record number of Americans believes that the nation is on the wrong path.
Trump’s response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also highly unpopular, and more Americans than ever think the president has been poor on economic issues.
More specifically, only two in ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump’s response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he’s been good on economic issues.
In March, it was 56 percent and in January, it was 67 percent.
According to an average FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent nationally, while Trump is 41.9 percent nationally.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his performance against the epidemic to Biden, pushing for so-called cultural disputes and proclaiming policies that are supposed to be law and order.
Biden’s bid, however, is striving hard to keep Trump in the spotlight and considers there is a high chance of winning if the election is really about how Trump has been doing in the last four years.
Trump’s unpopularity also seems to be aiming to bring down Republican MPs, fearing Democrats might even reach a majority in the U.S. Senate, which has so far been very talented.
Politico said on the day that the succession of parties and candidates would remain the same as it is now, the Republican Party would have its greatest breakdown in decades.
The outskirts have proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now there is an expectation that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has been trying to scare suburban residents into following him, including by saying that if Biden becomes President, he will tear down the U.S. suburbs and push for racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House designed to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He then urged “mothers” from the U.S. suburbs to read an article by former Assistant Secretary of State in New York, where she argued that Biden would destroy the U.S. suburbs and endorsed Trump.
“This will devastate your neighborhoods and your American dreams.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!” said the president.
The population of the United States is an ever-expanding group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become President.
In 2012, Mitt Romney won the majority of the vote but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that despite Trump’s narrow majority in the suburbs in 2016, his followers there have dwindled significantly.
Although it differs between surveys, Biden has recommended a 15-percent advantage over Trump in the outskirts recently.

Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the corridors?
After the final decision was made to postpone the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have waged up to now, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Fire would be "the light at the end of the corridors," and referred to it as a global phenomenon.
The Japanese government has an additional year to prepare for the delay, and the authorities in Japan have to pay for the delay.
Everyone has a lot of heads in their heads.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue of the Olympic Games this year, the joy of Japanese representatives was genuine.
They cried and laughed in turn, as Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 Games, but it fell to the lower tie for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to bathe themselves in the world’s attention.
The games were scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed for a year, starting on July 23, 2021 and ending on August 8.
If you do not manage to keep the games then, if the coronavirus is still too much threat, the games will be discontinued.
No one wants to think about it until the end.
Olympics are not a normal sporting event.
There is nothing to be spared, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last play.
The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation of the city promotions by the selection committee.
The more magnificent the presentation is —the more likely it is to get a bump.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympics, or more than $20 billion.
The second time, when the 2020 Games were enrolled, $75 million, about $10 billion, was put into the promotion.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent $30 billion on the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean, given the cost of building an Olympic village, stadium and, in general, strengthening the country’s infrastructure to handle such tournaments, prepare them and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which should have been going on these days but have been postponed for one year because of the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by Japan’s State Auditor released at the end of last year found that the cost was closer to double that figure.
The cost of postponing the games will probably not be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run in the range of $15 to $30 billion.
The figures are so high that all the Icelandic government’s tax revenues were only close to half the Olympics, at the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are an event of the magnitude that they have tended to become a subject of discussion by economists, who try to review in numbers and view the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the shortest sense, many seem to have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympic Games are less than so positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
There are some short-term effects, for example, a very large number of jobs for a short period of time, but over the long term, cities tend to be burdened with debt debt and the threatening operating costs of low-used structures.
Rio in Brazil is in serious debt due to the 2016 Games and has been in trouble with costing the maintenance of all the major sports facilities built before the Games.
The 2012 London Olympics have been reviewed in figures, but it has been found that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
This means that we are not talking about new jobs, except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not been particularly fortunate to host the Olympics financially because of the sliding costs associated with the structures built for the Games.
However, the benefit is often thought to be in the increased traffic of tourists wishing to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which is, however, highly uncertain about the 2021 Games.
It’s also unclear if you’ll be able to take in all the crowds that usually download the games.
The main issue, however, is the honor that the cities are given to be elected, but it is difficult to estimate the amount of money.
Therefore, despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not in the nature of being able to put on it price tags.
But although the show is usually great and there is no savings, of course it is not just about money.
It’s the sports heroes that are in the foreground.
For some people, it’s a surprise to just postpone the games.
For example, Australian five-pointer and gold medalist Chloe Esposito, in her recent Olympics article, is a casolet and would have been far from good fun this summer, but hopes to be in a competition form for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather pleased with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to quit after the games this year, if they had been held on time, the postponement of the games in some cases means that they quit the competition before the games take place.
Rely on your body simply not to go through years of additional rigorous workouts.
Few athletes felt as well in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has appeared in several interviews in his home country recently to discuss the Olympic Games.
She plans to go to the Games in 2021, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of the games next year, as she will be 24 years old.
Although it is not generally considered high age, it is in a higher order for a gymnast in the leading order.
“This is a delicate matter,” Biles said, but smiled at another interview posted on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page asking if she was going to go as far in the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
“I just don’t know if I’ll be at the top after a whole year of training,” Biles says.
She has previously said that her body does not tolerate the stress that comes with gymnastics training much longer.
However, she is still practicing for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop exercising suddenly when the pandemic was at its peak and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form is certainly a bit better than most people.
“We have a tough plan now.
It was hard to start practicing again after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we’re back to full swing and I’m going to continue to increase my workouts as the year goes by.
Of course, we don’t know exactly how these games will be or if they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, can’t do otherwise.
I’ve put too much effort into leaving the sport now,” Biles says.
With it, like many others, the doubt or perhaps rather the awareness that the situation may come up that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
Predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games given that they will be held for a year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid walks.
Wedding delayed due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was scheduled to marry former Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about right now,” the actress told People.
“We really want to get married sometime and have the dream wedding and have all those present who are dear to us.
But we decided to put it off and focus on what’s important right now and that’s helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I’m looking more at the world than at weddings these days.
There’s a lot going on and we need to focus on what’s going on in the world.”
