Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, totaling 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous large coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought after the first preliminary results the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People’s Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly harsh losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the brink.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Carinthian state chief Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but compared to the last elections in 2006, it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse was the <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially in the People’s Party, which had demanded the early elections, this is a really disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP had left the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear advantage over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
The voters, however, have probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party’s chairmanship.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the large coalition of SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FP<0xC3><0x96>) received 18 percent for the time being, the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fear that the year 1999 could repeat itself, when the People's Party had agreements with the populists (then the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still unified in terms of a European government, in 2005 it split from the BZ<0xC3><0x96>)
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party, is obviously relying on this development and assumes a return to Vienna in Austrian federal politics.
The party of the Greens also entered parliament, but suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the 4% barrier and, as a result, did not move into parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India of illegally collecting beetles fails to be resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that Czech-Indian relations could be somewhat cooled down.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this doesn't clear up, then sure, then there will be some cooling down," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that the executive can hardly intervene in court matters.
Nevertheless, he stated that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was acquitted by the prosecution and received a fine, the central government wants to work with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," the minister said.
According to Mukherdshi, for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could thus request release on bail and wait in freedom for his verdict, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to provide the convicted person with “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such help was already being offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he reaffirmed, according to the Czech press agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK, before his partner, that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to detain and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister evaded an answer to the question whether he had been promised by the Indian side to deal with the matter.
“I’ve already been promised a lot,” he simply stated.
A Czech judges the struggle for the seabed
It approaches an electronic map that depicts Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the UN Oceans and Sea Rights Division’s 30-strong team.
His chief, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, pursues the interpretation and supplements it to and from.
There is work eagerness and enthusiasm here.
The seabed holds a little known world that is rich in natural springs.
Here you can find petroleum, ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The neighbouring states today vehemently notified their claim to the new sea areas.
According to a UN convention, they are exercising their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers far from the shores of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
To put it simply, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent beneath the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the lake, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
An international echo recently came upon Australia’s success, which became the first country to significantly expand its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed granted to the country last week by the Commission is about 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e. about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profits that will come to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also be gradually submitting their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, which the convention calls the "common heritage of humanity".
In this case, no state has a special position.
The right to promote in this field is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not a gold miner's land," said Mikulka, adding that "single territories are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the Convention, like the investors of a few other states, granted it the status of a so-called "pioneering investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is structured there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"It can be funded on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the legendary schem that brought the golem to life.
German Special Forces were on the scene of hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special forces were ready, but they did not come to use.
The circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are getting more and more details known.
German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
According to this, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the aviation squadron of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Relief Office were at the place of liberation.
However, as spokesmen of the ministries continued on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers ran their prisoners and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to involve it as a support force on the ground.
"Thankfully, that has not happened," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
Attackers had kidnapped the group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After being kidnapped in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been dragged back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until the end, as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there was initially no information about when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has barely failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
By 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the government’s bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals from U.S. President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called for MPs to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the state bailout could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, then, after becoming aware of the failure, crashed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers are seeing rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic outlook, the Germans’ travel appetite remains undisturbed, according to a study.
For bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the previous year's period, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, booking numbers have already increased for the autumn months.
For example, the sales growth of travel agencies for October was around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
These results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates them for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the US is particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the booking growth amounts to around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local regions, are particularly sought after by the Germans.
In particular, holiday packages are high on the agenda, DRV President Klaus Laepple explained.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs are "more calculable for the customer than for individually organised holidays".
Consumers could save money by, among other things, early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that sales will again increase compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liter jars and celebrities in designer dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is blonde, television presenter and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes on the Wiesn, already the photographers rush on us and snap the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to be fulfilling its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the white sausage equator, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited to date.
But once on the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or Lederhosn; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reap my dirndl apron.
A Münchnerin draws my attention to the fact that I had tied the apron wrongly: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, back widowed."
I secretly fry the loop from the back to the left.
"Fits," he said, laughing.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats that read "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch the naked butt towards an uninvited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an elongated "ooooo".
He tells me that after he gets rid of his previously drunken measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks he's a trash can.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wildbiesers".
Others are not fortunate enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, paramedics walk over the festival square in crowds, who have to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always perform in the pack - always four at a time tow a covered carry from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty, full back.
Who lies in the permille coffin under the tarpaulin, you can't see.
"These are the ones that goarnimmer pack," one of the paramedics called to me on request and disappeared in the tumult.
Name of the victim announced by police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was revealed.
Carole Paulson, who lives on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inside Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial aspiration.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides tell you.
The building sits riding at the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German Town Hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is about to collapse.
But once you are inside the vaulted ticket counter, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project whose westernmost access it was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late thief in the imperialist game, had to implement before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist plans paralysed during the First World War.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces emerged from Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely ignored from history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it, highlighting the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tukei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighboring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approximation.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the key elements of this new foreign policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same old-world footsteps in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city for the new secular state project of turning its back on the Ottoman past.
The AKP, however, which is known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has sparked some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a custom-made, ultra-modern stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There would be no one or the other.
She would have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could at some point," I asked, "be forced to make a decision?"
“Turkey,” he said, “wouldn’t have to face this decision.”
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone with whom I spoke here almost routinely abandoned: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, can, in a figurative sense, Europe as a whole on those same railroad tracks head east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha’s station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited at the jetty for the ferry that was going to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called “the sick man of Europe” in those days.
At that time, at least, there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Dead" Handley (officially on September 11th) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already in the late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting and existed only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never faded for years.
How often did death keep us from “letting the music speak for itself.”
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never dominant but never exuberant.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the last 40 years or so, I’ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by a single one – often I was inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He detested conductors who, according to his words, simply "went to house with one or two well-known shovel horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He spent 1950-1951 in the United States in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
<0x60>I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino <0x60>Flamenco and Life', because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and the power they exude, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments."
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda begins marketing the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor had a large interior, this spacious sedan offers a much larger one.
In addition, the technical subtleties that allow even more comfortable driving and saving gasoline.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar lineage to its predecessor, the changes that have been made to this grand limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
Still, before you start analyzing the new model, it has to be said that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation was released on the market.
According to the first observations, compared to the other manufacturers, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon as far as its sales in the other markets are concerned.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where the Jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the release of Jazz on the market, around one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, which is 17% of the growth assumed in the European market.
In terms of the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models, representing 6.7% of the total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
More specifically, the release of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the drop in sales in Spain.
In reality, the heads of the brand hope to conclude the year with total sales of 22,000 models. That is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this growth in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% year-on-year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda is relying on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models per year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed across the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, and for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new room flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It should be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4-litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the boot of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional features such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The second-generation Jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first 1.2-litre variant achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min?1.
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp on the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
"Auto-bee" that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is based on the swarm behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from Nissan Motor Co.’s technical development center developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan Safety Shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped aerospace, which is very similar to the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee, which can see at an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly undisturbed in its personal airspace without interruption.
To replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles that are up to two meters away from the BR23C and are in a 180 degree radius, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is translated directly into signal to avoid collision.
At the moment when an obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at 90o or even greater angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other arbitrary systems is that this evasive maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it were not, the robot might not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the senior engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate either upwards or downwards, but also not overhead; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways, as the bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, Nissan has used the rotation function so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and act accordingly.
It does not require the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers carried out to be stored, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for immediate collision prevention, a technology Nissan predicts to introduce to production cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to guide to the destination while driving, while avoiding the obstacles on the way.
She is shaking before being charged with a mortgage.
One has to realize that the U.S. Treasury, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the US citizens getting involved in the mortgage stories of the supposedly payable banks, a fun and informative game was developed for internet surfers: Bad Credit Hotel.
Or maybe the “hotel of bad credit” or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, two and up to three times if it is the time to ask for no credit.
And most importantly, where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a side for the teenagers than a place for all the spectators.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion and take over 21% of its capital, an innovation attributable to a sharp fall in its stock market price.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley stock at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The assumed price is below 19% of the price of the share as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit and will be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be done on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, which is 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley share fell by 6.79% to $23.07 at 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to holding bank status,” said John Mack, director-general of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which should allow it to expand its operations to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the deal has changed over the last few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Tokyo’s Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, said, “we thought that the stake would be made up entirely of ordinary shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and hedge ourselves.”
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay their Morgan Stanley shares 7% below their price value.
And the business will go with a reduction in profits by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares in one year if the latter are exchanged within a given period to more than 50% above the value of the sale, i.e. to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
However, a spokesman for the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to post a payability ratio of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan said that his balance sheet had been “definitely lowered” since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which had to watch as their stock market price fell by half, while the price of insolvency insurance rose rapidly.
This price went down on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Re-establishing the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorialist Rafael Correa.
It was that third party who, following the example of his like-minded and friends, presented this Sunday the plan for a new constitution.
According to the public results of 80% of the voters, 64% voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballots were invalid, and 0.7% were left empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be approved, one vote must be obtained more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for “yes,” predicting it from 63% to 70%.
In the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had, by the way, called for the victory of his constitutional project.
The “Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held silently in accordance with the OAS Observation Delegation, referred to a 444-point text to secure the “new socialism” for which the president is advocating.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to “development planning” in a country that lives largely from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange that sends immigrants to the country.
The project, driven by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the head of state more extensive power, who will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Ultimately, it also intends to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Equatorial base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad.
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital healthy and unharmed this Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the al-Maza military base right next to the Cairo International Airport at about 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy “best health” and the kidnappers “were not paid a ransom,” Egypt’s tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said on the runway.
After being captured at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya on September 19, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place by 35 unknown kidnappers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, from aboard two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
"Shots were fired on both sides and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," he said.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he is currently, on the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence and special forces," he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a patrol vehicle in which the kidnappers were found, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and detaining two.
The army stated that they were connected to a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which it immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and is a central topic of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical sites that starve miserably?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and culturally significant buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government allocates <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.5 million solely for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
It is written in the constitution of our American neighbors that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all MPs and all districts of government, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers assembled in 211 history societies endeavour to intensively deal with history, save with a few dollars the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers onto our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalized parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries want to help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis Bank, which is in turmoil due to the US financial crisis: The three countries make a total of EUR 11.2 billion available to the banking and insurance institute, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed this weekend at the highest level, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission’s Commissioner for Competition.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions now taken in connection with the bank could have precedent.
In line with the decision made on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell some of its holdings, most notably the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis started a steep descent last week, with serious crisis scenarios already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too big for a bankruptcy.
The Institute’s securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has declined by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the Group’s market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic, according to management.
According to management, the $700 billion US bailout and the resulting market uncertainty is to blame for the downturn in Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the prices increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the Bank’s new Director-General.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it has not found any interested person with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fox in the chicken coop
Due to a person’s drug use, in America life and health insurance often refuses to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the fox to the chickens" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance companies determine the fees and payment amounts in the event of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and should the risk be assessed too high, the insurance is not taken out at all.
In the past, the customer was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the examination results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: based on the identification number of the customer, he obtained the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, i.e., which preparations were purchased, and the program calculated from what disease the customer suffers and what his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat levels are untreatablely high, which would automatically place him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as for migraines and hot flashes, but also for depression.
From the point of view of insurers, the latter is a high-risk factor, while those mentioned before do not.
For the query and processing of the data, separate companies have been formed, which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and link them to data on drug use, providing an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
The bill had already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned may hardly be able to prohibit access to his data, since the insurance companies do not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left to the fox's mercy.
Global menu from Marseille
The European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main topic among other global issues at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit is also taking place, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given more voices and voices in international matters, the member states have not yet been able to agree on whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit yesterday in Marseille.
French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement has been reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to just over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion.
In view of the fact that between 2000 and 2007, exchanges of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this target is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into one agreement, so that air transport will also be boosted in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India’s number one partner, New Delhi ranks only nineth among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, as well as the call for a UN conference.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, which means that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as did the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and cut greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the issue of the financial crisis.
The Indian leader is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped that French firms will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the agency reports, the agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for rights acquisition.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is attending the current event with over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will be spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honorary guest of the event.
The subsecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities, Maria Giro, will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 square metre exhibition room "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is decreasing throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's small plane disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett's small plane, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a 3000-metre high plateau, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the aircraft.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully dispelled the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, whereupon a troop was dispatched. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane Steve Fossett was flying with on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (Ntsb) announced that just hours after the plane was sighted, a crew was dispatched to identify the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett took off in Yerington, Nevada on a 3-hour flight.
Yesterday, some of Fossett’s personal belongings were finally found in California, near the border with Nevada, by a couple near their home on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two identification cards called Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, in his sixth run, he became the first person to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover on an airplane.
Among his several records also includes an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don’t expect
A SUV that falls out of the conventional schemes by its original design and special lines, the sloping surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector with this off-roader.
Especially because of its extraordinary characteristics, the presentation of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, to be carried out in various phases, which will take up the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will seemingly emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
The new Glk is then illuminated at different moments in all its details using the Elumina8 technology to reassemble on it as a whole.
Without a doubt, Mercedes’s concern is to introduce a new kind of car advertising in this rather stereotypical field with this advertisement.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
There have never been any clashes with opponents.
The origin of the group lies in the right-wing environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia joined these groups in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: these, however, were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Her role models are English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had made 144 cards available to the Italian fans for the game: all were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia, no one was subject to an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-loaded in this regard, were thus also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified in the riots Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Thankfully.
But now, of course, there is a fear of impersonators, who could follow them a little more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and that in no way gives such behavior the opportunity for justification," the Viminal said.
Therefore, "Eye on especially also looking at the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small nucleus of Italian ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (sports supervisor) will gather on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the intelligence services, which deals with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed clearly in no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police chief of Trieste, where a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, comes from.
While it is true, Mazzilli says, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, no doubt the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist – adds the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are punished in the country of their deeds.
Until now, this group had been restrained, but now it is necessary to reconsider what has happened and will happen.
But let us also speak of the whistles during the Mamelis hymn: this is not a crime, but allow me, because there is no education.
