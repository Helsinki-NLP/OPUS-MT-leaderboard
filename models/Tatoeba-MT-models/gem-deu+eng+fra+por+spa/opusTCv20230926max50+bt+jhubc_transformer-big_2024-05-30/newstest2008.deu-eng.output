Food Debt to European Inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, the inflation rate was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the Leitzins. In its discretion, the rate cut would favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment to create an inflationary spiral.
The ECB aims to keep the inflation rate below 2%, or at least close to the 2% mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in doubt: inflation must be "agreed" to rule out the need for action later.
With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record high in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Responsible for the rise in inflation in the eurozone are the rise in food and energy prices.
MATIF wheat quotations rose 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in the price of edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3% inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup's government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably by the beginning of December, with the party having the largest base camp for the first time since 2002, while, according to Gallup, the approval for the Socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
The difference is clear among the party loyal voters thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: More than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) of the MSZP’s approval.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry barrier: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters in both camps has grown by one percent.
Compared to the last low, the general economic sentiment has deteriorated further -- never before has the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation to be "extremely bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it to be "relatively bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth expects improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December found that 71% of respondents — a historic high — rated the Prime Minister’s work as “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have high confidence or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán accounts for 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% distrust the head of Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of those who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be addressed even without a change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, 35% had voted in favour of the government and the head of government, this proportion today amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
When asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty", and another 20 percent would vote "probably".
In comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would "certainly" go to the polls, and another 15 percent would consider their participation "probable". Given these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital day allowance.
Turning to the group of those who participated in the referendum "with certainty", the shares of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, and 89 percent, respectively.
Auchan most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area have again this year maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trading triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over HUF 1,000 have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets "galopped" last December, the inflation rate has not been drastic in percentage terms, compared to the already high, earlier baseline level.
However, it is certainly deterrent to consumers that what they had paid for last year is not even available for HUF 10,000 this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the surveyed markets.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800, the price was HUF 6,800.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the same level as last year, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of breadwaves for 139 forints.
There was no competitive fall in the price of the product to less than 200 forints.
Also surprising was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 forints, so the drink, including the deposit, cost only HUF 257.
Nevertheless, this year's "Napi" shopping cart comparison saw Auchan the most expensive, and Cora the most favorable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's prices in the "Napi" basket compared to last year's Christmas prices have increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 forint, but the VAT increase in prices last Christmas was noticeable.
It is precisely this process that hit the trade: it seems that the department stores were not quite able to decide which price range to apply to the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were unforeseeable.
(If the retailer badly plans a product’s speed of circulation, it can fall by substantial gains in the price range that depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the cost of the "Napi" basket was so radical last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forints, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 forints more than the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, with the price of daily consumables in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office observed an increase of more than 30% over the 12-month period.
In addition to flour, there are also eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the already in the previous year expensive product has risen by little more than 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to revolve the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is continuously reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices at all.
Large quantities of everything are purchased, durable foods go into pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning there were endless queues at the cash desk in all three department stores, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country is reporting a lower customer frequency, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only in food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overloading of staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to curbing infections, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of János hospital, an MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection.
The injured person in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation could not be performed since then because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
Until December 10 of this year, 1094 infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported from hospitals to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their nose without it causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are dosed too high or applied improperly, the well-responsive bacteria develop antibiotic-resistant, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently malfunctioning immune system, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday hospital life.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA just does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - according to Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are examined for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rarely
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals would be preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for curbing the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and retirement homes, hospitals should examine the hospitalized patients and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
However, in Hungarian hospitals microbiological sampling is not practiced as often.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the state health insurance for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the Epidemiology Center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the agent can develop, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals either.
Among outpatients, or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling is even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Savings on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted from one patient to another by nursing staff.
It is precisely for this reason that washing hands, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the home hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient.
The rooms are even often crowded, the beds tightly lined together, although from an epidemiological point of view, there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the less well-off hospitals, there are even savings in disinfectants, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that directly favor the development of infections.
Such infections are shown to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs to health insurance companies, so they are being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government program.
After the first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has identified the prevention of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Police chief was not drunk.
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The now resigned police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest prosecutor's office on Friday, after the official opinion on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before driving.
The former police chief drove his own car into Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district, driving over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked location.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, subordinate .)
The pedestrian succumbed to his injuries after being hospitalized.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then dropped his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest prosecutor's office has opened its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Marta Gajecka, signed three EUR 400 million loan agreements in Budapest on Friday to fund education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects, which are implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan contract of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million was signed earlier, the current agreement is about the use of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million loans.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has allocated a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million to Hungary for this purpose, and the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million will be decided at a later date in the context of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement for EUR 50 million, which will mainly be spent on research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
During the meeting, the subway line 4 was also discussed.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with an 8-year deferral, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe looks closely at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys in the EU’s still cheapest market, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most sought-after patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European region, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains are the Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa regions among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will sooner or later attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favourable area of Russe has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office space offers the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfing paradises, and thus attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons as well in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying in large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts there are predominantly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down either buy revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or downturned houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are of great importance, but the proximity to a major city, shops and doctors are also crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the aim of increasing their value in the medium to long term.
However, real estate in the capital is becoming increasingly expensive due to the ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are at their lowest levels in Bulgaria, but over the past five years there has been an annual price increase of 21 percent.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a heated debate between developed and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signalled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but it would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question at the conference is whether the industrialized countries are willing to support developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been reached on assisting developing countries.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member council, likely at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be found in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s commitment to maintain its pioneering role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that by 2020, the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (measured by 1990 values), regardless of whether the "after 2012 agreement" will be achieved successfully or not. The Union would even be willing to work for a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrialized countries in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to meet their commitments in an effort and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its 15 member states at the time, had already pledged a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will certainly meet, as can be read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a renewed international emission reduction system, whose importance has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the international scientific report of the UN Committee on Climate Change, which has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay emission reductions, and an increase in Earth’s average temperature of more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertises on YouTube
British Army units have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Since March 2006, special forces stationed in Afghanistan have uploaded videos about operations conducted against the Taliban, the BBC reports.
The miniature shots with helmet-mounted cameras are checked at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are put on the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under “defenceheadquarters” in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of foreign operations.
Such published propaganda is virtually free compared to traditional television advertisements, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur recordings, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored recordings, also make it onto the net - such as those that show the deaths of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, at most, the losses are talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
From the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, by the way, numerous videos shot in use have already been uploaded to the platform, but this "genus" the British have only recently discovered for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas party with tombola and pogatche in the ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, is by no means shy: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a working conference where her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogach.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others wizard Christmas mood with tombola or bumps into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - this is how the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already covered the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held this year in the Defence Department, but the Ministry’s employees are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas of the Orphans" children of fallen soldiers are gifted, at the "Mission Celebration" family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad are hosted, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport beat the strands.
The 4.32 million forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held at the House of the Future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected.
Although the main focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The room rent was 1 million forint, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, one department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party, which is organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the responsible persons.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to guests of the NFI, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 people came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with an address of the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was reported that there was no ball gown or suit obligation at the ball.
The Departments of Health, Labour, and Self-Government each prepare for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health is organizing the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference at the end of the year.
According to the press department, about 180 guests are expected to be served only with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration ends with 350,000 forints.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply kick off in the ministry’s auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas celebration in its own festive hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
Expenditure was measured at 2,500 forints per capita - around this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent push-up.
Since the beginning of János Veres’ term of office, the PM’s employees celebrate each year in this way.
However, there will not be a proper party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites to a New Year's reception on January 20, the Ministry's Christmas celebration will be cancelled this time.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the resort, the expenditure is 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a short speech by the minister and sound like a restrained snuggle.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given to the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions are forming their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite strike that begins on Monday.
A major protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and the work stoppage will begin on Monday – the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act.
Significant traffic constraints are expected due to strikes, as railway traffic is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of Monday’s strike will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A major protest assembly will be held on Saturday, and from Monday onwards all organizations that have joined the strike will cease work indefinitely unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss the next steps.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that there will be a vote on the Health Insurance Act only in the later evening hours, or even at midnight.
As a result of the strikes starting on Monday, significant traffic constraints will have to be expected: the railway operators will stop working indefinitely, in the morning most public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will be at a standstill.
At the same time, there will be highway blockages in many places in one direction.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations followed the call for the strike - the list of participants is constantly updated on the league website.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, while others are planning a temporary cessation of employment.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railway M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of Railways VDSZSZ on sufficient services, even though more and more people are travelling by rail around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will strike from start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy will stop working for four hours, and the Teachers’ Union, for example, the Democratic Teachers’ Union has called for 2 and 2-8 hour strikes, respectively.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationwide alternately at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and proposes a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which is due from next year.
Claim number three is that the eligible professional groups will be allowed access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer concerning the sidelines submitted by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new concept.
Political capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is "the exacerbation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such a dispute, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of political leaders: "public figures have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary counterpart".
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favor extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the tremendous attention from the domestic and foreign media, "have significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, particularly as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been on the rise, so that since summer 2007 several organizations called "national self-defense associations" have been founded.
"These groups are common to each of them defining themselves as a civilian organization, while they openly boast about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (catastrophe protection, national defense, order protection), citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And furthermore: all this is done according to that method which seeks to disguise various political aspirations based on the political and party apathy of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of association thus serve not only to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration in court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-augmenting factor in relations with neighbouring countries.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, so many ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the founding of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma riots, which took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as an occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization is "national protection".
In her opinion, a real "Gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state remained indifferent and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
The initiative would have triggered a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own guards for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma are also responding to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to Political Capital’s Risk Warning Report.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and should risk-altering trends be detected, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the publication of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are strictly regulated by law, so that the practice of relocating the working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the coming year will provide us with fewer such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood as "holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and days off.
Unemployment days are mostly church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: Both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year's Eve celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The national holidays are March 15, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, commemorating the Revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August, the founding of the state, on the 1st of May the work is celebrated, on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day shift" has proven itself in cases where we would only work a day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the extended weekends is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is ultimately to be worked out, is determined for many years by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, public employees and public servants alike.
Excluded are only companies and institutions in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on holidays.
This year, the working rules are only slightly confused by the holidays at the end of the year: From December 24, life here in Germany will officially stop, since most people take the time offset for the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve, or the specially suspended holiday.
Next year, there will be more holidays in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer re-dispositions during the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a rest day.
The second rescheduling is related to the holiday on October 23: on Saturday, October 18, you will have to finish the Friday, October 24 in advance.
However, the end of the year will be completely marked by the holidays, after everything stops and stops from December 24, even if New Year’s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive – harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring “color” into everyday workplace life.
The only question is whether you get used to these small inconveniences, or whether you better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings, consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
Did you miss a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by perhaps calling the marketing department and confessing repentantly that you forgot to align the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the case is dismissed with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should consider what you can really do to give your colleagues unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrow something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s hardly anything more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies, or phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without asking, you should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly angered when they find that something has gone wrong.
So, don't put envelopes or post-it from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more there, if you really need it.
Talking about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who with whom, what done?
Where and why?
If possible, one should not tie the information (or assumptions) about the private life of the colleagues to the nose of everyone!
And if someone opens up and reveals his innermost secret to us, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, instead of directing the person who is not present, even if others are aware of the problems of the colleague.
Reported ill for no reason?
If you call the office to report yourself sick in reference to agonizing headaches, because you are feeling uncomfortable or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, unremitting tasks, projects with fixed deadlines now have to be done by your colleagues instead of you.
So don’t play bad with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not be able to get to the office the next day, or that something could get in the way, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
In the meantime, call, phone
You are deeply immersed in your work, but are suddenly disturbed by the loud jokes of your colleagues?
Did you hear a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
You should not annoy your colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which you conduct over their heads), trampling, constantly scolding or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not exactly immersed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the other people’s fault?
If a project is not completed on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not blame others for your own forgetfulness!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or catch up with the missed, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Workout pants and sleeping: Comfortable for at home, but hasn't lost anything in the office!
Not even then should you dress so casually if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress appropriately in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Wanting to make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of every morning traffic jams.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that resonates on mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene has not spoiled us with quality electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear the new album from Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even when the garage rock with its guitar quilt is "in" again, the domestic electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, even playing in the Yonderboi band, before he - perhaps because a tavern does not tolerate two whistles - began to follow his own path.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, he did not make until he was asked to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and named Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the only trendsetter, also marketable in the West.
Zagar and his band were undoubtedly "trendy", but it didn't matter if they liked to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album titled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The term comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the - according to the zeitgeist and trends - louder guitar, the influences of rock'n'roll stand out.
With these songs, singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere at Millenaris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - the latest from early to late pop music broadcast by mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi has gradually put the earworm on the listeners with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "shift music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but they can also only be produced for the sale, which makes them commercial music.
Even a good pop number can come from an honest motive.
The listener’s readiness to receive works according to this principle, independently of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling to see more and more coming to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
Music is not created for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that in turn only exists in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: if you want to make it all right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built his career rather in the West.
Zs.: We don’t really go his way, apart from the fact that you try to interpret this into our music over and over again.
We see ourselves more as team players who rely on each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that would then be used as a draw horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was meant to be the finale of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the slightly more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them, what was the guiding principle?
Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to put together the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was created - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later christened "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same way, or did the girls co-design it?
Zs.: The song was in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this song still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically instantly and frighteningly spontaneous.
I remember, I was quite electrified at the time, but it already needed the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (aside from Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have their own role, sing perfectly together and aren’t louder than the music, so their singing isn’t just accompanied by the music.
They were also in the back of the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: That they were at the back was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to send them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting one’s ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where it is going, we simply allow these particular wings, the wings of love, to lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
Zs.: In musical creative work actually none at all, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work for a long time, but gradually everything got together, like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song from the new album?
Zs.: This is changing with the concerts and even now that I have "loosen" the album.
Currently it's "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the song "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
Groundless Scammer
This is how his former employee Jerome Kerviel describes the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>ní banka.
Because of him, it came in for almost five billion euros.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do it equally to his colleagues, was certainly not unable.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He is rather weak mentally," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
But as Kerviels’ statements, published by the French media, such as the daily Le Monde, show, he was a person who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros with his businesses at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claimed in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros just from the American crisis.
He had seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would get into trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe that and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had increased his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain that," Kerviel admits, continuing to say that he definitely kept nothing for himself.
Throughout the whole interrogation, he admits that he forged documents so that they wouldn't get caught up in him.
He even managed to mislead his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to gradually develop his position.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became a self-employed broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew he would never earn as much as anyone else.
"When I first talked in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigating officers.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
He made a lot of money with the shares of the Alliance by betting half a billion euros on losses of that title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew or suspected everything.
“As long as I made money, my eyes were closed.”
But then came the big blow at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost one billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they come to him?
He was suspicious of a vacation.
“I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look at him in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, allowing the Czech Republic to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion) over the next few years.
This is about half of the amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kroner comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Enterprise and Innovation" program.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will go into the expansion of transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money is raised according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies raise funds for innovative enterprises.
The companies are thus to gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic has been one of the least successful candidate countries in terms of the acquisition of money from EU funds to date.
Nicaraguan court approves 20-year jail sentence for ex-president
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to $100 million.
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the news agency AP.
According to the Chair of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detention officers whether to let Alemán sit his sentence at home, or whether he will have to go to prison.
A court found four years ago that Germany had regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund set up by Alemán to finance his 2001 election campaign.
The budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget drafted by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The for the current year was still approved with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had submitted it, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could therefore not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives quietly approved this law, which was traditionally disregarded but still highly significant.
This is kind of paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is obscured by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciative topic for the media, which is why they are paying more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past Social Democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditures that are legally compulsory, which are not only pensions, but also social expenditures decided by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third constraint is public finance deficits, i.e. municipal budget deficits.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in order to access additional sources of investment in addition to income from taxes, duties, and bank loans, often reluctantly issued bonds through which they over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through the mass sale of shares of the energy and other utilities networks that they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
This source is already sealed.
As far as we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
For several years now, our economy, like the rest of the world, has been undergoing a phase of growth that the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD never ceases to boast.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments indebted the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been much more sensible than our Republic.
This is a huge disgrace that is mainly attributed to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
That is why we do not need massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been superfluously inflated to a gigantic extent in recent years.
Although it has succeeded in eliminating some of the nonsensical populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is not a postponement of retirement age and a pension reform in the near future, then virtually every policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will remain to it but pure administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that ruling politicians then become officials who mechanically divide the bulk of tax revenues between pensions and social spending.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal spending by compulsory spending.
The deficit of SEK 70 billion planned for 2008 would be completely superfluous if previous governments had not spent what was only possible in the last decade.
If we do not want it to really come to the point of ruling politicians becoming mere administrative officials, then we have to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, but it is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take in taxes and fees, wanting peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these enable gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will go to the currency markets through auctions.
On these auctions, the banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money from each other.
For example, the U.S. Fed is sending $40 billion to auction, and another 24 is making it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time, after the September 11 attacks, that the central banks of individual countries have agreed on such a coordinated approach to avert or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing shortage of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote in a report for his clients Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost around $60 billion due to unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting billions more.
"The central banks must have been really scared of what could still happen when they decided to take this action," said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, potentially affecting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used for money lending between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid of borrowing money from each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as further cuts in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks is contributing to the warming up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again addressed the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the ending of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet", he explained that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mixture of government officials and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it's a fireworks word that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president stressed at the presentation of his book that his topic was very important to him and that he is therefore committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
So now interested parties could read his attitude undistorted.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
He is, after all, an academic, capable of understanding and judging professional papers, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
The main thesis of the book was that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no unanimous opinion among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers it unacceptable, as someone with experience with totalitarian systems, to impose unproven views on others, and sees this as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions from attendees, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver’s license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day you can apply for an exchange, so that the authorities can make it possible to issue a new driver’s license by the end of the year.
The Ministry, however, does not fear that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the roads without a valid driving license.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not exchanged their license.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of guides, the capital’s offices are flooded with applications, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The municipality handles around 2,000 customers every day.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague, approximately 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving license.
The issuance of a new driving licence lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to make the required change by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver’s license will face a fine from January onwards.
The offender pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also use an admonition in case of violation.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty can be increased to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even those who do not drive can be punished by the municipality.
He could, it was said, face a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry already called on the offices to allow mildness and impose a maximum penalty of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanselka, however, no one threatens a thousand kroner penalty.
The driver’s license is a document in which everyone can decide whether they want to own it or not.
It is not an identification card that everyone, namely a valid one, must have.
People who no longer want to drive should surrender their driver's license.
It is sufficient to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered letter.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are void at the end of the year.
However, drivers will gradually have to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driver's licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, this is about 2.6 million additional driving licenses.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, who are accused of working with David Berdych’s gang, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced their sentence by one and two years respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years, respectively.
There is no appeal against today’s judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself has also been charged in this case, but he is at first faced with the first-instance judgment.
In other cases, however, he had already received sentences of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned for anything more.
A district court found 19 people guilty in January, mainly for involvement in robberies, the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the indictment from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police in consultation with Berdych, among other things, handed over information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to evade prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík 30 percent of the prey.
The indictment deals with crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially about robberies, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also about prestige and unlawful possession of weapons.
In house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with a steel core, a laser telescope and a machine gun.
The gang, according to the charges, has enriched itself by many millions of crowns by their robberies.
Except for nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts found Berdych and a number of others guilty of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's vicinity have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in custody in Ireland and are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have so far escaped the trial.
Children swapped - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation of 12 million crowns plus court costs from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>.
For each mother three million, for each father two million, and for each child one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The hospital’s legal representative, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, therefore disagrees with Veleba’s proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dostál said after today's hearing.
"But in order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the opposing side prepared.
We’ll see if it has any meaning at all.
But we insist on the view that this should be in the hundreds of thousands range for all together," stressed Dostál.
According to him, the amount should move between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At first, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov family wanted one million crowns for every month they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to psychology and psychiatry professionals, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying strength and depth.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even if they saw themselves accused of having prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope worse with the aftereffects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is currently going on, Veleba summarized the content.
On December 9 last year, Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the maternity clinic in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermáks in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the District Governor of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina (Böhmisch-Moehrische Höhe) handed over 100,000 crowns to each family in exchange for expenses incurred by the mistake of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>, which is subordinate to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they must use a reserve fund, only in exceptional cases can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low amounts of damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came to his kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the "Kingdom of Wallachia" brand.
According to the judge of the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in collaboration with the actor in many years of work.
Polívka did not participate in the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabis and his team wanting to participate in Bolek Polívka's popularity parasitically," said Polívka's lawyer after the hearing.
Everyone introduced themselves to this actor and comedian with the words "Walachian Kingdom".
The same is true of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Fundraising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the reason is a dispute about money.
“After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to gain parasitically from our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> crowned him.
But that was not the intention at the time to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Walachian passports.
From an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabis then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka consented to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered its owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabis only used the very idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" program for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"Polivka's popularity has certainly helped the project of the Wallachian kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project is Harabis and his team, who have devoted themselves intensely to it.
The cooperation of the parties that are now divided lasted until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to pile up, culminating in the deposition "King Boleslav I elected to St. Nimmerleins Day".
At the suggestion of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková assumed the leadership role as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed the lawsuit against Harabis and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the contest prepared by Harabis for the throne and half a princess.
A new king would come out of it.
He didn’t want to reveal details and an appointment.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It should be something like the royal parade in Wallachia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also calmly register," added Harabis.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages shrink
To be honest, I’ve never been a fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the workmanship could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The combi with the name SW is a bit further, and I just have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the low headroom on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the car is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly continue
I only go through the interior decor briefly so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a quite successful design, where I only have objections because of the miserable middle tunnel.
I would like to welcome a little more designer design, where otherwise the car makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The side bracket has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As for the space available, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
The aforementioned lack of headroom is also eliminated in the combi.
Suitcase in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the cargo compartment.
I have to describe it (also because of the folding rear window) as very easy to load and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with retaining straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and hold even heavier objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 liters, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is left behind by clearly noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when inviting a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading space after folding the rear seats or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And, frankly, that’s what a 1600-cubic engine should look like that drives a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls well away.
When I compare him to his counterpart at <0xC5><0xA0>koda, which sometimes seems like his exhaust is clogged with a rag, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
However, we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329,900 crowns still goes up.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car beats once again with 80,000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper trigger, electric window lifter at the rear and and...
So the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
That’s a lot, but put together the additional equipment of a Fabia and you’ll arrive at a very similar amount.
So it remains to decide which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which raises fears among locals about the further development of local schooling.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has hitherto encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even note cases where disputes between the immigrants and the children of the original residents increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case of North Kent, where conflicts between locals and Slovak immigrants are steadily increasing.
Disputes, harassment and raids among students have transferred to the relationships between the parents.
The situation has evolved so far that police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack on a Slovak immigrant by two underage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed onto a bushhouse and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us apples and pears and then uncovered his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant incident to The Times.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited attest to the growing tension between locals and immigrants in British schools.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks are reported to have come here looking for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will come true if you choose only the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and enchanting cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
Only on one island, however, you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were a.o.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, over the wide boulevards cars ran, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
Stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
Cocktails can be prepared at the bar at the Hotel Nacional.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana to this day, because the once imported schigulis and fiats in the salty and humid air have long since fallen apart.
Havana, especially its oldest part, may have been heavily degraded, nowhere in the vicinity can you find so many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just being refurbished, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have emerged not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another maroon that is unique in the world and above all attracts railroad lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, so you can see neat and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long since been in the museum.
Excursions
The most important places are not missed by the majority of visitors to Cuba.
There is no need to write about Varadero or Havana.
It remains to be mentioned that there is a museum in the aforementioned Hemingways estate, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime floor.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities accumulated fertile soil, through which even weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet it when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the TV series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road that would have connected the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it was left unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, it is worthwhile to visit interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the "Valley of Sugar Factory".
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after dark, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the eastern part of Cuba is described by some as the most beautiful of the island.
Certainly this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading to it from Guantánamo have to cross high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is barely touched by human intervention.
Thanks to its unspoilt nature, this eastern outpost of Cuba was included in the World Heritage List by UNESCO.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the Cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the voyages of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present Hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, many pages could be written about all this.
As they say, it’s better to see with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment are affecting the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should develop a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas, this was agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, by the representatives of the countries that have deployed units in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance on the part of the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called for NATO units to increase activity, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
“In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable residents to start developing the economy and security themselves," Des Browne, the British Defense Secretary, told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached its highest level in five years, according to the U.S. Army.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
NATO countries have deployed about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have come to an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will need to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them," Gates said.
The Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, said the same today.
"I am not pleased with what we have available on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the countries involved about whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the combat requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid newspaper "Sun" described the German soldiers as lazy furs this week.
"Afghan nonsense exposed: the Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German picture newspaper turned to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit during a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
For every Czech, there is a national debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to DKK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to indebted itself with 159.2 billion cones this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion, thanks to the better development of state budget policy.
By the end of September, the Czech Republic’s national debt had risen to DKK 842.7 billion.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on the national debt from the beginning of October.
For every Czech, there is a debt of 84,000 crowns.
Over the course of the past year, the state owed itself more than 111 billion crowns.
"Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not cross the threshold of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," said David Marek, analyst at Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, said: “We could exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, that could take until 2010.
But I don’t expect such a change,” he remarked.
Debt Grows
The public debt stems from the debt of the state government and mainly comes from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed by Treasury notes, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by European Investment Bank bonds.
Domestic government debt has risen to SEK 719.4 billion this year.
The state’s foreign debt has now risen by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called marketable sovereign debt reached NOK 803.3 billion at the end of September and fell by NOK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
“Over the year, total debt rose by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is mainly recorded in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that you can do something before pension reform comes,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
From the financing strategy and handling of the national debt for 2007 it is clear that the government had planned for this year to take up 159.2 billion kroner.
However, at the beginning of December, thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner.
This amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which will apparently reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
These are also the maximum amounts planned for the consolidation agency of NOK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds of NOK 43 billion and installments for the European Investment Bank's bonds of NOK 1.8 billion.
For giving a teddy bear a name, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days imprisonment and subsequent deportation.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Mahoma, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of students complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher who worked at Unity High School of Khartoum was picked up at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class dude.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, school principal Robert Boules reports.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My Name is Mohammed.
The bear itself did not bear a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple: the portrayal of the Islamic prophet is seen as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knows her well, and she never would have done anything that could bring her too close to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is only an innocent mistake.
An opinion that many students of the teacher share, who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Keep in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common given second name in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of reverence to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo on Wednesday morning concluded a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner urged Belgrade and Pristina to meet their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika had received an order from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation contract to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's granting independence at the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
One-sided Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN administration for eight years, Western countries consider EU-supervised independence to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is willing to announce these unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in their favor.
Belgrade insists on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced in the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations of the last chance have been conducted.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province shared his regrets.
However, he added that the Belgrade-proposed plan for autonomy belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, was of the opinion that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it particularly fosters a “Domino effect” in a region that is still so much weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
To the journalists, Fatmir Sejdiu replied that Kosovo’s parliament will have the last word on status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population will take place in consultation with the Western countries.
Bush calls for an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference assembled under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further explained that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them reach a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must cease its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments regarding the roadmap for peace that they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately aim for a peace treaty to clarify all open issues without exception, and including the key issues.
This designation includes the three serious problems that are the main focus of the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the course of the 1948 conflict, which lies in the present state of Israel.
After the American president, Abbas took the floor, insisting that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he pledged that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, coexisting by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received a pledge in this sense from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries to offer Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, says the Saudi Arabian prince in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are facing each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no deployment, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a police spokesman explained.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without registration, i.e. not approved for public transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without a helmet, hit at very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after disregarding its advance from the right, a police officer said.
The alcohol control carried out on the vehicle passengers has a lot of negative effects.
The condition of the car (bent fender, split windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the Attorney General of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary homicide and the lack of assistance to persons at risk", in consultation with the Val-d'Oise Public Security Directorate.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor explained that at this stage, the investigation of the IGPN excludes the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard Sunday evening, have confirmed the policeman’s version, namely that this small-powered bicycle has reached its left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsyed yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly circulated that the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, and without providing assistance to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious errors.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires further investigation and requires very careful action.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness says.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who was limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the youngsters, the fourth one on the phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the incident and, it seems, due to the certainty that the persons present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken in the car by colleagues who arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescuers arrived about twenty minutes after the policemen left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces did not provide any help to the young people.
First aid was provided to these young people.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed.
In Pakistan, tensions are rising.
On Monday, Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations since the state of emergency had been declared by General Musharraf two days earlier.
According to witnesses, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the emergency measures in the city of Lahore in the east of the country had been injured by the tear gas grenades used by law enforcement.
They then threw stones with which they wounded the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, attorneys of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the meeting.
Further demonstrations had taken place in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyers’ movement received Monday support from the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency, and waste to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promises no longer apply
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in a direct ballot on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to Supreme Court decisions, the magistrate explained to The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to surrender the command of the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the call to the state of emergency, said Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
More than one-third of pregnancies are still unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law that allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of women between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed for better control of fertility.
Eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
In one out of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the International Space Station (ISS) crew will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools embroidered by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a large cylindrical part that will soon accommodate European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-tonne module for generating electricity via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew went on to restructure the solar panels of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be unfolded like accordions, was damaged by a jammed cable about a meter long.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the Discovery space shuttle for a check-in and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resilient, very skilled, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old trained doctor was selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fastened a kind of rail on the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker who stayed near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey racket, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels, which generate several hundred volts, had been conceived and crafted by the astronauts aboard the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the collector to be fully unfolded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the Discovery space shuttle to take the expected return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Aviation and Defense Group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counter the A400M’s backlog, the EADS stock is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS is currently losing 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again, referring to the backlog caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delayed the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amounts to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further detail.
The Group also states that the estimation of the new costs is related to the six-month arrears.
As a reminder, EADS's business performance fell from 86% in 2006, largely due to the cost associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting when counting the urns: the masses of Russians will decide for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very closed-down election campaign, it confirms its quest for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses a message broadcast on public broadcasters to the voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is being announced.
Yesterday, when the president received the foreign ambassadors, he failed to see through and was content to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference—his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have lost their way.
It denounces an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparovder had been sentenced to five days in prison for unlawful demonstrations, according to his attorney.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much further questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and the almighty party United Russia, which will elect government and president?
Whatever it is going to be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Saint Petersburg goes even further back: bourgeois society has only developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous communal spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has rejoined the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility that they briefly displayed after the disintegration of the USSR.
Why do you still think about it?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to hold the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as they were in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why think for a long time?
Those in power aren’t so bad, why replace them?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in Bad Arolsen for a total length of 27 km, could not be viewed until now, unless with a humanitarian purpose, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. on the request of a former victim or his relatives.
In May 2006, the eleven governments – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct investigations, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the health status of the forced labourers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of personal inquiries in Bad Arolsen.
Nevertheless, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One cannot expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, explained Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
India and the European Union have signed a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, trade between India and Europe is reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s main trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economies and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is forming the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products by India Baro, the European Commissioner further explained. The Asian and European giants are exchanging annually goods worth 47 billion euros and services worth 10 billion euros, said this week the president of the European Commission in New Delhi, Daniéle Smadja, and regrets that the mutual trade has not yet reached its potential in India.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England expressed concern on Thursday about curbing the current recurring concern over credit conditions, announcing a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer at a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that conditions in the financial market will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they will organize their liquidity positions during this time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an Open Market announcement.
The bank further explains that in this way, <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation on December 6th at 12.15 GMT, at the property tax rate and only until January 10th.
This seems to be the first time the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to maintain the day-to-day varying interest rates of interbank loans with its basic interest rate.
The interbank interest rate, which varies from day to day, was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has peaked at 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that had prevented banks from claiming them.
According to certain rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound as opposed to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with more confident discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text produced in the context of a socialist niche (session on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) indicated about ten measures that had been adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, most of which were 50% for employment allowance, for the reintroduction of the TIPP flottante, for a transport cheque or for the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some fierce exchanges between the majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the entirety of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for financial correction that had been reviewed by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
"It's an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, no more and no less, as a role model for the current festival movement in America," C3's Charlie Jones told Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also taken care of the production, license concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever attended, says his company and that of Melvin Benn are working side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are eagerly working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
“Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration,” continues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has revived the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival in Grand Park Chicago after profiling itself in the world of the festival together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events each generated $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax returns in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“The European model by Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours is more likely to take place on urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is, in one way or another, to merge these two concepts together to convey at the same time the impression of a rural festival on the European and an urban one in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is taking the burden of this event with joy,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and record a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s recording capacity is “very large,” corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
Its partners of C3, which has received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal, if no less than the Terminator is opposed.
These lure attempts are among the delegate tasks.
A politically "heavy mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the governor?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones you think are the best," he says.
Run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, making the cinema there a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
Every festival on the west coast, whether that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure the producers give interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange ahead of a year-end rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the end of the year on the stock exchange, the investors are already rubbing their hands with a view to the coming rally of the end of the year.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that, purely statistically, the month of December on the stock market is usually accompanied by positive market developments
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts at short notice and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not when serious tensions determine the current market events
Although other experts do not approve of such a sharp rise in the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. These invest mainly in pension funds, which are heavily affected by the upward trend towards profitable assets due to the lack of secure equity funds.
Consequently, according to these experts, the stock market will be more likely to have a rather lateral price trend, influenced by market fluctuations, mainly because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible fall in the US Federal Reserve interest rate, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the risk of rising the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak of 15,945.7 points on November 8.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
In the opinion of Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the mutual funds and the traditional grant of the pension fund every year at this time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop slightly differently, mainly because of the rally that is already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the Bridge Day to the Day of the Constitution, the end of the year.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the assessments of the market situation so far are at a near-technical level, which could soon lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
Analysts are confident that they will be positive.
Analysts agree when it comes to selecting the values that will push the Ibex to new peaks.
Solana of Intermoney asserts that this year is the turn of the big values.
Among the value-gainers, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be associated with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, the expert said.
With regard to the increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine market events in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only seen two declines.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and simultaneously initiated the so far last real end-of-year rally.
This year, with Ibex 35 catching up by 28.17 percentage points, December saw a 6.68% rise in the price.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex increases by 8.36% since January) and can also show an end-of-year rally, will be revealed.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically powerful regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, as Popular is the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches to 20.30h on weekdays and start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The bank’s current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement in which 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday in the afternoon, albeit not for the customer.
Whether other banks will join the new initiative, which will adapt to business opening hours, will depend on the experience of Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular is pursuing with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those stores that, due to their location, can capture the keen customer base of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new, but changed opening hours.
To this end, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already located in business zones, while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of the opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the stores, which is characterized by a more current, colorful design.
The responsible banking representative, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, assures that the restructuring did not require major investments, but was accompanied by an increased recruitment, as a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, says <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O <0xCC><0x81>Donell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approximately 2,500 branches.
And another 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit, specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax stores, the model of the BBVA will not be used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
With Telefónica, they have provisionally reached an agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private channel Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time, overtaking its rival Antena 3.
We've made it.
With this phrase, Telecinco’s CEO, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The broadcaster he led had increased its value by twice the value of his rival Antena 3.
However, one aspect dampened his joy: that’s exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too low.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the asset value now reaches <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento holding only 13%.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to 2,193.46 million to half.
The market value of other publicly traded communications companies, on the other hand, is rising; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (editor of Cinco Días magazine) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that they are two similar companies, Vasile said.
The question remains uncertain, to what extent we can actually operate in terms of stock exchange technology, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first TV channel this year with more than 1,000 million gross profits from advertising revenues, according to Guiseppe Tringali, Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the television business was only up 0.7% (630.4 million).
Analysts see Telecinco’s strong payout ratio as the main factor in its comparatively better stock market performance: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría made a 100 percent dividend payout.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio after the acquisition of 33% of Endemol’s shares, with Mediaset as the parent company, could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far stated significantly more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already increased by buying 33% of Endemol’s shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is a consequence of the reduction in the expected rate of growth, which will fall from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1 .
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (buying) at a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (holding) due to multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan: Recommends to reset expectations in both cases given similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
Congress approves the MIFID policy, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary drafting, which ended today with the Senate resolution on the amendments/additional amendments to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of congressmen and senators who, in their negotiations and votes, had sought to establish the best possible regulation that ensures the safety of investors and regulates individual business activities, thus guaranteeing a generally efficient market.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, MIFID seeks to improve investor protection, to increase the right of control of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and to promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive will allow for the provision of financial advice to specialised firms as well as to natural or legal persons, and will also contribute to the creation of new financial services firms (ESIS), which are consulting firms that merge with investment and brokerage firms of securities.
It also expands the number of financial transaction execution systems, adding to regulated circulation markets multilateral securities trading systems and trading order internationalization systems, which would eventually compete with current economic operators.
The law requires investment firms to disclose the priorities of their corporate profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks in the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The Congressional Economic Commission made further changes in retrospect, with the decision that the titled bond must now be considered complex financial means for the investor due to its high degree of risk has been confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
It also took advantage of the entry into force of the Directive on the legal delimitation of the working areas of graduate economists; 30 years after the 1977 Regulation restricting the working areas reserved for economists was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on a foreign account, does not require authorization by the CNMV and can offer its services for commercialization of products and customer acquisition simultaneously to several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (CPI) rose by five-tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation rates within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which, by publishing the data, seeks to compare the location and quality of US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be made early by using the same approach as the harmonised index of consumer prices, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the prematurely determined indicator only serves as a benchmark, and therefore must not be consistent with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development, while he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, in the halls of the Congress building, Solbes noted that even if the current figure is not good, Spain's inflation gap with the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economics and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenues of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion over the next three years
Northern Rock’s holdings have dropped by more than half after the bank asked the UK central bank for an emergency loan due to a crisis in mid-September last year, and they now amount to only <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets amounted to a record <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably within two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and even despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money will continue to fall until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, will have to contribute about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be made up there from the investments of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly the <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion that is still needed to achieve its target of 30 billion.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, known for his striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, which includes three more companies, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The Mayor of Totana Arrested on Suspected Participation in Urban Corruption
Spanish police arrested this morning the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular), which belongs to the municipality of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretary of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales last May, currently a member of the Popular Party and then chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could be the original draftsman of the plot, according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER.
Officials continue to search the municipality’s business records and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged deputy Juan Morales was arrested on leaving his client's residence due to important incriminating documents alleged to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report about Morales’ alleged contract payments to a Galician construction company, which foresaw the conclusion of an urban development contract deciding to build a 200-hectare area.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, according to which he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory of the Socialists, assume the office of President of Congress.
José Blanco, PSOE’s organizational secretary, and Bono announced it in the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party’s headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the politician from Mancha would apparently run for the party as chairman of Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of Congress, who had announced on November 15 that he would no longer run for the next general election, end his career in public policy, and instead engage in the university field for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the government president had been constantly pushing for his return to political events.
In addition, he pointed out that the party, as in appointing the Vice President for Economics, does not want to deprive citizens of who would take over the post of President of Congress in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or screaming, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time you get the impression that the only place where you can’t talk quietly and quietly in Madrid is the Congress, so the president of the government in the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to appear to have already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this an arrogance.
Climate-propaganda
Since the climate debate is being relentlessly criticised by both the skeptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront in this regard, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new contract with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in need of explanations about his government’s actions or non-actions, which have made a decisive contribution to Spain being at the forefront of the EU’s countries that have least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for the failure to meet the requirements, which sectors this is due to, and why his government, which had proposed the contract with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now obliged to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he envisages against climate change without hesitation.
Which companies will be affected by what behavior of the citizens is to be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and what economic consequences will result from this.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice and will pay for the saving of the planet.
However, there have been and will be no such explanations in the future.
It’s because it’s about paying and paying.
Because the measures that can be used against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed to Zapatero so dangerous from an electoral point of view that he felt compelled to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns does not have to speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of decorating the meetings and enthusiasm others with his meekness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transportation in the future or if we are only allowed to refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, and the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur have also been detained on suspicion of urban violations, according to investigators today.
The city council was detained at its place of residence, from where it was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises it is to this day, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management.
The three arrests are in connection with the investigations that had already taken place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during which it was found that more than 2 million hectares of untapped building land were to be redesigned for urban development projects under the leadership of the Galician construction company Nuaria. This was to build 4000 apartments on the property illegally after the local administration came to her during the last legislative session.
In addition, two other people were not directly arrested, but undergoing an investigation, which is initiated and conducted by the first court of Totona.
The first six detainees were brought before the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the investigation is also against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, residing in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group , the Vigo-born lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company acts as a subgroup of Nuaria and is said to have received the lube.
The investigations are being carried out by the municipal authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out 11 further searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farm, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the town of Murcia, comprising more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana to rebuild, with the aim of realizing a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which in Vigo operates the car parks of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, which specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
1 .
If you agree, we will depart from the term Book of the Month and instead try to invent a price designation of a different name with appropriate competencies.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are welcome to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment that appeared yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is, by the way, at the head of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18, coincidentally on the day whose issue contained the criticism of Blackburn’s book.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school graduate who quoted in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, urged teachers to take a more critical stance on Plato and proposed to remove Plato’s teaching from the undergraduate curricula for philosophy in high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which would be punishable by six months imprisonment.
However, if you rob a music store under a value of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
If you rob the store up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft will be classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty will be less than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. Participating in a fight is less serious than a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellion entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in imprisonment of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered to be less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films whose authorization has not taken place is subject to a higher penalty than distributing pornographic footage to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague is right, then someone has quite screwed up his demands.

My GP presents me with one of his long, weird research articles titled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest issue of the scientific journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn Brain Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct in their response and received the same salary; but if one of them received double, there was also stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to reach such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is in the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave office with a weeping and laughing eye, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre – which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims – namely the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on the loose.
Their names are on the list provided by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York at the pace of a political thriller in her attempt to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers a possible accident caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of production of the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
It is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance policyholder.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to provide the corresponding compensation amount in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance policy composed of several factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that in the event of a higher risk of accident, higher contribution payments are due.
For this reason, both over-25-year-olds and women have to pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since, according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to have fewer accidents than single persons.
The benefits attributed to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more often the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a whole range of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that is most likely to meet his personal needs.
We now list the most important points that should be considered when choosing an insurance policy in order to be able to make not only a performance-oriented, but also a price-oriented choice.
Under the age of 25, when choosing low-cost insurance, they encounter numerous obstacles, such as low driving practice and the young driver’s license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance coverage to take out full-cash insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full cover with deductible, so that the benefits of a full cover insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract involves that the customer has to pay part of the amount caused by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s main representative at First Europa, an online insurance brokerage.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused to your car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under the age of 25, it is in your hands to reduce insurance costs; thus, your credit increases by trying to drive cautiously and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate at the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the said tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalties will depend on the company and its earnings.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can afford to increase bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to enter into a contract, due to the fact that as driving practice increases, the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most sensible to opt for a full-cost insurance with deductible.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish manager of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice, after the fear of the novice has been dispelled.
Nevertheless, in the case of a married customer who does not have children, it is more advisable to take out full-cash insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the relevant person also allows it.
On the part of insurers, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full-cost insurance with deductible (for an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In the case that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance policy is recommended, which only takes effect for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to set a higher contribution payment, notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a full-cost insurance with deductible (at an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance that only applies with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs, which require that a thorough selection be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to reach the finals in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight next Tuesday in San Siro for the point they are missing in order to reach their respective goals before the Champions League preliminary round ends. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group while the Scots decide on their participation.
The Italian team already has five points and has already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another one to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points will not catch Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D matches will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where he will compete for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th for entry to the final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished ahead of everyone else and the tie at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the all-anticipated result, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians at home will not want to speculate that the Celtic Glasgow knows that in the event of a victory they would be group first and thus have a better starting position in the quarter-finals.
The team of Gordon Strachan could lose even if FC Shakhtar were beaten, but he shouldn’t rely too much on such circumstances, because the Ukrainians had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
So the Milanese will try to give the Scots the night away, hoping to reach the Championsleague’s quarterfinals for the second time in a row, after being defeated by a goal by Kaka in the relegation (1-0) and by a zero-to-zero draw in the first game in the previous season.
As FC Shakhtar waits for Rossoneri to win, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the quarter-finals and joining UEFA depend on his victory and a defeat by Celtic Glasgow.
Despite his lower position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to compete in the biggest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus play with UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators after the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared just before the start of their concert at GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to witness the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video about the history of the band, which had caused excitement in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, which will be released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, English footballer David Beckham, had previously gifted them.
The athlete was among the crowds of fans who caused the GM Palace to glow, even though his wife Victoria’s nerves had forbidden it for him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star hasn’t seen our wardrobe a single time, so I’m already very excited about what he will think of the show.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements brought about the group's dissolution two years later, expressed her nervousness at a press conference two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that’s why I thought why not; so I’m glad to have made that decision, Chisholm commented on the breakup of the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes had been resolved and that they all enjoyed themselves again.
However, many things have changed since the last appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special engine, according to a report from the TV channel CTV.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will next perform in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute stirs up between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be impaired.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are directed through Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," Ukraine's economic minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] through Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This subsequently led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drastically raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for one-quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the world’s largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish state health service must improve the controls of criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland in connection with the June attack on Glasgow Airport.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish state health service had no exact idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a SUV was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors to appear in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October, and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to hiring foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency does not have the authority to obtain this information outside of the UK.
The chief auditor’s report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should incorporate guidelines from the criminal records excerpt, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we have found indications of these checks in some personnel records, these were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would highly follow their investigative guidelines prior to hiring, but added, “Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information is available on the number of foreign health service employees.”
BMA Scotland chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations ahead of hiring potential NHS staff would identify people who might commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that the current pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards would have trouble identifying those employees who are on indefinite leave.
The investigation further found that established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been predominantly adhered to.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines on pre-employment controls for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was my concern to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines regarding pre-employment control investigations by all staff, including those from abroad, whose publication is scheduled for next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including for Best Film.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded Best Actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the world public.
The awards were presented in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curti's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film – on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – was shot for just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Nevertheless, he has won two awards for Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree – as best director and best director debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer received the award for Best Documentary.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 Arrested in Saudi Arabia for Terrorist Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia has revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for their affiliation with cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The world's largest oil exporter's state television said one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets in.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, was planning an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect facilities after an unsuccessful Al-Qaeda attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing a Home Affairs statement, says 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile expert” who immigrated illegally to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees, according to the report, planned to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis striving to Iraq to team up with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clergy in Saudi Arabia to be cooperating with the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family that dominate the government.
The militias, accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government, have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a “media cell” of 16 from Medina who aimed to promote “Takfiri thinking” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the detainees were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
Climate on Venus could reveal an outlook on Earth’s future
Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on an orbit show that the planet resembles a distant twin of Earth even more than was previously conscious.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But due to the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sunlight, and a slower rotational rate, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has been studying the plant for a year, offer a sobering look at how Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario where Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
Enriched uranium seized by police
A kilogram of radioactive material, reportedly enriched with uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency ultimately agreed to face a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters record questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who interviewed Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time accurately reflected the state of the Republican Party, which is breaking up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with selecting YouTube clips to show to the prospective candidate.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, immigration was the focus.
This is one of the most important issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of unsuccessful voters to operate a dial when they heard things they liked: The broadcaster noticed peaks of approval as the candidates talked strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who pushed forward in the decisive polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation that he was indulgent with illegal immigration when he was the mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two set themselves apart particularly fiercely as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give the illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, succeeded in catching up on this issue.
Neither of the two men has serious chances of being nominated, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they hit the immigration paws earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates generally share the same views: tighter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
As a result, Giuliani argued that although the Bible was his favorite book, he may not believe the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now in first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pushed to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed at them and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul’s recent donation successes and his applause storms in Wednesday’s debate.
These two have been shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall into; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No noble titles seem to have been sold, no politician in Paris paid hotel bills, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has veiled donations to the British ruling Labour Party over more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the contested Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, when the prime minister had shunned the demand for an election, insulting the British intelligence in a silly way, claiming that opinion polls had not influenced that decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly shrewd representative chairman of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once feared Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The inappropriate rescue of Northern Rock, a hit bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend the tax laws have upset corporate associations against the government.
The tax authorities’ loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative cheating.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: to be a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the manifold donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s secretary general (and her former executive director) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably heading for resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to govern.
Neither do people like nor trust politicians, but they usually withhold their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for long, this postponement is over: the public service is starting to leak; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The issues with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction records, for example, are related to decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's misfortunes -- like the long "money for titles" investigation of political party funding -- voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't quite as bad as it looks
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely scammed.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid, and slightly brutal government.
The new campaign for political donations is a good example.
The garboesque Abraham, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he wishes no public recognition for his benevolence.
It may be, but the decision was not his.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham’s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself a few questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s main fundraiser, who was told about the odd donations in October.
But so far, Brown has not been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by grabbing for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject — to make the measure complete, from a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a thorough reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour Party to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the unions – bitter pills for a partymate like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through undeniable integrity and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis triggering America’s credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is only natural for spinal fins to swirl around excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is hurting, predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of contamination from underfunded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both decommissioning and decommissioning rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not repayable or are more than 30 days late in each case.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its U.S. consumer finances, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It is still too early to panic.
Losses and delays are still low.
According to rating agency Moody, the third-quarter summary rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in U.S. private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt fall in bankruptcy filings, which in turn accounted for a large part of credit card losses; the number of filings (and thus default fees) would increase again whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
The industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month.
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, expects that spending in 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers are taking up credit card debt, now that home loans are drying out.
However, the card issuers look at the money flow rather than capital values, which is why falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower’s creditworthiness.
They can even be beneficial to card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates drop when the real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and completely reassess the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are considerably more real.
If lower home prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grimer future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their petitions to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent of seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The trial was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings that took two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the target of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The indictment against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron ventures that helped tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew it was in fact of considerable value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid copper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million in Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others sacked about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper is sentenced to three years and a month in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was at liberty due to a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States in anticipation of trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh-largest company, collapsed in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer cover up billions in debt or make weakening enterprises appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than two billion dollars in retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling faces a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were nullified after he died of heart disease last year.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least $54 million.
But this is small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire’s Exhibition, a four-day orgy of exhibited consumption held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had built display stands, hoping to interest newly-funded Russians in everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-plated car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Fourer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the nearest booth.
"This is a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas was in its heyday.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were seen as materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi aviators of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the most visible generous money issuer in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union written by economic experts of the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, a London jeweller.
For the first time, she had attended the fair together with the Russian retailer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are all well-groomed and men are all worth a fortune.”
As they walk through the halls Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at the cars and I'm trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the newcomers, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in the traffic jam for several hours to visit a congenial warehouse that seamlessly features Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, customized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically sat at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper Klimper."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from big-track logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company had sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars to customer requirements, said he had sold three car cooler grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which resemble interconnected chain straps, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tyre designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had coated with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-piece.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on these wheels," Karapetian said.
"He's going to keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaires” would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red telephone booths filled with mountains of fake million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw the money piles around, mobile phone photos while sitting back in the middle of spare wealth, getting snapped by friends, or just to plug in a few million.
“Look, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev said.
Surgery suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance at the white Cape Cod stop two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the van of the doctor's bodyguard approaching," Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, said Wednesday.
“That was the point when I knew someone had died.”
The authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newarker Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked at the house at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results may not be available for weeks, will help elucidate a mysterious death that has sent a mourning through the leadership of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working, and persistent," McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Ms. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say if Ms. Castro was interviewed by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro’s house, where a wilted rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung by hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable, helping him to get around the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I arrived here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates lead to a rise in world stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets by further interest rate cuts were reinforced by reassuring comments from the vice-president of the US central bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the central bank’s chairman, said policymakers had to respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm trivial markets, faced with signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulences had “partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October.”
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments have been taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The statements also helped calm Wall Street, faced with further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that U.S. real estate sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4% of its global employees, in a cost-reducing measure to offset serious losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader-based S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of UK default values.
Germany’s index Dax rose by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the reappearance of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for a three-month guarantee auction by the European Central Bank granted to European trading banks was awarded at a significant 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure to follow the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank and feed more capital into the money markets in London rose when credit tensions saw the three-month “Libor” rates for lending between UK banks rise by 6.59% to their peak since late September, after a steady increase since November 21.
England faces decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election, is here on call, at least under this particular title, to help the head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English Managing Director, is gradually filling with applications for national electoral offices, if not for some time.
Whoever does not get the sixth racket position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly it.
It is never easy to pinpoint precisely what enables a person to reach the top of their profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of happiness rather than ability.
It’s not just in cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed that are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to ascend?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same might also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decisions, but chances are.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain’s eye at the right time if he can take a wicket, and a racket must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who will seemingly play in the first test, even when Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind cones in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play in Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at the time still struggling to consolidate, who made the breakthrough into a significant test cricketer and who, although scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores are likely to follow their conservative instincts and intuition for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm after further discussion during today’s network session at Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
Shah speaks for his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is 22 years younger than him, and an excellent record against twisted bullets.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against the West Indies in the Test in Lord, his home arena as a Middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection by the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to regain his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his beating, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has shovel-like joy of life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his stance aside from it has been brought to the point when he recently overturned a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was pick up his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and with enthusiasm to say, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he cones his middle pace with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to suit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not stand well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work – and to Fight Al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have run out, and others hoping the city will return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be backed up at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia had helped drive al-Qaeda out of their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been driven from his home in Sikh, northern Baghdad, by an attack with hand grenades after calling on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they were starting an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop increase and the growth of local “groups of affected citizens” who are armed and, in cooperation with the U.S. military, defend their neighborhoods.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and draining funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged no more visas for Iraqis to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shia residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have diminished.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in an educational field does the Saarland countries express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I explained to a non-Saharan country yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French" - this slogan posters the smallest state self-ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which ranks fifth in the education monitor of the Institute of German Economics Cologne (IW).
In this way, universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
But the Saarland also brings an above-average number of children to universities - many of them without a high school degree.
"In the Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at IW.
More than one in five young people acquires their right to study at a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are also relatively widespread.
In terms of population, dual study programmes are the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has declined by one-third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms in general education schools," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
In this way, the government introduced nationwide comparison tests.
So that the children start learning earlier, the last daycare year is free of charge - a model that other federal states are copying.
Whether the performance of the students will improve sustainably will only be shown by future comparative studies.
At Pisa 2003, the proportion of high-risk students shrank from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as strongly as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better.
And to the anger of the Saar countries, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area you could otherwise score points.
Because the language of the neighbours is a duty in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez turned back the timepieces in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez is becoming a joke figure.
According to a new law, the clocks will be set to world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that no other country in the world has.
Chavez justified his decision, among other things, by imposing the United States on the world to divide it into time zones at full hours.
Chávez also announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will have no relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is advancing a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The dispute was triggered by Uribe’s decision to deprive Chávez of the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spicked Venezuela in the face" with his decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, Chávez is also in everyone’s lips.
A new mobile phone ringtone is causing excitement in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
Spanish King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed at the recent Ibero-America summit by the constant interludes of the left-wing populist, spoke to him.
Germans Threatened to Pay Minus 2007
Despite the strong economy, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts cited a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect in real terms less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault for this is the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price increases in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper.
New burdens could also be placed on employees in unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not again be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 per cent year-on-year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and windstorms at the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that there is lightning on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has proved - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "original soup theory," lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms in the ocean are said to have stimulated reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
"If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history," Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington explains.
Today, there is hardly anything living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the devil's twin of the earth, but it is a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, has undergone such a completely different evolution, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the early 1990s no probe has been on the way specifically to explore this planet.
The latest research, now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underscores the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to the researchers.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with Earth are greater than initially thought," the ESA said.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of airflows in the earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the Morning Star or Evening Star, orbits the Sun in almost 225 days.
But it revolves around itself much slower: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, is hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that both planets originated under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and has called on the great coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President emphasized, but protected Merkel from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not renounced the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained of the Union's "window-view policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there was intense irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only invited German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to information from SPIEGEL, also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
China’s Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China will reject if European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to secede Tibet and the further Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with police, gunshots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not result in violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades were burning, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears a similar development.
“We have to be careful that social explosives do not build up in us and are discharged into violence.
We must take this seriously," he told the "New Press" published in Hanover.
Not every young person copes with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, states and municipalities are already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this already shows initial successes."
However, it is too early for warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that in German suburbs there are no urban and sociological problems like in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had delivered heavy street battles with the police in the past nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
However, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the German government.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as bad as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migration background under 25 years of age is "above average".
Above all, more training places need to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany, more than in France, "social control in the families takes place".
Many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned: "But we still have to be careful."
"Youths should be given the opportunity to participate quickly in work and education."
In the meantime, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained largely quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed, and a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the day before, a team of around 1000 security forces has been providing peace of mind.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following eighth, the riots overtook Toulouse.
The riots ignited in a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecution, the police are not to blame for the deaths of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The chancellor’s distant appearance documents the fact that the coalition is at the end of its contents – and that nothing can be expected of it anymore.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her desolate appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was raucous and low in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be governed by her.
Angela Merkel has dismissed the accusation that she focuses too much on foreign policy with a very presumptuous sentence.
This is provincial, she said, only showing that she does not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, it has clearly documented for everyone how much their accusation is true.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a detached politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in jeopardy even there.
For example, climate protection: It praises the decisions of Heiligendamm unbridled, but does not say how the climate goals in this country should be achieved.
At all, the self-praise - so much immodesty the CDU chief would have failed even two years ago.
Now she clings to the phrases that the upswing is coming to the people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than beautifying the world.
But in the empire of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of the low earners?
She has a few subsets left for it.
It is significant how often she promises herself when it comes to the child supplement.
It takes three runs for Merkel to bring out a semi-straight sentence.
It stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are delivering a harsh blow-off – and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is dissipated from the first issue.
He has made New York a “refuge for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney accuses his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
This, for its part, counters with serious accusations: “I would say his own house was a harbor for illegals,” Giuliani replies, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of having privately employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are blowing to the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-released 30-second videos that internet users have submitted via YouTube are barely more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets the Levites heavily read by Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding," an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated as torture.
However, that the campaign’s important topics now lie beyond Iraq war and torture debates, shows the reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause burns in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney says, groaning and imploring the base and television audience that he was still one of the advocates of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, gets in trouble when he is asked what he thinks about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civil for the first time
A day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has been sworn in for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad live.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf had imposed on November 3.
Soon after his oath, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency and thus meet another demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had appointed with lawyers weighed by him following the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, had rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of northern Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Krautrock Return
Germany’s supergroup of the seventies re-music: The three band members of Harmonia took up their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a recording from her big time "Live 1974" is published.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The sensation then takes place in the form of three gentlemen on the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the middle in a flower-white shirt at the age of 63.
Links flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in possession of laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves himself concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally fits into a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing again has caused some excitement among krautrock lovers.
One may reveal here: Targeted questions revealed that the name roared through the collective pop memory, but by no means so sustainably, that this band has been painfully missing for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock was always considered more in England and America than in our own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for life’s work to the survivors of the Cologne-based group Can in 2003, German pop faces were inquiring in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration abroad is one thing.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this time also developed a far lesser effect power than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first, they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently earned a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the perhaps most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile in Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Alte Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as city fleeing communards.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to torment himself as a nanny.
Rather in a striking artistic life.
Supposedly, there was also a pennant of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing association in the block waste and a name for the art.
There were some things that Harmonia did.
The first album was called "Music by Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because as calm and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The gathering of rice was not solely for self-discovery.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record set of almost 50 people, as someone thinks to remember.
From Rother came the desire to force Harmonia and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful ever since than Harmonia.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as its own German contribution to live music.
New! has already been excavated as Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berliner Haus der Kulturen der Welt.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is here, the British, altpunk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
This would outline the entire range of influences of Krautrock on subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills the space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno’s phrase floats with the strangest sounds in the room: “The only true music, you belong to the future.”
There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the farmer's room.
The legend is formed by projections of further black-and-white photographs of wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No longer by gluing microphones to the organ and to the drums to elicit unprecedented sounds from the instruments via self-made effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three deep-seated technicians.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, she coughs and whispers under sound clouds and sings in a beautiful spot with emphasis "Aaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls "'68!" here is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia cannot be taken out of it even now.
The most obvious thing is thoroughly reconsidered on stage.
Where does music begin and when does it stop?
This can rob you of your nerves or give you moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murdering Peace" two films deal with the Balkan War.
But both are not convincing.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and gamblers or they are too agitated.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help that either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is precisely there, in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nicely-interested roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the topic of Buddhism excited one the desire to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to perhaps look at "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes the hunted" (why do movie titles today actually always have to be as long and weird as locomotive tariff contracts?).
In essence, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry had not been so gracious: a man who has had his very best times long behind him, but who has preserved considerable remnants of the former charm even as a ruin-like monument of his demise.
But despite this trumpeting, "The Hunting Party", together with the German production "Murdering Peace", which also starts this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan War films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian from Kosovo snipers, and one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not depicted here as the sole root of all evils, the TV flat film is all too quickly lost in action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored almost exemplarily, why there has never really been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters setting out to track down the Serbian upper-war criminal “the fox” could have become a new “Apocalypse Now” with another director and another screenwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: Both times small teams go into the forest to do something that the military can’t do, and both times it’s going to be a trip to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the downtrodden cynic with heart as he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also reveal to him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
"The Hunting Party" finally goes down the cliff when the reporters within the last five minutes in the time-lapse process succeed in what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have failed in five years: capture the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that they want to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinematics.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free to walk around, and he suspects the Americans and the French (in which they are supposed to agree on an exceptional point) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political collusion.
But the well-meaning and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says of the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionately, I see the swollen stirring veins, suggesting: how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently it has been reported in this newspaper that all Iraq movies were Hollywood’s big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie either.
Almost always it is true: when a star is drifting around the world’s crisis herds or minefields, something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Beyond All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
It took decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust with Schindler’s List.
Some movies will probably still mature - the now considered classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have by no means been celebrated unanimously as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, also just too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the screenwriters of the carefreeness it takes to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcasticly distant artistic view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied, "This is only because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrific way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust reaps criticism for Olympic rejection
The mayor’s move away from Hamburg’s application for the Summer Olympics has received fierce criticism from politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But von Beust calls for realism in assessing opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a waiver on Wednesday as "not good for the business location."
No other project has recently unfolded such great motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sport policy momentum could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "which assumes a changed timeline."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the sports federation expected for the beginning of December on a Munich application for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities until 2028 in the period previously envisaged by us."
However, the dream was not dreamed out for all time, von Beust said.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements by Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer compete for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to take a chance by burying the plans already at this time," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
Renouncing the application would also be in contradiction with the statement made by the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception at the General Assembly of the General German Higher Education Sports Association.
There, von Beust described Hamburg’s application for the 2015 Universiade as “not a substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only last week nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD Citizenship Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it put Olympia on the map and excluded housing," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for an integrated planning for Olympia and a later housing use for the Little Grasbrook, the CDU has unilaterally opted for the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had sparked a lot of enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Anyone who combines the terms Sweden and wooden box thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol’s work directory.
The majority of the ninety-four "type Stockholm" Brillo boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes of 1968 a few months ago, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to a sobering result: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has probably given to the Moderna Museet in 1995 as a gift, are also available in Stockholm.
The prehistory is nested, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the soap powder "Brillo" cardboard boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These were not (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
They were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at the time entered art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the designation "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator at Moderna Museet, has examined not only the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, but also three from Swedish privately owned, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press chipboards were first primed and emeralded, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press chipboard with a paint roller without primer - in addition, it is not oil, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet, said: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced to investigate the "severe allegations" raised in respect of the soap-powder boxes.
Since then, however, they have been enveloped in relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up, who have sheltered themselves in a Manila hotel and called for the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot account for bloodshed, said Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, to reporters at the hotel.
Government loyal soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas use.
Around two dozen soldiers had been confined to the building for hours.
About half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly stand down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen who were supposed to guard him had apparently run over to him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and called for the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces locked the district around the prestigious hotel.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the Scout Rangers’ elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics had called for major demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manila's financial district was the main scene of the attempted mutiny of some 200 military personnel against Arroyo as early as 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours due to the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
The option remains open to increasing the share of Versatel.
The move aims to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Previously, on Wednesday, there had already been suspicions about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considers the shares to be only a third party, it said in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already taken a share of almost 10 percent in the mobile telephony company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
United has purchased 5.15 million shares for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.4 million.
In addition, the companies have started discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP to take over its competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to settle for just over ten percent of Freenet and not make use of their right to acquire another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies, however, remained open to all options, in particular also to further increase the stake in Freenet AG, it said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has been running for months and is difficult to see, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch so far held directly 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
