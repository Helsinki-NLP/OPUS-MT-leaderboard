Welsh MPs do not want to appear as “muppets”
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today as AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from across the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour Party representative explained his group was concerned because “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means “dustete”, and pwp means “slut”.
A representative of the Wales party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh section of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of the MWP is very close to the word "Muppet", which in addition to being the name of some well-known dolls, is also a British slang word for "dust".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: “Of course, it is the members themselves who have the last authority as to which name to refer to.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Welsh Parliament to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public hearing that showed public support for renaming the National Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the option MWP received the most support during the public consultation.
Apparently, representatives are suggesting other options, but getting all parties to reach an agreement could lead to headaches for Parliament President Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a draft legislation for the name change within the next couple of weeks.
The legislation surrounding the reform will include other changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for the disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last right to vote on what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide whether to change the country’s name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a claim to their territory, and has on several occasions opposed the country's applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin’s are stilling – the crickets in Harlem are struggling
“The old people I talked to told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
“Now there’s none of them.”
He said the abandonment of the bars was understandable.
“People socially interact with each other in other ways,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local community, which everyone visits on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling possessions will not last as long as the leaders think. “And sooner or later they are back at the starting point.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won’t help the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuary.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only hasten the day when these churches will have to close their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both crickets were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin's received a black parish under the pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street - one of Harlem's main streets - for failing to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson’s parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson’s son and successor at St. Martin’s, proudly declared the carillon to be “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated interaction between architects and contractors, some of whom are hired by the church's layman's leadership and others by the diocese.
The Council of Churches – the church’s leadership, consisting of lay people – wrote to the diocese in July about its concern that the diocese would “try to impose costs” on the Council, despite the fact that the Council of Churches had not been involved in the initiation of the architects or contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures thirteen-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he popped after lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and that he and a group of others were swimming over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was screaming out of excitement at catching a lobster, but he eventually realized that the boy was screaming 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
His entire collar bone was torn up,” says Hammel, who discovered the injury when he reached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles also said the victim suffered serious injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to make its way into the UK’s beauty care market
Sainsbury’s challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warehouse-like makeup and beauty care shelves, staffed by specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a powerful entry into the UK’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which is experiencing steady growth as sales figures for clothing and homeware fall. If the attempt proves successful, the concept will expand to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is the result of the supermarket’s attempt to find a new use for the space previously used for TVs, microwave ovens and homeware.
Sainsbury’s has said they will double the number of beauty care products they offer to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the retail chain has never sold before.
Existing product ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees will also be better placed in branded areas, just like in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its Boutique makeup brand with mainly vegan products, as there is growing demand for this among younger customers.
The fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop is also testing tables in two Sainsbury’s stores, one opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the other will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
E-commerce and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that sales will gradually look more and more like a department store as the supermarket takes up the fight against cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods outside of food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets after purchasing both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to upgrade its beauty care and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was discontinued after a dispute over the distribution of income from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 store cafeterias to Celesio, owner of the pharmacy chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commerce Director, said: “We’ve transformed the look and design of our beauty shelves to create a more welcoming environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will then be ready to provide advice and help.
Our brand range is designed to meet every need, and the inviting surroundings and practical placements mean we are now a beauty care competitor that represents a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby resigns from a deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is said to be furious after TV host Holly Willoughby resigned from an 11 million-dollar deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby, 37, who hosts This Morning, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons' Den star Peter Jones by resigning from their profitable lifestyle brand at the last second to focus on her own new gold-edged contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “furious” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where the television’s golden girl admitted that her new deals — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — mean she no longer has time left for their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was going to leave Truly, Jones left the UK on her way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security for the next decades.
Everyone was shocked that she had decided to resign.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now a warehouse full of goods stands at the headquarters in Marlow, which is now ready for sale.”
Experts believe the This Morning presenter, who is among the UK’s most popular stars, could cost the company several million pounds due to large investments in products such as pillows and candles, fashion and cow’s clothing, as well as a potential delay in launch.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman of the board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones holds a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin hosting the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
“We’re in love and we’re in love”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment some would consider to be “slightly presidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much away?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I haven’t given anything away.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, having himself declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a major dirt on the road to nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the talks on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “corresponding response” from the United States to its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead, the United States still has sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for an assembly of his constituents.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, such as putting an end to rocket tests, helping to release hostages and having the remains of U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have around 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the area right in front of him.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia devastate island and kill hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombok residents had lost their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it quite clear that they are not asking for international help, so it’s quite challenging,” Sumbung explained.
Save the Children is now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure if foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Agency for Crisis Management, said the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Considering the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is terribly poorly prepared to cope with the anger of nature.
Lights to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, even if a warning had been issued, has probably contributed to the death toll.
Even under the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia’s declining infrastructure a key point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for Joko's administration, which is due for re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have switched to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late equalization in match against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the match at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to his left foot before sending it towards the longest corner.
The attempt ran high above the box as the ball fell towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally ran over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq are always pushing the ball forward as well as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and touch the ball once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked it on."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the break, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker sent a pass with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's field half.
Kovacic made a quick surrender in the midfield.
He then fired off a great breakthrough pass that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the men's European Football League in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia reaches 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's crisis management agency announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a 7.5-stroke that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, the agency's spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from demolished buildings.
Police Arrest a Man (32) for Murder After A Woman Is Stabbed To Death
A murder investigation has begun after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I would ask anyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car cameras, to contact us – they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A spokesperson for the police confirmed that the deceased woman was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She said, “It’s so horrible” over and over again.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were behind the blockade, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the blockade and oversaw the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are asked to send an instant message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, by referring to “log 247” from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial dragged into the dispute about "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would have been poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick’s publishing house as “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, says: “In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace would also become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's marvelous representation of Cromwell is proof of 19th-century opinions and is part of the historiography of a man many still believe deserves to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressures – in his time, of course, it was about the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating.”
Killing pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in its market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, known only by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead and covered with blood from a ruptured artery near a binge at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005, in the city of Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate to a nearby pig farm was open.
He said that inside the pork lane there was a big madman with blood on his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the pig weighing 250 kg had killed the man.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and maltreated,” explained the cousin, referred to by the surname Wu, in a quote to the Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else.
Yuan’s family and market leadership are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Although rare, it is not the first time that a pig has attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts, inflicting serious injuries on the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg pig until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive normally, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, and are very curious... they don’t try to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.”
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rain in the southwest of the United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler ocean on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rain on her journey through northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had a 135 km/h wind and was a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 ET on Sunday, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a trough begins to form across the Pacific Ocean and move eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward towards the southwestern United States.
Pink will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the interaction between tropical humidity and the trough approaching will lead to widespread heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, floating debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep-tropical humidity will lead to precipitation rates of up to 5–7 cm per hour in some areas, especially southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around the desert on foot as long as there is a risk of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause river valleys to turn into widespread rushing rivers, and thunderstorms will cause local gusts of wind that may contain dust and sand.
The draught approaching will cause local heavy rains for parts of the coast along southern California.
Total rainfall above 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to floating debris and fast, as well as slippery roadways.
This will be the first rainfall in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
October may cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics stay very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of severe temperature differences across the Central United States on Sunday.
There will be nearly 11 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is likely to have a warm start in October, with degrees high in the twenties from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City could reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this would be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the eastern United States will most likely have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, spread across six TV networks, saw Thursday’s poignant testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday’s big surprise at the last second, when it emerged that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate court that she is 100 percent sure that an drunken Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take her clothes off at a junior high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent sure this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewing numbers were not immediately available to other networks displaying the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring office visitors.
To give some perspective, this is the viewership figure that corresponds to the playoffs of the American Football Championship or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led the networks, with an average viewership of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was still a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake was the protagonist of Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican's office made a statement that he was going to vote in Kavanaugh's favor, and on Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras as he tried to take the elevator to a court committee meeting as protesters shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with lowered gaze for several minutes as he was scolded, while the incident was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling our country the truth?”
He was told that “you are in power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office has made a statement, and said as the elevator doors closed he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered the hearing directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be passed to the entire Senate for voting.
But Flake said he would only be willing to do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate by next week, as the Democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a major impact, as it was clear that Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of 'political game' around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused opponents of her plan to leave the EU of playing “political games” with Britain’s future and undermining the nation’s interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, pressed side by side with her own on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called “Chequers” plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “utterly ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the LSU player's death
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with premeditated murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost their glasses during the basketball game.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The forensic surgeon in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, stating the cause of death as a gunshot wound in the head and through the throat.
The police thank Louisiana State Police’s Refugee Retrieval Task Force, the state police laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local population for their contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the area’s police force for their “hard work and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "broken" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
“This is what we fear at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano splashes ash over Mexico City
The ash that erupts from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastre, Mexico’s public agency for crisis prevention, warned Mexico’s people on Saturday that they would have to stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within a day.
The agency monitored several cases of bubbling and shaking.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of the cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after Protestants for independence clashed with police, while several thousand took part in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists were held back by riot police, bombarding them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Hand fighting also broke out later in the day, when police used batons to limit fighting.
For hours, independence protesters stood and shouted “Never forget, never forgive,” face to face with unionist protesters shouting “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
Tension remains high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming overwhelm for secession, but it was poor turnout because the vote was boycotted by most who opposed the emancipation.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to halt the polling conducted at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was abstained anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hopes of Catalonia’s ability to become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have struggled to keep up the pressure this year, after many of their bitterly known leaders have gone into self-imposed exile or are in detention awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum and the ensuing Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said the conflict was stirred by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison pending a trial since late last year, announced that he will stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
“Standing in the European elections as a candidate is the best thing I can do to condemn the repression and regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston
Upset Livinston astonished the Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga turned out to be decisive, and Gary Holt's side is now equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s side still hasn’t won the Premier League away this season and will play against Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
The Rangers are scheduled to play their home match against Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, for his part, has remained undefeated through six games in the division. Head coach Holt has not yet lost a game since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against its dull guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only pass the kick on after slipping in to face Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for their guests by dead ball.
And that’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to give Menga a clear path, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage, the Rangers had had the ball pretty much all the time, but the home team's defense had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed an almost-scoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by Rangers keeper Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston dead ball in a wide short pass.
Crossings continued to enter the Livingston box and were constantly saved, while two criminal charges – once after Halkett’s protest against substitute Glenn Middleton, and once at hand – were overlooked.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all fantastic and continue to surpass all expectations on the way up.
The playing style and crew have barely changed since they got back to the top, but Holt is credited with the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a tremendously well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers didn’t have my inspiration.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The final part of the match was laber – they only made it to the home side once – and it was a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiling and blue skies on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
Differences have arisen over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police cited security as the reason that a crowd of 25,000 were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also listened, criticizing both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to allow him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the division that follows a man hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Collision: Cyclist Killed in Car Collision
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a passenger car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy veil in Deptford southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place just one month after a cyclist died in a collision where the driver escaped from the scene of the incident on Childrens Street, about one mile from Saturday’s collision.
The Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Road blockages and bus roundabouts are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in an incident at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
Specialized Tornado officers have been brought in to handle the incident, which involves eight inmates and is limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison staff have been sent in to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police and may have to spend even more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot police were called to deal with a serious incident in which employees were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be beneficial for drought areas)
It is rare that Arizona is hit by a tropical depression, but exactly that is likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining force moves through the desert areas in the southwest and carries flood hazards.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix has remarked on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained their status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some locations in the Mongollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those outside flood hazards, Rosa can be a blessing, as the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwestern United States is currently in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, which is the second highest category," according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa hits land on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane force on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind speed of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm hits colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, thereby losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday evening or afternoon.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and cause serious flooding.
"Total precipitation of 7.5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of precipitation," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, as this moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
This precipitation is expected to produce deadly flooding and liquid debris and rapid in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. BST on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incident to contact the police.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suffered from the pettyness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the reckless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in front of a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered from the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, denying vehemently and emotionally the accusations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault on her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about his accusation during the hearing.
"The American people saw how brilliant, skilled and brave Kavanaugh was that day.
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, with impeccable public service conduct,” he told an assembly of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president discreetly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
“I’m not a participant, but I’m a participant,” he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats aim to “resist and hinder.”
The Senate’s first midterm vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to the assistant of a Republican party leader.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslide and tsunami, numbers expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out to sea by huge waves thundering toward the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six-metre-high waves thundered ashore around sunset, destroying everything in their way and drowning many.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami hazard arose yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Agency for Crisis Management (BNBP) said at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami was not alone – it carried cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.”
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the crisis management agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the power from Friday's massive earthquake was around 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be on the larger country coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
Communication "was completely crippled, completely without information" from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building shouts desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes thundering towards the beach, tearing down buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that has hindered communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city's airport is only open for relief work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's awful.
World Vision staff from Donggala have made their way safely to the centre of Palu, where they have taken shelter under a tarpaulin tent in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed major damage along the way, according to Doseba Sinay.
“They told me they saw hundreds of broken houses,” he said.
It's awful.
As relief organizations began the grim preparations to deliver emergency relief, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were being refused travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘Okay, this is a national disaster’ we can open the borders to international aid, but the situation has not been given any status yet.”
As the sun sets on Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that illuminate the grim news of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued after spending two days trapped under the rubble with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were conducted earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those trapped in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional should to carry,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to practitioners attending the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only resulted in gray check marks, rather than a pair of blue check marks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who filled an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was getting ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "run up behind the Brink's staff" and stole a money bag to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects escaping from the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity must contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creation formerly known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a long time, using the name as the title of their eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she cancelled on "emotional grounds," according to the series creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphens and uppercase letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador has sworn that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he “never will ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements regarding artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, for its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough,” Lee said.
“Double financial support could double the chance of the next major achievement in artificial intelligence coming from the United States,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that beat the U.S.'s best Othello player, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation of wise minds.
Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
“It’s not China that steals the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired smart heads from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says changes in immigration policies can also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive the offer of a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China’s Minister of State issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation is funding people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations are distributing funds to researchers in the United States, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, involving partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation aiming to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been halted for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim to Greek territory, and has vetoed their inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the attendance will meet the minimum 50 percent requirement, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership in approving the agreement with Greece?”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to become a member of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, it is likely to be decisive because a high enough number of MEPs have said they will comply with the vote’s result.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission has said that they had not received any irregularity reports by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The Macedonian referendum is about changing the country’s name to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the vote.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we will be enlisted with our heads raised, not letting ourselves go backwards,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignified.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would lead to much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become a member of the European Union and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said a “yes” response would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of eligible voters will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the required attendance.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of blacks plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers past Brighton's entire defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian attacking player received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He raced with three Brighton defenders before getting out on the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before running from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right shoe to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
He was lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal came in 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball placed in the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was across the deadline.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a spoiler for the Rockies
The Nationals are no longer candidates for the playoffs, and have no reason to bet heavily.
The ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to be on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff opportunities of the Colorado team, which leads over the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
The Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
"While we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the highest level I'll be able to play this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to take the Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is the starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president discreetly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big ... I'm not a contestant, but I'm a contestant. That's why I travel around and fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this cruel, cruel group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power back at all costs, where you see pettyness and naughtiness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to override to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, aim to “resist and hinder.”
“And you see it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest.”
He referred to the Senate court committee and mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, after which the audience bowed loudly.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, no, I’m expecting one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don’t tolerate people who speak their minds.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I should be censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On how important it is to have responsible economic policies, regarding national security, regarding Europe – ironically similar issues that de Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
At the Nottingham East Labour summit on Friday, it was said, “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of “softer, more friendly” policies has long since been forgotten, if at all it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working party, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought I shared many political views with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed on, ending up regarding the nation’s security or the EU’s internal market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I say – I receive a wealth of ugly social media messages demanding my dismissal, condemning downtown politics and telling me I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And it’s not just me who has experienced this.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they face a sea that gender-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never let themselves be subdued.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross slander has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to all, and every no-confidence proposal and every change in the electoral rules makes the party narrower.
I have received a lot of advice over the past two years, urging me to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better.”
But that’s not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the Thatcher government’s neglect that had caused my classroom in the public school I attended to be literally ruined, I’ve been fighting for better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and government minister.
I have never hid my political opinions, not even in the previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can have in any way misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the representation proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as the country rages our way towards a Brexit that will hurt private individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey isn’t to Nottingham Momentum – it’s to those I represent, whether they’re Labour members or not: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of dismissal or political uncompromising will prevent me from doing what I think is best for your interests.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the end result slightly, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
They are now at the top of the table and are the only undefeated of the ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they were given that led to the home team’s victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
“We have been challenged in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy with that,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Honor to Ayr, they were better at taking advantage of the opportunities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, with a goal kick from Frazier Clima gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to equalize the position, and Jason Baggot performed a try without a goal kick.
Clima strengthened Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before, just before the break, he scored and scored a solo attempt to change the score to 17–5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half strong, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a goal kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a prolonged stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on a stretcher, and from the restart Ayr increased the lead even more a try from Stafford McDowell, with a goal kick from Clima.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, then received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the field to the fullest with an attempt by Bruce Colvine without a goal kick, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Clima when he did not have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown by throwing behind the advancing Ayr Maul.
Clima scored a goal kick, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe overtook David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flanks Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth try.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant business
It seems that Still Game star Ford Kieran is entering the hospitality industry – it was recently discovered that he is named as the CEO of a restaurant company with a grant grant.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program, for which he writes the script and plays alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pigeon has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “living restaurant industry.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, a country without a coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors are patrolling a rig-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea-blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.”
The entire inland state of Bolivia still has fresh memories of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, and the country longs to be able to sail the Pacific once again.
These hopes are perhaps greater than they have been in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has drive, community spirit and serenity, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on the big screen in many different places in the country, hoping that the Hague court will give its ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after decades of sporadic negotiations – is committed to negotiating to give Bolivia its own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who is facing a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also invested heavily in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to take Bolivia’s side, and that very little would change if it did.
The UN agency, as the team in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean lands, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The ruling of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the last arguments were heard, suggesting that the case “was not complicated,” according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may have actually made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
She believes that Morales's antagonistic rhetoric has depleted any remaining goodwill on Chile's part.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court’s decision came unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will provide an “extraordinary opportunity to open up a new generation of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “put an end to 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – has used the maritime situation as a political cover-up.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
“Knowledge is an opportunity to see what we have to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not rely on the US government.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to abide by the promises it made during a meeting of the two opposing leaders in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears ready to launch the lockdown on nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “desire” that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War will ever force North Korea to its knees.
The U.S. government is skeptical of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first putting in place significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want a second meeting.
But there are widespread doubts as to whether Pyongyang really plans to let go of an arsenal it probably sees as the only security guarantee it has.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge headgear, heading to a clothing store near you
If you want some great additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of weird, oversized headgear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed fashion lovers at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most eye-catching garment was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a feather-like wide brim that drowned the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewelled watermelons, a wizarding hat, or even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had re-stitched lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than the last scream.
One creation was reminiscent of diving gear, including snorkel and dive goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you’re looking for even more great fashion accessories, then you’re in luck.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be heading for a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right in the heels of “La Bomba”, the straw hat with a half-meter-wide brim that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another big creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the swimsuit model that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, edged with raffia fringes and complemented by a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such an impact it will be hard to overlook the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Are Crucial to World Citizens
Scotland’s free schools continue to exhibit academic excellence, and this has persisted in 2018 with another year of outstanding exam results, underpinned by individual and shared success in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students across Scotland and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages are constantly a popular and in demand elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, his words reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest pass rates from free schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the examination grade A.
The data, obtained from the Frieskole Council’s 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students received the examination grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people are undoubtedly going to need in the future.
Languages as a subject choice are now valued at the same level as sciences such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics on curriculums for free schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons employers stated for having trouble filling a vacancy, 17 percent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter which career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investing in language learning is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those associated with emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teach in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most valuable to the UK on the road towards 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose from in free schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish free schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that languages are still crucial to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills”.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and distinction to Scotland’s youth.
I'm fine with the fair.
John Edward is chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play remains to be determined.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career,” he replied.
Trump’s meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President starts a series of electoral rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five planned rallies over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his elected Supreme Court candidate has been put on hold, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump’s West Virginia convention tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump’s gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia People’s Meeting online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. An expected confirmation vote has been put on hold for up to a week while the FBI is investigating the case.
The main goal of all these rallies is to support Republicans who are facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that these five rallies over the next few weeks are aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move toward a busy campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesperson told Reuters.
This evening’s rally, scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and is covered by the Pittsburgh press,” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science expert at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show fighting spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been exactly what this year’s Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum’s swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, yet something players really believe in, especially at competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
“They led with six points and now there are four, so I guess we’re carrying that with us as a bit of momentum,” Spieth said.
Europe will of course have the advantage – they lead by four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But, as Spieth says, Americans feel that they have gotten some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebration cries grew louder as his round continued, and sank to a decisive putting to raise the match to a tie when he and Thomas were two-under-two.
His putting, which won them the match at 15, was met with a similar scream – of the sort that shows that he still does not believe the American team is chanceless.
“We really just have to put all the cloths on and focus on our own match,” Spieth said.
That’s all each of these players has now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly the great success story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unusual but delightful couple have four out of four and don't put a foot wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to avoid a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday’s biggest competitors, and there is no other player the audience would rather see ensuring a European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, each in its own hole.
It is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily crammed up with Sergio Garcia, tomorrow's fourballs hero, when he was partnering with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede were so far behind that they had no chance to catch up.
On Sunday, there is no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to watch up close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can turn at a glance.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the fighting spirit some, especially in the United States, have missed.
Europe leads 10-6 at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of the Ryder Cup’s final day, after completing Sunday’s fourballs and foursomes matches with a 10–6 lead against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins against a broken Tiger Woods, raising their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's European side, fighting to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning fourballs and won the series 3–1.
The U.S. gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they did not regain any of the lead.
Jim Furyk's side must score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together have been nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only couple to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they teamed up seamlessly to defeat broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who limped through two matches on Saturday, glimpsed on occasion, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and achieved a 2&1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and third worldwide.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this warm day with light breezes southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won the majors three times, set the standard for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fought 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has managed to catch up after a four-point lead at the start of the singles game, but as current holders, only Furyk's side needs to score a draw to keep the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it does not seem that they will be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will “by no means” agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
The North Korean foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened distrust of the United States and that the country would by no means agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant measures of goodwill” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area, and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on June 12, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, in which Kim promised to work towards “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War, which lasted from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’, raising pressure via sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposing the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can put us on our knees is a dream come true for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader emphasized in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If the other party in this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as trapped as it is.”
The tone of Ris’ speech, however, was very different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland United States with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the UN this year and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a timeframe for this, saying, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must still be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, definitive and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to thwart the funding of Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and afterwards said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had made progress, but just hours after North Korea accused him of making “gangster claims.”
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to shut down a missile site and a nuclear facility if the United States took “similar measures.”
He said Kim had said that these “similar measures” he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Courses in Getting Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by tackling the growing unculture of pugging their way through the night with caffeine drinks as fuel.
One academic found that students at the world’s best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why hasn’t anyone said this before?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to students how important good sleep habits are for academic and sporting performance, and for the general condition.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the university’s health services, said the university decided to start the course after seeing students suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a dorm room, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this is not going to change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know about this, just as you have a right to know about the risks of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to pug all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even as a remedy for weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the classes of the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was accessible to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master’s students to take a similar study program before enrolling in the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm for when to go to bed as well as for when to get up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED lights. This type of light can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Goal of Menga knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another away loss when Dolly Menga's goal beat Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted their first win since February's 4–1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager, leaving behind his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to equalize.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble going on for the Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown from away audiences.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team, sweeping past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from the Hearts last week, and he would have been happy how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
The Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the goal pole.
The Rangers took control, but it looked like their game leaned more on hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a penalty kick after 15 minutes, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson declined.
The Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not get into trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opening in the 34th minute may have been against the game’s progress, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep game from the Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cool when he selected Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent during the break, and the player change gave immediate results when the wing player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
However, Livingston managed to get the away players to play just the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett catching long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the final half, but McGregor faced Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty kick as he clashed with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
The Almanake: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the “Sunday Morning” calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we now know as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science since then, and also became a part of popular culture through the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, featuring scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: “It’s making noise now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he named lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, and are then injected into the patient again.
A vaccine under trial has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced her ovarian cancer disappearing for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical for many cancers, and then injecting these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of various cancers,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar procedure, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and "trained" to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came up with fierce defense of Trump after the SNL appearance.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was bowed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a roaring performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he leaned out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person and they say, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I was afraid of racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee about the sexual assault allegations presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he heard it in the back room regarding the choice of headgear.
“They bullied me.
They said, “Don’t go out there with that hat on.”
They bullied me!
And then they said I don’t understand what the reality is,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want me to see what the reality is?” he said, saying, “Put on my Superman coat, because then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try Love.”
His comments were curved at least twice, and the employees working at SNL looked embarrassed, Variety reported, where one staff member said: “The whole studio was dead silent.”
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: THANK YOU FOR BEING IN THE MASSES.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just “who he is and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) which I believe cultivates and vomits out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on he was "the creature formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper colleague Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion. Then, of course, there is the late music legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington speaks out against "gifty masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on film often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was very keen on the theme.
“It worries me a lot at the moment – where did the masculinity go wrong?” he said.
“How have we brought up men in view of the problems we are seeing now?”
Kit believes that TV may be partly to blame for the increase in “toxic masculinity” due to the highly masculine roles.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is conveyed on TV and on the streets, what makes young boys feel like they have to cultivate just this side of being a man?
I think that’s one of the really big questions of our time – how can we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make a predecessor or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is “finished with battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so that’s how something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, says a health representative.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by transmission through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the disease infection is due to insufficient protection during sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, China’s government has pledged universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked data on Republican senators, sneering at “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
MP Maxine Waters dismissed allegations that members of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles insured by the allegations was made by “ultraconservative” commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies,” Waters said in a statement.
The information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the abuse allegations against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and a straightforward lie,” Waters said.
“The members of my staff – whose identities, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations – had absolutely no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a straightforward lie.”
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is aggressive,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They must not defend themselves.
You must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too aggressive at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified “relevant authorities and police of these false accusations.”
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and held accountable for all actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again by Rowan Atkinson in Spy Parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit allusions in every new movie with a British oblique look and it seems to be relevant to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy parody franchise – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurrected in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfaction about how obviously hopeless we are become the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and rubber face has had his license renewed to mess it up for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a distinct and comic figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking cinema audiences.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean, and a portion of the guy who contributes a single note to the fire truck-themed music entry at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long-forgotten television ads for Barclaycard; the traveler and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There are some great moments in the latest Johnny English journey.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades cut his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy comes to fruition, but the humor feels rather anemic and strangely superfluous, especially now that the “serious” brands like 007 and Mission Impossible are willing to take part in comedy.
The humor seems to be more directed towards children than adults, and to me Johnny English's fades are not as inventive and pointed as the silent film lions in Mr Bean.
The current premise is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the dismay of the guarding agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a prime minister, a pompous and depressed figure who is already undergoing a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this sort of Teresa May role, but the script doesn’t give her much to work on.
Her intelligence advisers inform that since every active spy has been revealed, she must bring in some of the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobby establishment, but unofficially teaches secret intelligence. There are some funny sequences here, when English offers a rock academy for spy activity.
English is snatched back to Whitehall for a quick briefing and reunited with his old, troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, spliced with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class lady role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin style of messing everything else on queen's mission is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's amazing femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s cyber-problems: the insidious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey with a farce: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos while hiding aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta’s house.
All the stops are really dragged out before the final sequence, but even as gracious and noisy it is, there is a lot that resembles children’s TV with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he can really use his talent?
Labour denies plans to allow British workers to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will give Britain a four-day work week – but get paid for five.
The party apparently wants business leaders to spend savings on the artificial intelligence revolution by giving workers an extra day off.
This will mean that employees will get a three-day weekend, while at the same time receiving the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
The unions support the transition to a four-day week so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to make the pendulum swing to the benefit of the workers – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day week during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day week is not the party’s policy, and is not something that is considered by the party.”
Labour fiscal spokesman John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to elaborate on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “profits” of public service providers.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not getting back the entire share because a Labour government can make “deductions” based on perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of directors and set up employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private sector companies to employees, who can receive an annual dividend of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could cause some Republican senators to change their views.
In an interview sent on Sunday, Scott Pelley, correspondent in "60 Minutes," asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the start of the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, skeptical, unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be carved in stone.
“I’ve made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and if so, it must have been a startling discovery,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett vehemently denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she mentioned could not confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change that.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to combating poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicating the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will make thousands of people flock to the big lawn of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event’s real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to fight poverty by getting more people to work actively towards poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless one is willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, taking a phone call, or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – that people feel they’re contributing big by signing a petition online or posting a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, with a wealth of different goals.
They say these actions have helped get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was able to show up to 390 engagements and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the UK who are “helping children to exploit their full potential,” and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the performers at this year’s New York event, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy as a “blockade” to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington can “if necessary” resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria—especially when operating at the invitation of the legal government—is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
“Through the Navy, the U.S. has the ability to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that profiles itself as the “energy consumer’s voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, noting that they are far from the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one trick pony” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
Employees in the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Northern European Gas Pipeline 2 project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which will double its existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fiery resistance to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of fraudulent competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Secretary Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the BDI, has urged the US to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have serious problems with third countries interfering in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, the head of the BDI, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” about her 2020 presidential nomination, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "think seriously" about running for president after the midterm election.
During a poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would run.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix the shackled government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump at the rally, saying he was “guiding the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried to the margins about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should run in 2020.
58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% supporting a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in the context of a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and the Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin’s PTSD at Trump’s Election Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after returning home, I have in common with other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with them,” she told the audience at an election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans: “They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home wondering if this is the respect for what their soldier comrades and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence on a woman, cluttering a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to a spokesman for police in Wasilla, Dan Bennett.
18 states and D.C. support trial of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal trial of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented an orientation from the amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal police has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner “and his violent gang member sons” were abusing her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the Court of Appeals for Immigrants that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “disregards many decades of state, federal, and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban is contrary to that principle,” the amicus curiae said.
The lawyers further argued in the brief that policies that refuse immigrants entry are damaging the U.S. economy, saying there is a high likelihood that they will become entrepreneurs and “contribute with the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view," Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – even all the serious ones – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate Rescue in Palu – Death toll doubles in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It was very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforts her fever-sick son at an evacuation center in the collapsed city of Palu.
“All the time, ambulances are picking up the dead.
Clean water is scarce".
You could see residents coming to broken homes and searching through water damaged belongings in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were injured in the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sit outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
Tears come to his eyes as he recounts what it felt like when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed by the wall that collapsed, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Harassment with Propaganda Ads
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US newspaper that beautifully painted the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the appendix China Daily paid to move into the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the US election marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. officials said.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has resulted in rounds of new tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s tariffs early in the trade war would hit export companies in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican party, Chinese and American experts report.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader post in Sunday’s Des Moines Register: “China is now stepping up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the freedom of speech and the open press we enjoy in America to put a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing, you don’t find many dissenting opinions and you don’t get to experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese about China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumbs of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers declined the offer to publish” his article, although he did not state which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters before midterm election with Kavanaugh fade, analysts warn
As many top Republican politicians support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has faced multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts are warning that they will have a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings surrounding this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given indications that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) proposal for a last-minute FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the hallways of the Senate as Republicans controlling the Justice Committee chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among women insecure voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony that detailed the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts believed there would be a counter-reaction if Republicans forced the appointment.
“This has become a blissful mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final approval, or whether Kavanaugh will be inaugurated – it’s also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that promotes the election of Democratic candidates, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A recent YouGov survey found that 41% of respondents were completely or completely convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were completely or completely convinced of Kavanaugh’s presentation.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following the release of Flake, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh, drunk, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals while they were at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data warehouse online” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, work lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data repository online is that it is entirely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide the resources, process and relevant expertise to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work on the project, and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely reshape overnight.
“We are not asking for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he is launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross recipient from World War I
The only clergyman of the English Church to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann was awarded the honor on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a “great symbolism” in that the stone would be uncovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he crashed towards the line of fire and led the line forward "with great courage" before storming a field gun on his own and knocking out three of the detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he “felt very honored to play a part in the parade,” adding: “The bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people.”
MMA fans were up all night watching the martial arts program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine you’ve been awake all night to see the crowded Bellator 206, only to discover that you’re not going to see the main game.
The contestant from San Jose made it through 13 games, including six on the main board and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, viewers in Britain were sitting mapping when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early in the morning to watch the game.
A follower on Twitter described the transition to the children’s program as “a kind of sick joke.”
“It’s government regulation that it’s not appropriate to broadcast such programs at 6:00, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will be working on the broadcast schedule to include viewers in Britain in the future.
“I think we can figure it out for the rematch,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we won’t be able to resolve this until Sunday our time, Monday your time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me - when we crossed over, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly kind.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was a matter of authority.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five matches – which we usually send – and we tried to stretch far for the fans, but tipped over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority toward everyone because of his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn’t until high school that he realized that “he wasn’t like everyone else.”
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of gays to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the traditional program, Kirsty Young, is said to have been away for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared a bit lost on Laverne’s first broadcast, saying he felt “less worth” than everyone else he grew up with because “it wasn’t socially acceptable to like both boys and girls.”
“To this day, it is these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He has twice won the bronze medal in the Olympics and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador. He used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels he is lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he attended his first Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
The son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was if they had bought tickets to London in 2012 – since he wanted to sit in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the first row,” he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that’s what I’d been dreaming of all my life — plunging in front of a home audience at the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the pre-Olympic run and still leaves him with goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs run on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's Form Weakness Taken Out for Ryder Cup Golf Tournament Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get into shape if it is not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday’s fourball and foursome games.
Rather than being at the center of events, as he had so often been for the United States, the five-time major-winner shares the day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the ranks in the hopes of correcting the jitters.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of his career, and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough area constantly punishes stray strokes.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 singles games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s game could turn out to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expresses confidence in her husband, not that he could say otherwise.
“He fully understood his role today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has great self-confidence.
He is a “Hall of Famer” and has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how it ended, and that’s how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible value to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty and likes to joke with others, he’s a great guy to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to watch.
He gives more than just the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows his great leadership could soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant lead at the start of the last-day singles game in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the car picked up the win with the least margin possible, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only a little,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, photographed after watching Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that is where the focus is.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn is delighted with how his players have made it on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t have done better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it’s the individual achievements that are at the center, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, your performance as a golfer gets tested to the fullest.
That’s the message that you have to convey to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he also has to go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to make his players perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the major upheavals of the last day, joining the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing when Europe performed the "miracle at Medinah".
I remember every damn word of it,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had ravaged his players at the entrance to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to have a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, which we saw at Medinah.
When momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts a great deal of pressure on the middle matches.
We arrange our setup accordingly and send the people out the way we feel. You know, we’re trying to create something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the player order.
“I’m betting on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said about his choice of singles players.
Germany's new warship delayed once again
The German Navy’s latest frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it will not happen until at the earliest next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the mastership of the brand new frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesperson.
The ship should have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class Navy ordered back in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from the home port.
Constant delays, however, mean that the advanced warships – they were said to give Germany strength at sea – will already be outdated before they are put into service, Die Zeit reports.
The fateful F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship unusable in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has an enormous overweight, which reduces performance and limits the Navy's ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag on the entire project – including crew training – has also started to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion – from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly important in light of fresh warnings that Germany's naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government’s defense committee, confirmed that the navy is actually “getting out of useful ships.”
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were scrapped, but no new vessels arrived.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New research carried out at a land estate in the Scottish Highlands will uncover how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
There is hope that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help to design future conservation measures.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brown beetles and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and which species do what.
Subsequently, a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will be included in the decision on what measures should be introduced, such as grazing and how best to take care of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction work that affects breeding sites and habitat constraints.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road as they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out surveys, surveys of breeding sites, and occasional rescue work.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only own bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a perfect area for bats,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of mapping the bats before maintenance is carried out on a property since the unintentional destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young, and perhaps eradicate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish co-worker for the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help in the work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species, we simply don’t know how the populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations while lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as “fake news” and says people “desire fame” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers hours after the accusations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo dismissed the accusations as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” says five times winner of the Golden Ball into the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
That's normal.
They want fame by giving my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," added the footballer with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called “an unacceptable representation of suspicions in the private sphere,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the footballer would demand compensation for “reputational damages to an extent equivalent to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious privacy violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed before the Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99% a good person" who was let down by the "one percent."
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken in hospitals, but later they reached a settlement outside the court because she was "fearful of revenge" and also worried about being "publicly exposed".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to set aside the settlement because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'will grieve forever' over losing car manufacturers
Britain “will mourn forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing in the event of a no-deal Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, I believe we will see production at our factory stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is about what car manufacturers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of “on-demand orders”, and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be delays at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day’s inventory at the Derbyshire plant, and production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further ties with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such border checks.”
“We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy success at the moment, but that we seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production will be stopped, but warned that in the long run, increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: “My experience suggests that once these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesperson said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the fight around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible impeachment by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will dismiss the Deputy Attorney General, thus threatening Mueller’s independence, has been fueling speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of recording talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was resigning voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the UN in New York, would take place Thursday.
Trump said he "preferably would not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, further postponing a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not fixed; it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week’s delay because of everything that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always keen to keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Program host Chris Wallace asked about the reason.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to reluctance to television reporters’ “self-indulgence,” although she added, “I do not disagree with the fact that they are self-indulgent.”
She said contact between Trump and the press would be more frequent.
“The president is conducting more rounds of questions than any previous president,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We’ve looked at the figures.”
There will still be press conferences," Sanders said, "but if the press gets the chance to question the President of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We’re trying to make it happen often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often in the last few weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences attended by important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, as he undertook a solo race and at times had a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS (State Health Service) to express the country’s gratitude and a desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have taken place throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to repeat now how much I value the efforts of each individual employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, add valuable experience and expertise that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ in the Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee States head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half was over.
“He came out on the sidelines and kind of just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is not yet information on the type/extent of the damage” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he finished the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters
The documentary tax increase will be collected from those who do not pay tax in the UK
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be viewed as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters with a promise to provide affordable housing and frame high-income groups.
The documentary tax increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK. The additional money will strengthen the government’s efforts to remedy the homeless’ situation.
The profit – which comes in addition to the current document tax, including the higher tariff introduced two years ago on home number two and home purchase for rental – can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their foot in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” because of the many foreign buyers who mostly reside outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson made proposals to reduce the documentary fee to help more young people own their own housing.
He accused major construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing policy.”
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a striking array of proposed housing reforms, including lease controls and an end to unfounded eviction.
He also wants to give the city councils more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means finding solutions to our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning their own home has become too distant, and the unworthy situation of the homeless persists.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland”
Sunderland’s boss, Jack Ross, says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scottish is delighted with the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I got a B-cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland on Hampden as a child, and there’s always something pulling me back.
However, that opportunity would only come if I succeeded in the club management.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he was not anxious to succeed such established names in the big club, and has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at the moment will be measured by whether I can get the club back in the Premier League.
From the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League,” he said.
It’s not an easy task to get it there, but I’ll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in management for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month brief appearance in Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa re-establish himself from descent to third division and helped St Mirren from the brink of descent to win the championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, created a reasonable income from it and experienced some nice highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but the management feels just right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable thing I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
Perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, survey shows
This summer’s heatwave has boosted revenue for Britain’s hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7% increase in sales in July – while revenues for restaurants fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, summarizing the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern as last June, when pubs went up 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had by far the best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than the restaurants went down.
Pubs with food service also had a hard time with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the rastaurants.
It seemed like people just wanted to go out to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6.6% that month, with food serving going down by 3%.
Paul Newman, analyst at RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and large sports and social events are still the most important factors when it comes to turnover on the outdoor market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a 4.8% year-on-year turnover drop will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide a long-awaited respite.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in rollouts of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry revenue controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors in the UK, collects and analyzes the results of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some are only 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed pages with “fake Insta.”
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they show to their parents.
One in five children – some are only 11 years old – create social media accounts that they keep hidden from the adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to Instagram photo-sharing pages.
The news has raised concerns about sexual content being shared.
20% of students said they had an innocent “main account” that they showed to their parents, while they had other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the rectors’ conference for private schools (HMC), revealed that 40% of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s frightening that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘voice of athletes’ on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics and holds a non-executive role on the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to gain insight into her extensive international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide athletics community, and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will enjoy getting her into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guiding the sport in Scotland.”
The American won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and has won four Olympic gold medals. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after she suffered a transient ischemic attack, she was unable to walk.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I want to recover and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m completely fine again and have learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ad comparing mothers with cows splits public opinion online
A breast pump company has split online publicity with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump to be worn close to the body,” Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, released a fresh and flirtatious, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to a song with the following lyrics: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you didn't realize it, this is not yurt, it's my tits".
The choir continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my buns.”
However, the ad, which is published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it beautifully paints the “atrocities” in the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth.”

Another commented: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “What an unsuccessful ad.”
A woman admitted that she thought the song was “incredibly funny.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would love to have one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an ad that pays tribute to or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and fits nicely in a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even walk out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all the challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children arrested has skyrocketed even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters have themselves been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household would have to file fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to be supporters of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
Almost 80% of the people who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people,” says Albence.
The officers tried to handle the children faster and introduced new rules that required some of them to appear in court within one month of being arrested, rather than 60 days that was the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be presented via videoconferencing instead of appearing in person to bring their residence permit case before an immigration judge.
Those considered unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the greater the risk of developing anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have emerged in the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who struggle more easily are overlooked because of the facility’s size.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without having enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can aggravate trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “occupation powers” to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were staying illegally on Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million are on the run.
He said Damascus will continue to “conduct this sacred struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “all foreign presence.”
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said conditions are so good that they can return, accusing “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational flight” that keeps refugees away.
“We have addressed the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing what is really a purely humanitarian situation.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the rebels’ last major defensive position at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he can soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warning against interference.
Why Trump wants to win another term
According to that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandal put an end to the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic ending of a presidency ever!”
At the moment there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, best-time viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped cable numbers with 3.5 million viewers on evenings of major news.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don’t realize anything,” Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, said of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club,” has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, “Because he makes me laugh.”
It's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Unsubscribe is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go a long way to be an enlightened human being when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of “depth in background material” for the book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s leather jacket with an ostrich feather worth $15,000 (“a garment packed with hybris,” said the Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels’s colorful...
I don’t want to watch Super Mario the same way anymore.
“Some of what he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” Brent Montgomery, general manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, said about the Trump show’s varying cast and daily twist on the plot (wrestling with the NFL, shameless Kim Jong-un).

When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27 °C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he caged in and watched MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not break free, not when Brett Kavanaugh will meet with the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the United States is at stake.
“I remember when we made all those crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

External money flows into the steadiest midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a stream of money after a restructuring of a congressional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly formed suburban district in Pittsburg runs with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb runs against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were an unconstitutional manipulation of constituencies in favor of the Republicans.
The elections in the new 17th district have led to an explosive race for campaign funding between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a bare victory in a closely-followed supplementary election for Pennsylvania's 18th district to Congress in March last year.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little leadership.
U.S. Considered Punishment Against El Salvador for Support to China, Then Withdrawn Threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokesperson, in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted display restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
While internal meetings were held, North and Central American officials postponed a top-level conference focused on security and economic growth to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, halting any plans for punitive measures against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomat said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next nail in the coffin could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly expanding his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in interfering with our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, in the midst of preparations to meet voters again and perhaps ultimately a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I don’t mean to say that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be choices made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such tipping points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret interceptions of the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' statement is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible abuse charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don’t pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, because of the experience I got in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna
Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard to make bigger things.
“It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and thought we could do something and got a point.
Maybe we could have nodded at the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home crowd in the back, I’m sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
Last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can get on with it now, put last season behind us and get it done.”
Women lose sleep due to fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they’re doing nothing to take that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you say what you want in advance.
Discuss with the counselor and the family where and how the care should be given. Such choices can be of great importance in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover those expenses or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Clear legal issues right away.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to keep track of your medical care, and make sure that healthcare professionals will comply with your wishes should you be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving someone a power of attorney over your finances.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down the details in an overview so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medicines do you need?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that view in place.”
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was on his way home after a night out.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as an “unmotivated act.”
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Communications are out of order, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region below the provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the central province of Sulawesi's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency relief administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Circle of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that devastated dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as humans were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of abuse.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, cluttering with a report of domestic violence and opposing arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska state police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin will be detained in Mat-Su detention centre and will be arrested for an unsecured debt note worth $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought to court on Saturday, where he pleaded "not guilty, absolutely" when asked how he approached the guilt issue, the network reported.
Palin is faced with three Class A offences, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been accused of a Class B offense, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of 2,000 dollars.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case will be brought in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, cluttering with the report on domestic violence and holding a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami thundered into the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental car to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he smashed pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and caused serious bodily injuries on purpose, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for the possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury threw the 22-point indictment, including eight charges of murder in connection with extortion, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and wreckage of vehicles.
The attack called for “significant planning and deliberation,” the prosecutor said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as “horrible, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injuries, property creations and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last time the Southern District of New York filed a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was enforced in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to perform espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty on 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the publicly-appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former UKIP leader said the politicians would be “feeling the pressure” of the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs proposed that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain “would have been erased” now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by the pro-Remain Tories who participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she will move on to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the setback – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Bone told the “Exit means exit” demonstrators in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand on for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan".
Explaining his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular among the general public. The opposition will not vote for it. It is unpopular in the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who walk the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Reject the Brexit plan and start listening".
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers will keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians would be “feeling pressure” if they thought about betraying the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is about the trust between us – the people – and those politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to let them know they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before having a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis taunted the conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would " seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts talked about the future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy chairman of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been at the forefront of speculation about whether she will run for President Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors, who have been using the town hall format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to get to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman at the top.”
Arrest after Sims from LSU were killed in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in the head and eventually died as a result," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was on the scene carrying guns, admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a two-metre-high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims for world championship after stall lords give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stall lords would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas got a good start and swept closest to Hamilton off the pitch while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue running in the rear of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove himself up after some pushing with the wheels which left the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free after a double pass to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in seventh at the end of the first round of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race while lying on the wheels to try to get a quick finish and overcome Kimi Raikkonen, who was fourth.
He eventually came through the depot in the 44th round, but failed to accelerate in the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a great job of getting a good two team," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee; he instead commented that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are “malicious, awful and speaking falsely.”
“The only thing that could happen and the gorgeous thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and awful and speaking false,” he said.
“When you look at extraditions and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I haven’t done that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer... did you leak the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I haven’t leaked.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we did not leak,” he added, mimicking the senator’s voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.”
But her denial was not graciously addressed by the president, who, during the party event on Saturday night, commented: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got a two-goal lead early on via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home team before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come behind after defeating Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford quit the game when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the lead by pause when he scored his second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard equalized once again with a championship goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game late in the second half, and he secured the victory with the team's five halfway through the final round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Air Passengers Escape Earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as the hero after he died and ensured that a plane that had hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a severe earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts broke when we heard it,” he added.
The authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, and the country’s disaster response agency reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The numbers are expected to rise further as many bodies are still trapped under the rubble and many have not been possible to reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Up to six-metre-high waves have ravaged Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “You see ambulances picking up the dead all the time.
There is a lack of clean water.
Minimarkets are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working feverishly to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports that a man is missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, and they previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transported to hospitals.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Witnesses said the plane was missing on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade through waist deep water to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a jetty also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered aircraft in the past twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst sets out the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed the proceedings on Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to jiggle together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting what he had claimed earlier, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers’s during the time he claimed to have been with friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness stand on Saturday and claimed he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford’s trailer that night, Sanford said he lied “because my trailer was in Nashville.”
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints suggest that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details, and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Community Engaged Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make community-engaged hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' message
A childminder in New York sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misrepresented message from her mother, who complained that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist, comparing the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up for the first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEII EVEN A BLACK PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistake, a “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman resigned Maurice, claiming that their dismissed babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had been expecting one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands compensation in the order of $350 per day for the six-month, shelter-based scheme she was promised, though without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that — hey, you just don’t do that,” she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned back on the accusations that they are racist and say Maurice’s resignation was the only right thing to do, since they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," the man Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you have entrusted your children to someone you’d been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco said the lawsuit was compared to “extortion” because his wife had only two months to leave and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Is that the kind of person you want to punish?
That’s not very nice,” added the stockbroker.
As the legal case progresses, the People’s Court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington publisher feared readers would not accept a talking bear, reveals another letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It is hard to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to know what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children’s book by a little cloth bear, would have been delighted that his work had been rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was “bitter sweet” after his passing last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important family member" and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
“He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn’t a bragging person,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child doing a feat: you’re proud of it even though it’s not really your fault.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success a bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
Upon landing, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked bad, that he didn’t think she would survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got the phone call from Nad saying she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll be back soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make her heart beat slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body clapped together.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was happening.
I could not scream and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together.”
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the trials she was undergoing.
“Nobody knew,” she says.
“I looked down all the time and the tears ran in a steady stream.
It’s hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcard with mourning women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have postcards set up on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers follk can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression and took his life at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to relive every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him in his smile.
They said his smile could light up any room.”
He quit his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he killed himself.
Sharon says, “I worry all the time that there will be an infectious effect.”
Sharon made the cards “to tell people that there are people out there who they can go and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
“Don’t sit by yourself, you need to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon’s friend for many years, lost Mark, his partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling down or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changing mood.
On Christmas Day, he was in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas gifts, they didn’t get eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a big trauma to them, but they must fight their way through it: “It’s breaking up a big hole in the family.
It's gonna tear us apart.
We all have to fight and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread as FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for — a time- and scope-limited investigation — maybe we could reach some agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “fall apart” along locked party boundaries.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6 – if Republicans are likely to do badly, it will be significantly harder for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called around senators and lobbyed to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was the personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to use his double vote and have him in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'fall' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year — compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices for human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented on it publicly.
Most North Korean defectors are eventually offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China regards the defectors as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them by force.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on the stalled talks on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Secretary Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no possibility that we will unilaterally de-arm first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is unfit to sit in Supreme Court
Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court scandal Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied having sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost screaming and crying when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated character killing” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he cannot sit in the Supreme Court as it shows that he is biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I want to say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the interview, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It is a just anger, months and years where the anger prevails, and she cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that weird, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought that was fantastic.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories from one of my first jobs was in a male-dominated office. I started crying with unexplained rage and was grabbed by the neck of an older woman – a cool boss that I had always been a bit afraid of – who dragged me to a staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry and happy because they managed to take you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he ran for president.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be unfaithful to his spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought there was nothing wrong with examining the possibilities of running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she lagged behind with the funding and swore that she would not run if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount, or?” she wonders.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism — that she collapsed in tears.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press spoke of her.
“You would think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
'She was crying?'"
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The opening ointments in the US-China trade war were deafening, and although the fight is far from over, a rift between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, meaning tariffs on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing, of course, has reciprocated every time, most recently with a five to ten percent surcharge on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match US attacks for attacks, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to raise the white flag at first.
Getting Washington to step down means yielding to demands, but public submission to the United States would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressures surrounding the trade war with the United States could pay off positively for China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic ripples in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than viewers have realized before,” said Abigail Grace, a research colleague who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to re-establish the country, which has been devastated after more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their everyday lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that no conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion would be accepted.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn got the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
The US star Phil Mickelson, who wrestled during much of the tournament, avoided his tees in the water at par-3 16th hole, and had to be beaten by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all his rounds and became one of four golfers to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world’s top-rated player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England’s Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind them, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament’s most successful European of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It’s all about the team, and I’m glad I could be of help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the relay to his countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles games on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely as I grew up,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled throughout the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and will look ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take your hat off.
We were beaten.”
