Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - in sight of the older city hall lights.
Two plants so close to each other: intentional or shield burglary?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach’s mayor yesterday.
"The town hall light was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection.
We have the museum, two churches, the spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9>.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, a further traffic light had to be produced for their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 daily, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of a further traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety is simply the priority here," Arnold said.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a roundabout was also planned, but due to the narrowness in the junction Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße again discarded.
According to Arnold, everything was tested beforehand when selecting the location of the traffic light masts: "We tested whether these vehicles can exit the Sulzbachweg onto the B 33 without bending over the traffic light masts by means of a transporter loaded extra for us with particularly long logs".
The around 15,000 euros traffic light system itself is "the most modern one currently available on the market", explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights of the drivers can be easily seen, for example, even in low sunshine.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, it immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
A further radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be ended for the pedestrian.
“Should a group or people with reduced mobility cross the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone gets safely across the road,” Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver here has to think along as a partner and watch the roadway.
This was not the case yesterday: the traffic lights for pedestrians barely showed green, an upper-class vehicle rushed through - in bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing about the hardships of his childhood and youth.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the inclination to raw violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and discontent - the Carinthian poet has described many times.
The Büchner Prize-winning author is best known as a prose writer, theatrical texts are rare in his work.
Gerhard Fresacher composes a collage of prose texts for his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the Garage X on St. Peter's Square.
The theater maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with proseminiatures from "Body, his family" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa, on which it is suggested to copulate and masturbate - the eight-piece ensemble hangs itself through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the theme with a wealth of directing performances, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses are involved in the sometimes questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, submerged with their heads under water, tapped against the wall with their evening gowns.
Enforced in cellophane or bodice, they stack on dangerously high sticks through the staging, either monologizing loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly conveyed in this effort.
The best moments are the evening when singing - the range ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
It is only towards the end that the twisted performance calms down, and Winkler’s absurd humour flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every mile driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system of financing U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied with environmental groups and advocate that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled – and possibly where they were travelled – and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and voices a number of privacy concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states do not wait any longer.
They are currently looking at how to switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s not something we’ll just possibly use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the mileage of all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the taxes Americans pay at the pump, is bankrupt.
In America, however, it is not as much as it used to be.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre) has not risen in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare, at high fuel prices, to raise the tax even by a single cent.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful long-term alternative,” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging emissions are reduced.
The Californian planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally enshrined goals on climate change.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having drivers pay for the distance travelled.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transportation Ministers who, in a 2011 report, had urged Congress to move toward mile-based billing.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the push, responding to the concerns of MEPs from rural areas, who represent people who often have to travel many miles on the way to work or the city in everyday life.
However, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical of the idea that the government could track any of their movements.
“Concerns about Big Brother and things like that were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
As the test started, Nevada’s ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into full-sized surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to track the miles travelled, but not exactly when and where.
That, according to Khan, would also make the public more calm.
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not compete to help states with the taxation of motorists.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are supposed to pay based on the miles travelled.
However, the devices she tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations aren’t recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don’t choose a device at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxable device that can also be used to pay parking fees, pay insurance only for kilometres travelled, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, allowing drivers to avoid congestion.
“Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system,” the city said in a planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder if the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There’s no reason for surgery if an aspirin is enough,” said Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats itself wacker
The Volunteer Fire Department handled its autumn main rehearsal with bravery despite staff shortages.
Only 11 people participated in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in the Burgberger Straße in his practice acceptance.
A short-circuit is said to have occurred there during sawing.
Due to the resulting fire and smoke development, two people were injured, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respirators of the Wehr prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead them out into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw bales in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was made via an overfloor hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now three erasing attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what can be accomplished with little available staff.
In the event of an emergency, support will be provided via the Königsfeld daily operation group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President of the Landtag Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow come from.
In the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald he worked together with the Managing School Directors of the Vocational Schools as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the Chairman of the Parental Advisory Board on this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor," Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, the Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre in the forest town.
He also praised the family friendliness in the county.
"It is important to keep an eye not only on the family phase, but also on the phase of caring for loved ones due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also pointed out that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to a termination of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Because those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, often remain in the regional economy, which contributes to strengthening the region," the President of the Landtag showed himself convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the need for skilled workers could also be covered.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already undertaken for the expansion of public transport.
"Keep on insisting and make sure that public transport gets better," he said to local politicians.
Enjoy an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dieting seniors to coffee, cake and afterwards to a Vesper.
In the past, the elderly fellow citizens were hosted at the resting place.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were entertained with popular melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front demarcation of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, which is in the process of renovation, will once again be included in the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first works of renovation of the front schoolyard, a small angular wall was installed, to stabilize and static relieve the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further procedure involves the Land’s Memorial Office in the planning and creates a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be made by experts, which will then be put on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made as early as next year.
After the refurbishment, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the boundary walls in need of refurbishment must be refurbished from scratch and placed on a new substructure in the foreseeable future.
The historic, one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, needs refurbishment and has a bow inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, however, the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which has been done by the current fortification work.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was already planned in 2008/2009, but high unscheduled spending brought a postponement.
An important word for the historic school wall renovation, which has already been used for filming, will be addressed by the Landesdenkmalamt.
Should regulations come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the conservationists.
The pupils of the Bräunlinger elementary school, who are now taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, can soon use the old schoolyard.
<0xC3><0x96>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also been involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Stuttgart University of Music," <0xC3><0x96>zdemir told the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music come together at the jazz venue Stuttgart.
In this way, <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, who is considered a favorite for a direct mandate in the federal elections on 22 September in Stuttgart, contradicts the Green-Red state government.
Based on an expert study, it is pushing for a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the Jazz and Pop degree program will be transferred from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
U.S. border: 'Super Tunnel' discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
According to U.S. customs authorities, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
The tunnel was reportedly not yet in use.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar," U.S. District Attorney General Laura Duffy said at a press conference outside a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a continuous battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico as a result of drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took around a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters deep to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for confiscating marijuana.
All three face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, according to a press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time cocaine has been found in a tunnel.
Usually, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were disclosed about the detainees, at least one being Mexican, it was said.
You will face imprisonment of up to 10 years.
2014 is the Geisinger festival year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary year is coming to an end.
Geisingen and church houses were mentioned together for the first time in 794.
In churches, a deed was made that mentions both places.
On March 15, there will be an official kick-off for the anniversary year, and as Geisingen currently does not have a hall, this kick-off event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in churches-houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church-houses will be in July on a holiday weekend from 18 to 20 July the 1250.
Celebrate the return.
On Friday with a festive act, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
On this holiday weekend there is also the Church-House Church Festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the solstice celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger Stadtjubiläum, a new chronicle will also be published.
"But it should become a chronicle not only of Geisingen himself, but a printed work about the Geisingen of today, which consists precisely of Geisingen, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the Geisingen of today also celebrates 2014 birthday, in 1974 the current space was completed with the municipalities.
The new chronicle will then be presented on November 21 or 22 in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
The Strohglonki fool guild starts on February 8 with a customary evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 years old and has on March 29 the festive banquet and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen turns 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen turns 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation certificate, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The deed was made in churches (houses), which at the time was a courthouse.
Both communities are mentioned in the same document.
Reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly in 2014, in addition, the municipal reform is also 40 years back.
Council targets track systems
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the councillors have decided.
Schiltach has to take 220 000 euros in hand for this.
Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety at railway crossings is to be increased - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles across Germany.
If the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures, they must participate with a third of the costs, the rest being shared by the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's town builder Roland Griesshaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the "Am Hirschen" crossing.
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, such as those that carry longwood, could also be on opposite roads without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could widen the following road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for a widespread road: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, brought the mood of the critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money in our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transports.
Even wood from the Kuhbach area will be transported partly over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it is to be foreseen that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Hirschen" could also have an important significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have the cost of the planned road widening investigated.
In spite of this, a majority voted to rebuild the railway crossing on the condition that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city can expand the following road towards "Bahnhofstraße" if necessary for meeting traffic to around 5.5 meters.
The conversion of the railway crossing at the tannery Trautwein, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the rapidly increasing "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had had the restructuring plans of the railway examined by the engineering firm Breinlinger, as it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would then be possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the road’s tilt conditions could cause longer vehicles to sit up.
The city, in turn, bears the responsibility for this as a road construction carrier.
Consequently, the restructuring could lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the bending functioned in the current state of development, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
Also, at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is considerably lower than at the other railway crossings, because the stop point is located directly next to it, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main train station would have to be slowed down at this point so much that no collision was imminent.
The majority of the councils refused to approve the restructuring of this railway crossing, as the city of Schiltach would have to "bath out" the problem with seated vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The panel considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" as unproblematic, for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been made.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Faraway planets, gravitational waves or black holes – experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects that they plan to launch in the next few years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.
distant worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already been found.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions asked by those responsible for the European Space Agency (ESA).
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that are designed to make a decisive advance in research.
The budget for such "L-Missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were discussed, five of which have now been narrowly chosen.
Numerous committees examine the proposals, check with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, the ESA has selected four major questions to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme, launched in 2007, are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, the space telescope "Cheops" is scheduled to launch in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity will be studied more closely.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for “biomarkers”: gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question should also ultimately provide information about the conditions for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation emanating from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied by way of example.
With the "Solar Orbiter", Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and monitor the Sun’s surface and activity closely.
Also of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the evolution of the solar system.
For this purpose, ESA plans to launch the first of the three L-Missions of the Cosmic Vision program.
The Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is to study the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europe, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory under whose roof all known natural laws can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter known to us, which consists of stars, planets and beings like us, there is Dark Matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and Dark Energy, whose action accelerates the expansion of space.
So far, the researchers have not known which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what Dark Matter and Dark Energy are made up of.
With "Euclid", the ESA has already approved an M-Mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe will study the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, thus allowing conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, the best odds for a permit as an L-Mission have "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
This includes changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes that will be stationed in space.
Unlike other systems on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves from the Big Bang, providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four more proposals still compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which will explore black holes, among others, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will investigate and detect Earth-like planets.
Already excluded are proposals for sample transport back from Mars, for the exploration of the Moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Snowden wrote: “Although the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of allegiance and attempts to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment, where no defense is possible.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The U.S. Department of Justice’s indictment includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, then we will find ways to make that possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany are strained by claims that the NSA has been listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that one should take the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness, if possible, “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testifies in Germany, then he needs assurances that he is “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden said in his letter that he was facing a “serious and ongoing” persecution campaign that drove him out of his homeland.
He was, however, touched by the worldwide response to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the public.
In his letter, Snowden made an offer to the German authorities to cooperate "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Charges for Hand Baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers may keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if it was first paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate that amount,” she said.
Airlines began charging fees for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to bypass these have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It’s about Frontier’s most loyal customers, who have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the Frontier gate may be allowed to take a piece of baggage free of charge, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of baggage.
O’Malley said the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the charge before they arrived at the gate.
The new hand luggage fee from Frontier will only come into effect in the summer, an exact date does not yet exist.
Passengers often scold baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that transporting baggage costs money and passengers should pay for that service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most have so far left their fingers off of hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, followed by Allegiant Air, another low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit hand luggage fee raises $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate if passengers were faced with the company’s unusual hand luggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve experienced in my aviation career,” he said.
I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and tangible discussions at the gateway.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the boarding went as if lubricated."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice were allowed to keep the whole can and coffee would be replenished for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to charge for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed this seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier’s move to charge for hand luggage if passengers don’t buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative aimed at redirecting customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were again shortened to 25 percent of the flight distance.
For this reason, a flight with Frontier over 1000 miles booked from a third party brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively for direct purchases on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and flight capacity shrank by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report published Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has attempted to control the finances of Frontier as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs Come From the Bible
More than 40 women attended the last women’s breakfast this year in the evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church hall was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Medieval Proverbs".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, addressed the Bible proverbs in a lecture.
"Proverbs contain wisdom of life, precepts, or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained their meaning.
She called proverbs like: Wooden eye be watchful, like scales falling from the eyes, throwing an eye at someone, the Lord gives to his in sleep, washing his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker had her listeners guess what proverb it was.
From the Middle Ages, church councillor Christel Dehner took on the phrases: All good things are three, make blue, break something.
She explained the meaning and origin of what she called “bridges to the past.”
In the end, a tombola was won.
The prizes lay covered on a table and were humorously outlined before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also the candidate for mayor Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of being unemployed: pilot project for the unskilled in tourism
Today, a pilot project for the tourism industry was launched at the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled in the industry will be qualified as skilled workers for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with graduations," said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would have trained professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA Declares “Internal Error” and Not Hackers to Be Blame for Website Crash
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that a mistake paralysed their public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a scheduled update,” the spy agency said in an email message.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evening, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours, and this is still not the case for some users.
A spokesperson for the NSA told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesperson said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target site is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency, is now in the public eye and faces harsh criticism after the revelations made in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snow.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of unemployed in October fell by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate is 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Head of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have reacted so far with attitudes.
One reason for this is, according to Felder-Bauer: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the craft, in the health care and in the care of the elderly".
As a result of the seasons, vacancies for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have also been opened since September.
In mid-December, the winter season begins there.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäu Anzeigeblatt dated 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Loss of profits at Bombardier after drop in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc. reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday after falling orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract issues in the railway division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use next September according to the ambitious schedule.
The first flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago was followed by only three more take-offs, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results lagged behind forecasts, leading to a fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating from “outperform” to “sector perform” on Thursday in view of the stock’s limited price potential over the next one to two quarters.
“While weaker aircraft deliveries were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries are moderate at 177, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet airliner are true.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Pierre Beaudoin, Chairman of the Board of Directors, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates had been scheduled during the aircraft's service life.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we also did.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to depart in the coming weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical about whether twelve months after the maiden flight, the first customer can commission a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progress of the flight tests – even if they obviously correspond to Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million and $8 cents per share, respectively, from $172 million and $9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
Sales declined slightly, falling from 4.2 billion to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace division amounted to $32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were within our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that revenue in this division has increased by almost eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30, slightly increasing compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some large contracts.
According to management, there will be new guidelines for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday, the Bombardier stock fell by 8.5 percent and was at $4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google’s Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will join the board.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
USA: Shootings at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired on Friday morning (local time) at LAX airport.
While the airport management said via Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is constantly being informed about the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses said to have seen a gunman with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people were looking for protection in panic.
Travellers would have screamed and children would have cried.
Panic erupted among those waiting, many hid behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, a traveler told the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security agency suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
He was taken to a security area, the man said.
The shootings were reported to have occurred near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
Television footage showed numerous ambulances and police cars passing in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken out of the building to safety.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a Special Operations Command and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9:30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were closed, causing long backstabbing, according to CNN.
Until landings, air traffic was temporarily suspended, it said.
However, several aircraft were also seen on CNN at the launch.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, shares information with Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A well-known criminal prosecutor who warned a drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided Underworld great Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
Acclaimed by criminals as a “first-class” attorney nicknamed “Bash,” he was arrested at his home in 2011 after the Scarborough police oversaw him in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner at the bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet, and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after police searched for 1.5 million pounds worth of heroin and cocaine and 200,000 pounds worth of cash.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges of obstruction of justice.
He admitted to cocaine possession in a previous interview.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found out in their investigation into Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta’s house and put the drugs under the lawyer’s garbage can with a 60 percent purity in a black golf glove.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests had detected Class A drugs in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming her discussion was subject to the “lawyer’s secret.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he operates an office both at his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was announced that he had called key drug trafficking actors, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “A criminal attorney should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal attorney because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of those persons.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between a lawyer and a client.
He countered the police investigations as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal attorney to a criminal the moment he started acquiring drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to gather valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public trust and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
Lancashire’s Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and judicial obstruction, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta posted an area of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death row in America as a lawyer, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of ecclesiastical music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Dunninger Liederkranz will frame two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the viewers in the spring of this year, the song wreath will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary mass will be heard from 19 during the evening mass in the St. Martinus Church in Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 at the service in the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass will be performed as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass band of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism gives way to increasing confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, fundamental changes will take place in the pastoral care unit of Haslach (SE).
There is only one parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
The basic decisions of the diocese can no longer be changed, and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new is hesitantly but increasingly giving way to a sense of confidence.
From the ideas and expectations for the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals about the future composition and size of the parish council, the six committees held extremely constructive discussions with the main officials of the pastoral care team.
On the basis of a presentation, Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly drafted guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law that enters into the rights and duties of the six individual churches so far.
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council, in which the parish priest will be represented.
At least two elected members from each parish are to be represented, in the six parishes so-called community teams are formed locally.
Their task in the future will be to promote ecclesiastical life in the place.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes will be retained.
Liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the entire municipality.
Particularly in view of the large planned investments, whose commitment then affects all parishes, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, investments were made in projects that could be handled by the individual parishes alone," said Haslachs Parish Council Chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint board for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the pastoral care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had set themselves the task of "becoming one, staying five" in 2006 and had to realize that it wasn't that easy at all.
The committees of the Haslacher Pastoral Care Unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be concretised in further meetings and decided in a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorfer family has an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the major electricity routes.
These measure the additional costs incurred by them as a result of the energy transition, which they can impose on the electricity price through a charge.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the city services could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're assuming an increase of 1 cent plus x," Bias said, with the number going to be closer to 2 cents.
Traffic light on permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What should I do then - driving in red?
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "adequate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to hold out for at least five minutes before starting to suspect a malfunction of the traffic lights.
However, anyone who continues to drive despite the red lights must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by this.
Those who tolerate themselves less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Hamm Higher Regional Court.
In the case negotiated, after about three minutes of continuous red, a driver had ignored the traffic lights and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
City Council welcomes solid budget
Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh when it comes to the budget in council meetings.
The municipal sack in Herdwangen-Schoenach is well-filled and the administration no longer knows about debt since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be recorded as a full success in this respect.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was over one million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget, at around 1.8 million euros, is also around one million euros above the approach.
The surplus was mainly due to higher trade tax revenues and the municipality's share in income tax.
The wealth budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 million, it amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher input from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
Since fewer investments than planned were made in the financial year 2012, the allocation of reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like that out of your sleeve," Gerster praised looking at the annual accounts.
He and the municipal councils were delighted with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost the citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to refrain from high lifting rates in the past.
As a result, however, according to Gerster, subsidies have already been cut from the country on a number of occasions.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various compensatory stocks.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting sets, as investments are pending in the coming years for which we would like to have grants," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s singing association Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was solemnly honored.
As usual, Hubert Wermter stood on stage in the colours of his men’s singing club.
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the now probably more than dearly won choir.
Wermter was also active in the club, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty: Jörg Kohr, pastoral representative on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singing colleagues handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as a engraved tinplate.
In addition to the celebration, the 31st Autumn Festival took place in the usual ways: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music association, the Vollmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
For their honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Federal Song".
The men's singing association Betra also sang classic choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wenn du durchs Tal gehst".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "Impulschor" - provided the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folk songs "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to their homeland with "Was ist der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree.
For the children there was a small secondary program - "Grandma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children occupied well over lunch.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and kindergartens in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wants to support the facilities in realising their construction and embellishment wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day nurseries and nurseries from the entire Customs District can participate in the action.
If you have a building or embellishment wish for your facility, you can apply with this to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Kindergarten-Baustelle.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with building materials worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on one (action) day.
In addition, the winner must take care of many diligent construction workers himself.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press indignant over controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” was read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new law effectively strangles the media, while The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered a "severe blow" and called the draft "draconian".
The passing of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The Kenyan media drew the anger of the authorities for publishing footage of security cameras showing the units sent to the scene allegedly robbing the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by hiring two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry.
According to the new law, media houses can face a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million, as well as the risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from an official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy".
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on those described as Kenya’s “lively blogosphere.”
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, who calls the Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians to themselves, they’ll bankrupt the country and lead us back to the days of hunters and collectors,” he said.
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have been attracted to public anger.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and put their substantial salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month back into effect – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for the FC
The official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose any importance to the city and the football club despite the cold weather and the rain.
Last Saturday everyone would have wished for a more enjoyable hour, but Peter did not want to participate.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason.
This went to the musicians who framed the ceremony, as did many speakers.
Wess therefore also became FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
First and foremost, he thanked Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association who participated.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rugged pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new roads.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also recognised by the Landtag MP Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were addressed for the city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn area in such a way that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, the first considerations for solving the problem were made when the construction of a third place on the grounds of the football club or at the secondary school at Lake Salinen was thought of.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up about the creation of an artificial turf sports field, which was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was started two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, pledged a cost share of 100,000 euros for the construction of the square and approved the country's funding of 104,000 euros.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining 356 000 euros in total costs of 560,000 euros, summarized Klumpp.
The construction of the 68-by 108-meter artificial turf square began on June 4.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic meters of earth were excavated, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of Home Affairs and Justice.
The responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it concerns direct democracy, MP bribery and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, the issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have opposing views, is likely to be involved.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the issue of traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD underlined its no to a passenger car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for many driving and thus ecologically counterproductive," the SPD negotiator for the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, explained in a letter to his group.
There were threats of evasive traffic on rural roads, which are already the main points of accidents.
The introduction of a toll for all passenger cars would also be only a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing dryer wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be really summer again?" was not really the question on Friday evening on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best prerequisites for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Driver seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on his way to Grefrath with his car on the Kempener Außenring at about 21:15.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Strasse, she overlooked the car of the 37-year-old.
The fencing collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Konstanz: Lockdown after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left turning lane towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer who was driving there.
The VW Passat was also damaged by a 19-year-old.
In total, about 15,000 property damage occurred, the police said.
The road had to be closed during the accident, it was said.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Prophecies like this will no longer exist at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A lot of the loudspeaker announcements are thus omitted - the noise level should be significantly lowered.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of announcements affecting individuals.
Among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already refraining from the noisy calls.
The omission of these announcements – an average of around 200 personal calls in one day through the loudspeakers – should make the airport more quiet in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight paths or departure times here is a bit lost," Kleemann said in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games at Kaltenhof
In addition to the braking trolley pulling with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1:30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are Swabian on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and single fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
“It’s not about the vastness,” explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be dropped vertically, should be folded over once and then just come to lie down.
This is evaluated with most points.
When throwing horseshoes, the accuracy of the target is important.
From eight meters away, it is thrown onto a peg.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying a water bucket over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bowl are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two may then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
Training can be done as early as 10 a.m.
A suitable clothing is desirable, for example, the competitors can compete in a Scottish skirt.
But Swabian costumes are also allowed.
For the "Outfit" the jury does not award a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the wind music lovers come at their expense.
At 7 p.m., the Biraboehmic wind music from Schömberg will create the great evening of entertainment.
The chapel plays floating polkas and marches.
Their repertoire also includes sentimental waltzing and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron, will be there for a while under the gutters.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the fool's guild.
On Sunday, the music club Leinstetten entertains for the early morning, from 2 pm the farmer's chapel Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then end the festival.
The start of the stoppelacker party with DJ Ralf is already on Friday.
On Saturday and Sunday, other programme points include the classic car and tug-of-war meeting, exhibitions of companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the corn labyrinth, the artisan market and the sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw hopping castle, tractor driving (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the Förderverein Multizweckhalle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diets require plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk, and dairy products.
For example, pureed tofu with vegetable cream is a quark substitute.
The Federation of Vegetarians also celebrates World Vegan Day on November 1.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on November 1st, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt should be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Hittable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
A half-crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple cider or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loose dough instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking soda, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can also serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany currently eat vegan, i.e. purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, students of Black Forest High School met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we headed straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special charm in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Afterwards, the financial center around Wall Street went to the 9/11 memorial.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city from the Empire State Building’s 373-metre-high observation deck while enjoying the view.
Afterwards, the bustle of New York’s streets led you through the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which was an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the name day of St. Hubertus, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was, according to legend, a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by vision and later appointed bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhornbläsergruppe of the Jagdthird Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musics on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) according to old, originally French melodies.
The winds wear equestrian clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog herds on tow hunts musically.
The solemn Mass will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30.
The newly designed enclosure shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to the lexicon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling that you have experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the store in the county town of Kleve in sight of the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly this goal: to make an actual stay not only thoughtful, but handy, repetitively experienceable.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A glimpse into the interior at the opening 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at the outset.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually prepared fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the beautiful café at the store: In Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve, the sympathetic cafe lovers are hoping for more audiences.
And last but not least, the college.
"While we do not have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here want to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of cafe lovers.
The sympathetic owner couple stand behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most varied variations itself.
Expressophan
Daniel Büttner is rather the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"That's a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright café.
Better say one.
After all, the harbour festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringing night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not a keen fan of event evenings for this reason: "You can't do it right for everyone".
And with an event I always address only those who are also interested in the special event.
Events will be the exception for us.
"We want to disrupt the very normal operation as little as possible."
It should be said: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the store in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many clever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the guesthouse miles and thus also the café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV had invited "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the clubroom of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence entirely under the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right festivity to make honors.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener was delighted with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You have not only written down a lot for us, but you have also made so many rounds for us, for which we thank you very much," says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went this year to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth place was occupied by Artur Brückner.
The board of directors addressed a special thank you to the team of association landlord Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again conjured up an exceptional menu and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. at the club premises.
"New singing voices are welcome at any time," says Schlotmann.
UN Announces New Goals for Combating Poverty
The United Nations is now working on a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “sustainable development goals” to replace the Millennium Development Goals ending in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am delighted that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the member states in order to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, there is still a good mood with the handball superligist.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
I hope we finally win again.
“Because I don’t know how such a win tastes anymore,” Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-liga reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn down trees, Malmon raises his index finger in advance.
I have trained a lot of players in A-Jugend.
Hence, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it has to be waited to see if there is any reinforcement from the first one," the SG coach clarifies.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous appearances.
Above all, in the cover work and in the switching game, it was a huge failure.
Opportunity utilization must also be improved.
Therefore, I hope that my players have finally gotten their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique, to voice calls for peace at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
Fearing for the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription “We Demand Security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital’s Independence Square.
For the past two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to fall back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
There is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas deposits and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investments of over $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States to the country in the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamo’s spokesperson told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to minimize concerns about instability.
He told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a "loser" who "will use all of his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
“Our vision is to resume negotiations and do so seriously,” Mazanga said.
Earlier talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are clashing heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a sickening movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos’s electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Mozambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza, whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has undertaken disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in Beira, the port that mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded reluctantly to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration about the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said the people just wanted stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” says one author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal power has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with authors and teachers who are “overly didactic,” children would “disconnect completely,” because in entertaining stories, the messages would be conveyed “subliminal.”
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, stated: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them as far as possible in the background."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminal, revealed through history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years came to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely entertaining scene play.
From his arrival through the grant of honorary citizenship to his death, the screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a fun piece that received much acclaim under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained contexts and bridged time leaps from youth to near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's paradise, to his courtyard.
And then the stage play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his parade role as the great son of the city.
He led Stilecht with the two-paned and "Schwarzwalder Füchse" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only welcomed by the audience with a lot of applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put himself into the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual playing scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance.
Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler then gave himself the honour of conferring the honor of an honorary citizen, which was attended by a part of the city council on behalf of the then incumbent Hättich.
The three-king singers then made their appearance, which prompted Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh, how beautiful, youth memories of my own three-king time come back to life."
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "Out, Out".
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the Amtskirche at the time as well as his concerns about the outgrowth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the home ground, behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene play.
There was a lot of applause and praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of the Neckar Giants Grows
The odds of the Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketball players remaining in the league have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one competitor less for the Neckar Giants.
The Basketball Project Hamburg Towers is refraining from applying for a possible follow-up spot.
"We will not participate in the wildcard procedure," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
A first breath was nevertheless not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it is clear that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," Neckar Riesen boss Alexander Reil told the newspaper.
Until May 23, upstart Düsseldorf Baskets can file documents with the arbitration court and prove its economic suitability for the Bundesliga.
So far, however, the Rhineland has been denied the license twice.
The Court of Arbitration is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Holy Communion Church is coming to the forefront
As a contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the City’s Cultural and Tourism Office will devote the last of this year’s public themed tours on Sunday, October 27, to the Eucharist.
After the visit to the Atomkeller-Museum, the Haigerloch period should be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The culminating point is a visit to the Holy Communion Church.
There, the leaders will be told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, there is a view of the Last Supper painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the other half-hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomkeller Museum.
Maps are available at the cash desk of the Atomkellermuseum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified inter-state, it said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status," the agency cited its source.
Because Germany is an ally of the US, Snowden threatens extradition there.
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams competed for the title at the club's tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had given the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf to the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the schedule, with everyone playing against everyone.
The game was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were equal points with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic finished in second place.
The bronze ladder was reached by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphalt Grieve team.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the successful conclusion of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest Open-Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday program to a colorful children's and family festival with numerous participation actions and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, there is the right thing for every age.
Regional craftsmen are available to help the children from 11 am to 5 pm.
The museum workshop is also being constructed.
When building cuckoo pipes, waterwheels or scooters, young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow races or stilt runs, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 14 a.m.
On a railroad tour, the children must guess which stories are true or are lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with black forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, which runs its scrambled snack with the museum guests from 11 a.m.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner is enjoying a cozy and fairytale atmosphere.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11:00, 13:00 and 15:00.
In addition, the children’s costume dance group from Gutach presents traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event, from 11 am to 5 pm, numerous craftsmen such as the broombinder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be seen over their shoulders in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum are awaiting a varied holiday program.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a lovable chew because he has decided to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt is unable to distract from his dream despite a heart defect.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the movie there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrille's beeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships.
The company has several irons on fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue bulkheads and reloaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With each movement of the envelopes, a sharp warning sound sounds over the terrain.
“The signals are for safety purposes and are required by law,” says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In case of unfavourable wind, unfortunately, this can be heard far and wide - and so there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He took the complaints very seriously and therefore contacted the affected persons, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, they are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to focus on open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to focus on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre deepening tub in front of the terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can also be handled here.
"This year we want to break the 3-million-tonne mark in the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, import coal goes to inland power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the grid, well over 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern Basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can prevent us from believing that we can win against the best team in Europe in the last two years," said Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We have sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their only third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clarified enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to turn a 15-point draw back into a tour 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus once again gave the game a turn.
"We fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made reckless mistakes," said Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the Munich team, who had celebrated significant victories in the first two games against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has expanded, as has recently been the case at the New York Comedy Festival.
Established and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of Caroline’s stand-up institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at Caroline’s and then became more and more successful until they were known to perform in a club at some point,” Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event will feature performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy charity event for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of the comedians attending the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironically slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial themes W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show entitled Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, sometimes he walks through the alleyway between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Iran satisfied with process of nuclear negotiations
Iran, one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN Veto Powers and Germany, is pleased with the negotiating process.
"After years, we have reached an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game comrades with machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
Afterwards, they would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger she had taken with her was supposed to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the crime to the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
Among other reasons, the elder mentioned a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth facility.
Prostitute must go to jail
For exploitative trafficking, harassment, threats, insults and dangerous bodily harm, the District Court of Constance has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
According to him, in five cases, he met women via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent off against their will after a few weeks.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women, some of whom had been buying for him for years.
By confiscating cell phones and SIM cards, he cut off contacts of women with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored in order to control their income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he suffered a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan alongside him were killed in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about the mental limitation and thus a limited guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any of the injured women anymore.
According to a police officer, at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking were detected after an initial complaint by telephone surveillance measures.
The conversations were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had detected bruises all over the body, has so far made no statement.
It is a “completely broken personality” that sees violence and exploitation in this field as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He left these circles and wanted to live a normal life after detention," he said.
Oil price continues to fall to $96 per barrel
The oil price has also continued to fall on Friday after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude grade for deliveries in December fell late in the morning in Europe in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has strained prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the US supply had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was evidence of stronger demand from two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery of China’s economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude oil also used by US refineries, fell by 26 cents at the ICE Exchange in London to $108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on NYPD stop-and-fresh policy
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked a judge’s order demanding changes to the New York Police Department’s stop-and-fresh program, and released the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Judge Shira Scheindlin’s decisions would be suspended until the city’s appeal was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the program for arresting and interrogating people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its policy and the corresponding training program.
The appeals court heard the arguments for the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people for inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the stop-and-fresh program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including policy, training and service oversight reforms, and ordered a pilot program with body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released again after a police check.
An oral hearing to appeal the city is scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-fresh tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have existed in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the term of Mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities filed a lawsuit, which evolved into a collective lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s stop-and-fresh program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police agencies use the regulation.
Opponents believe the changes would dampen the morality of the police, but not crime; nor would money be wasted and the wider problem of a police force that has been under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it is not ending the stop-and-fresh practice, which is constitutional, but merely reforming the way the NYPD implements controls.
The happiness of dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels manage to reach
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first chairman Henne reported extensively on the work of the association.
He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the missions were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the actions mentioned.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to act at the association in an advisory function.
In 2008, the carpentry company Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the infirmary in Socogim, a misery district on the outskirts of the capital - voluntarily in the record time of almost a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the maternity clinic is to be rationalized away in Nagold.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, according to Henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many physicians came to Germany to hospitalize in various areas.
In addition, containers of material are regularly shipped to Africa, such as medical devices, medicines, dressings, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered ample local colors by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motives, he cited his work in the field of accounting as a young MP.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that the global economy also demands global humanity.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It is not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and pursued them, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
“In the prosecution’s opinion, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is no one who stands in front of people’s homes hoping to catch them on fresh act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said NotW uses three procedures to research stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, surveillance, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies that, but we say, “And if he knew.”
Rumors about Clarke’s affair were first picked up by NotW’s feature editorial when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was told, “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A tape of voicemails from her phone on at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
As the research was underway, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following: "I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities on this story followed the same pattern as those of other major figures, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Blunkett over an affair with a married woman when he was linked to co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned Reichssteuer, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends with no result.
In the conflict over the Reichssteuer, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed arbitration meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of associations and associations at the Elysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare football from the planned 75% tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side also remained tough.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried out, said the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The match days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are scheduled between 29 November and 2 December.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and contribute ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The flood, which hit Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009, was a striking event that raised the question of safeguards for the future, Häußler said.
A river area survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The goal is to protect as many built-up plots as possible," says Häußler.
The basis is the planning of the protection against a flood that is to be expected statistically every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In specialist circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said Häußler.
In order to achieve HQ 100aKlima protection, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality expecting state grants of around 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out, however, that funding only exists if an overall concept is implemented.
For this purpose, the municipality is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval process must be completed.
At best, implementation can begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the influx of the Irm river from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and restraint basins were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interplay of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, one is supposed to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
There was resentment among residents of the old town, who have to suffer from an overload of the canal network even in normal thunderstorms.
The problem is well known in the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for sewer systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that two- to three-year rainfall events could be tolerated.
Larger sewers would swallow millions.
Severely Injured After Collision
In the early afternoon of Friday, two motorists were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could not say much at first about the accident.
However, there are several witness statements that should be evaluated first.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both cars collided, with the woman so heavily trapped that it took the firefighters almost half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both victims were taken to nearby hospitals.
The track was completely closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Astonishing the kinship on the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the inventor and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite relevant in his own country.
Some titles have been published in Heyne Verlag, which distributes the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories Two Thousand One.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, security delusion and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, he had drugs in his brain.
He realized, early on, that calculators are divinities.
He wrote a theology of computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minorities Report" dates back to 1956, it emits the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
The principle of "pre-crime" is developed here, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick’s world, which resembles ours terribly, mutants look to the future – and the police attack.
“We’re tracking individuals who haven’t violated any law,” the agency’s chief said.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, for that we have a prison camp full of criminals".
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick’s narrative works like the blueprint for the NSA’s anti-terror laws and eavesdropping.
Anticipation of the attack: That’s how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system is going crazy.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only does he accept mistakes and sacrifices, but he builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth.
Angela Merkel to testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. affair about Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German prosecutor’s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in Russia in person, the agency Interfax reported.
Previously, the Greens MP Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On the orders of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German internal intelligence service, he should photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use opportunities of foreign espionage “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a former whistleblower, began releasing his full horn of U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure they can take the floor.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency is spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has acquired data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia over state surveillance to a new peak.
The barrel overflowed the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been whipped, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then corporate management are certainly potential targets.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany has to wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now poses almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in the documents leaked by Snowden, there was no evidence so far that the US has passed on the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn’t have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and agriculture.
Everything, except for the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of the U.S. spy authorities uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spying risk in China.
In cloud computing, a major change is taking place because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to local jurisdiction and is therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after revelations about U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-U.S. members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s Deputy Managing Director, said: “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they stay physically in this area of law?”
Many German business leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore must be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
That's always been the case.
“It was a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Management usually does not brag about the countermeasures they have taken, as this provides advantages to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been blurred into saying that taking a free USB stick with them at a trade fair or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member at Audi, says that it has been the standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting, so that they can not be used as eavesdropping devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BAT warns in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in February the US National Intelligence Estimates ranked France, Russia and Israel behind China in second place of the countries that used the hacking to obtain economic data.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month as saying, “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Fair gives answers to wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake,” said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding party succeeds, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
They represented important providers around a wedding.
One trend: the retro look has re-emerged.
It starts with wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the dresses are often equipped with embroidery and are closed, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end up in a tow.
However, as Stefanie Koch of the fashion house Kleidermüller emphasizes, the ghosts differ.
For men, the suit with vest and plastron dominates, but cream-coloured or brown combinations can also be chosen.
It was important to choose the location, it was said.
Jewelleryless adjacent rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remise.
If you want to drive in the carriage, you have an offer for your link.
"But carriages are also popular for young girls' farewells," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" is becoming increasingly fashionable - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably like waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many other details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a wizard, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successfully
For the first time, the athletes of dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the Beginner class and secured fifth place, and with 15-month-old Marley he made it to 12th place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp with her Woody in class 1 faced the critical glances of the performance judge.
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teenager's parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestler mat in his high school gym, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found in an upright mat behind the grandstand in the school gymnasium on January 11.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubted it.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson’s lawyer, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff had concluded.
"They believe that it lacks any logic, violates the laws of physics as well as common sense," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being concealed in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he commented.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions remain unsolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, no matter in which direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson had died from the consequences of “position-related suffocation.”
However, a second autopsy revealed another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will commission the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s Office was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos that investigators had reviewed.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video recordings contained clues about how he died.
CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the EpiPen brand auto-injection is most commonly used – in order to be able to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently changed the regulations to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it,” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “sex indefinitely”
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with non-unique genitals.
Newborns are no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
According to the new law, parents are no longer required to declare gender for such children, but can indicate "indefinite" or "unspecified" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding surgery for gender allocation in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group diagnosed with “sex differentiation disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaires or testicles), or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well-developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend that you use the best available information on gender allocation, if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding, if any, on surgery.
New York-based psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening illnesses that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
One could make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity at all is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transgender or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but determined by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were demonstrated in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or “third sex” on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, was recognized as the world’s first “genderless” person after a court granted lifelong retention of an “undetermined” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will in future have a third allocation, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French deputies from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition asking for the “gender theory” to be removed from textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, stating: “If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she would be better off assigning a gender to babies at birth.
“Parental life is stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your child,” she told the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, medicine viewed gender as something that could be eradicated and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of surgery are being questioned, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels as they grow up with the gender they are assigned to.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
If such a child was born, then you did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with non-unique genitals originates from Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental offenses—how parents educate a child—interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, defining whether a person considered himself male or female.
However, in a case known as "John/Joan" in 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off by a pustuous circumcision to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex surgeries have come to the public who are "not happy with the result".
Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana author who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic surgery.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical files.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for the development of the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called the Interface Project for intersex people to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law could “encourage stamping and stigmatizing”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a ‘uncertain’ to the child,” she said.
We fear that this will encourage intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait.
But we do not yet know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she said.
The German law is about allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to which young children should be forced at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburg breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorises" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room so that they don't have to make decisions in a hurry," Baratz said.
It gives them time to take various tests and clarify things, giving them time to write "male" or "female".
In this way, everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don’t have to rush into an operation that can’t be undone.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are overwhelming because they feel they are not doing the right thing,” she said.
Ultimately, the child decides the gender that best suits him – and that’s wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Unknown injured girl by gunshot from car
Unknowns have injured a twelve-year-old in a shooting from a car in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children with an air-pressure weapon on Thursday evening in Genthin.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left calf.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also fired at a bus stop.
A slice broke.
Then they drove off.
Police are investigating, they said on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection in Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and immediately removed the egg remains, no property damage should have occurred.
In addition, some Sylvester bulls were probably also ignited in the city area, but no property damage has occurred here.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his bicycle trimmings were taken away.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his bicycle trimmings in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to take any further action.
Living with a future perspective
Waltraud Ries actually lives fantastically.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree population, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"You're hopefully not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing at a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself for a while now.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the worry of being unable to cope with the many stairs to the house and the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition: Since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifty-year-old has had to experience on her own body what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, a book of hers has been published on the topic 'Happy living in old age - What kind of living is the best for me?'.
“Our apartment is the best example of what can’t be done in old age,” she begins to tell.
When she moved to the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the greenery.
Today, at mid-fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deals with the issue of 'living in old age' at all.
Most people displace it as long as they can.
Only the others get old," she says smiling.
It is only when the pressure of suffering is really great that one thinks.
“It may be too late,” Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in old age.
"Whatever type of living you choose is always an individual decision," she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford to retire in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language, one can also find oneself in Dolce Vita,' says the author of the book.
Among their models are classical care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited retirement flat.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and quirks
'For me, such a shared home would be nothing,' she says with a wink.
Certainly not like in a student flat with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you just need your retreat rooms,' Ries says.
However, the author does not want to rule out the possibility that a senior residential community can still work.
However, this would have to be different than in the classical student-WG.
“Sometimes you just want your peace,” she says.
With that opinion, at least in the state capital, she is not alone.
'Most elderly people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the citizen service Life in the age of the state capital.
Your department advises people on the topic of 'getting older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often also accept inconveniences and restrictions only to be able to stay in their usual environment, this is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that everyone who is concerned with the age-appropriate renovation of their house or apartment should first get thorough information and not hire the first-rate craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate renovation.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is just the toilet seat elevation, the interior designer clarifies.
But not always the existing apartment can be redesigned age-appropriate and therefore barrier-free, even if it is still beautiful.
This was the experience Waltraud Ries had to make.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the also paved path to the apartment door would be the much larger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, she grays more than before the spider at her apartment door.
US wants to prosecute Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He is accused of unlawfully disclosing secret information.
Therefore, he had to face criminal proceedings in the United States, said US State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Snowden’s recent statements would not change that either.
Previously, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbeles’ statements were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German member of the government.
Intelligence secret agent Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, he wants to clarify his situation.
The former NSA employee sought by the United States made this clear in an unaddressed letter that Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the federal government, the Bundestag and the federal attorney general.
The letter, according to a translation distributed by Ströbele, is worded as follows:
To the Competent
I was asked to write you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to be a contracted or direct technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which led me to act out of a moral duty.
As a result of publishing these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world, as well as senior officials – including the United States – have judged the disclosures to an all-encompassing surveillance system that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These spying revelations drew many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously concealed misuse of public trust.
The benefits for society from these insights are becoming increasingly clearer; at the same time, the risks accepted have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of allegiance and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States government, with the support of the international community, will dismiss this degrading attitude.
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and lawfully.
I look forward to having a conversation with you in your country once the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.

Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in Gartenstraße has been sold to a private person.
The city council approved the sale in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier emphasizes.
In the budget, 100,000 euros were allocated.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking for the garden and clearing the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier rejoices.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a square concert on the terrace of the inn Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked everyone who had helped to successfully cope with the first music shock.
Obama campaign considers replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The unveiling is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and it reported on Thursday evening that the president’s top advisers had conducted “extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011” to see if it would look better for Obama’s dwindling hopes of re-election if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times’ national political correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts by leading campaign and White House officials, including former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect on poll scores of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House chief advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew about the proposed change.
"Double Down" claims Daley had been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her "close, personal relationship" before finally opting out of such a move after data showed that Clinton's candidacy would "not significantly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government was actually considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I put out a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the president had terrible poll scores at the time, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what are we doing?”
While Daley called the investigations “due diligence,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out if such a move paid off in terms of the ballot boxes.
“Campaigns don’t spend so much money on surveys and focus groups unless you think seriously about something,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe the president was “conscious” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political investigations had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thinks Obama didn’t know about the investigations on whether to drop Biden in the elections.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
What happens on the go with my email?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
In the design of the Internet service, was e-mail similar to the traditional postal service technically implemented the letter secret?
In the conception of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Consequently, the basic technical protocols did not take care to provide a stable foundation for a sound exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds more to an open postcard than to a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, Anna’s email program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are traditional emails being read along the way?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots on the go.
The sender’s provider usually checks whether the mail has a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam email that is immediately deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place contextual advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google may display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people read the emails?
The likelihood of unauthorized people reading an email is extremely low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal means to intercept or take notice of emails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from co-reading?
With OpenPGP standard encryption, an email can be effectively encrypted against co-reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to obscure the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany?
According to an August 2013 investigation by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mostly privately used mailboxes.
While Yahoo Mail’s shares had recently fallen, Google’s GMail was able to increase significantly.
Mother hiding in the woods and receiving pension
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowance.
In order to continue to receive pension and care allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after investigations by the police.
First, he covered the death of the 89-year-old, then he had the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
Accordingly, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time it was noticed that no medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
The retiree told the investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had been living in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had taken care of them last.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother’s death.
According to the police, an autopsy did not reveal any evidence of a capital crime.
Want ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing ice cream in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous treat from them.
The idea came to him after he read a research paper on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists to manufacture the luminous protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in your mouth and lights – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of Lick Me I'm Delicious, says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, so you get two grams of it for <0xC2><0xA3>200."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice lights up.
We’ve been testing it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to put it on the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that, it tastes delicious.
Based in Bristol, Charlie’s experimental company is famous for its unusual flavours, which include beer, cheese, beef, and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is in and of itself impossible because of the light refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I guess we find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
After six days of playing, the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Verbandsliga.
The team of Ingo Ehlers is coming to the derby tomorrow against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season begins again for us.
"I hope we finally have our heads free," Ehlers says with optimism.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his complete squad at his disposal.
Daverden, like us, is also on pace play.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase the coverage, which has left everything but a sure impression.
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was a house number.
But that’s why we’re far from being the favorite, because in the derby, anything can happen.
However, Panitz now wants to reconvene in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
Joost Windßuß, who is active with the A-Jugend Bundesliga club HC Bremen with a double-playing right, is celebrating his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, get up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I’m more of a Halloween muffin.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and probably will not do so this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans — 158 million, to be exact — are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and decorations, according to the U.S. Retailers’ Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exhilarating inanimate objects are the last scream.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive foods such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect lots of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk spacemen will make it to the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone with it to my surprise.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
That’s a lot of “hot dogs.”
When it comes to sweets, we are not shy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candy and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, walk through the neighborhoods saying “sweet or sour.”
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not fool ourselves – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is sugary candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Candy Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It’s a mystery I haven’t solved yet.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, America Haunts says, and that includes the wonderful photos that you just pee in your pants and then put the friends on Facebook where you can't get rid of them again, and then the guy you're standing for leaves a comment like "nice expression."
But let’s finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from an early age.
Fortunately, the “Baby in the Pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Home fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces recover charred corpse
The fire brigade had to leave Helmbrechts late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the county courtyard catches fire in the night of Friday.
The rescuers rescued a charred body from the house.
Rescuers have found a charred body in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
By late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firefighters arrived, the flames were already striking out of a window.
The police went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room were completely burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible parishioner shortage: The Evangelical Lutheran State Church Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 according to the current situation.
For today's young people, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in a conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day-to-day routine yourself.
With Burfien, the state church commissioned for the first time a full-time pastor to inspire young people to study theology.
At the moment, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churchization: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but for this, theologians would have a safe employer.
This meets the young people of today, who are not only concerned with career, but with a meaningful job.
According to the state church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology degree offers a broad education.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
Options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with Bowler Works mechanics and logistics support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as an accessible path to world-class events.
We are delighted to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the hardships and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it’s going to be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day in February at the Defender Challenge, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters called to rescue a puppy trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous promontory in a quarry
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her miserable position.
Firefighters sailed off the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The firefighters managed to bring a puppy to safety, trapped on a 15-metre-high projection in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel dog Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for her missing bitch and posted calls for help on social networks when she escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker running his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and sailed off to rescue Ruby, who was then transported upstairs in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
She didn’t move any muscles during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate some dog cakes.
This was a rather unusual operation.
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a giant luck.”
There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her back in my arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never hit Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had worked as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old dryer, and that "he dragged on me when I was 18".
She added: “That was a long time ago and he was very kind to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he has ever attempted to approach Katy Perry."
He added: “Perhaps she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singer-songwriters who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" landed at No. 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European detachment gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire-secured border along the Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would result in more freedom of movement in the rest of Europe, but this – as expected – did not matter in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favorable for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued disregard for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
Actually no story.
And one that has come so far in years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I heard the “independence means passport control” duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, made after the war, has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Across the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a single currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded only this year – was able to win almost five million votes in the German parliamentary elections in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis is a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the forced jacket, in which the respective national economy is forced by the adherence to the single currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and German politicians would like to let that happen.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only option is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind the current budgetary and monetary problems.
As a result of the “green” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All the world’s wage fixings do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is stirring up, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France’s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany at bay and to raise Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe into its own economic policy, with which the fraught French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-hostile Front National has just won a decisive by-election and thus sent the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right-wing spectrum would automatically bring benefits to the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I would like to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of pleasing the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final consequence) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including saying to Berlin and Brussels what they can put where.
I suspect that Scotland could do quite well in a loose European union if we kept our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and undertaken) cuts blamed on Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to have austerity policies imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that puberty is coming quickly,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair, as well as body odor, appear in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the occurrence of the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it will take at least two to three years to menarch," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually constitutes the onset of puberty, but it applies “early” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progress, tests by an endicronologist may be indicated so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defending against another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to inhibition of growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about drugs, but he admits: “Suppressing puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and girls’ feelings of being different from their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter got her days at the age of ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media would be the cause.
Boys, like girls, enter puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine, which establishes a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate and genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow facial and pubic hair early, the trend towards full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders
Leading aircraft manufacturers have had a dispute over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, indicating the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always the ones that airlines strive the most for, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing aircraft.
Airbus called for an industry standard this week that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. arch-rival Boeing says that should be decided by the airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the stated economic results that the new “mini jumbo” design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" can accommodate 406 people in tourist class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing for 10 per row.
Airbus says the competing version of the A350 will transport 350 passengers in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Airplane giants often distribute hits about technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Now, before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders, Airbus is appealing directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and showed donors a picture of three people sitting squeezed together in a restaurant, with the title: “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo props,” said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
Faced with changing dietary habits, people are getting fatter, but airplane seats haven’t radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by ten percent, according to U.S. Department of Health data.
The waist circumference of the average male American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival sticks to a 1950s seating concept when the average body circumference of the newly-baptized “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have shown that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus’ figures on seat dimensions, saying it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines shape the balance between airfares and facilities.
The company also explains that, according to research, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do to be successful,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s cabin expert.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the dispute lies a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance sheet of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than that of machines currently in use with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s suggested that many passengers opted for the narrower arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper airfares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offering is driven by the threat posed by the 777,” said Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin fittings, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet vendors even carry tape gauges to measure the facility against the competition.
Even though they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but hasn’t sold one yet.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to fade, but could be distracted by the wave of 777X sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Stop Smoking Pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Tests on humans require further trials, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and tried all the methods available on the market, but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information needed to make nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a “timeout,” the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if he was absolutely sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
However, it is more likely that smokers would use it to quit.
“They know then that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure in doing so because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them get rid of the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labour minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales is being investigated by the state’s anti-corruption agency.
The former NSW minister denies having changed maritime lease regulations at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings on three properties on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Obeid influenced various ministers of state to extend leases at Circular Quay, where Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without extending tenders after their expiration in August 2005.
Now it is being investigated over the allegation that Tripodi had known of Obeid’s covert interest in the properties after Tripodis’ former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole testified accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer runtimes.
In 2009, the lease agreements for the companies at Circular Quay, which earned the Obeds $2.5 million annually, were renewed without public tender.
Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally opted for public tenders.
But he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged a restructuring of the government’s lease regulations.
A telephone record submitted to the ICAC showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Ministry of Ports after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the topic discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of the commercial lease arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” Tripodi replied.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn’t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official told Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “authenticity test”
The government is considering a "authenticity test" for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of extended measures.
If the test were to be introduced, it would use a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for family and friends to move to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was published today after former Labor MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments regarding foreign workers because they could be viewed as insulting by Australia’s neighbors.
“Sounding statements like ‘foreigners should be behind’ and ‘australians to hire first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region echoed this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures once devised by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday at talks on human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the ‘authenticity criterion’ is adopted, the applicant for a visa could be checked for ‘authenticity of the application in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking’.
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after in the past, companies that initially only wanted to support a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week on a refugee boat.
The distraught nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia has been cared for since his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as the start of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was delighted to be working with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed highway between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings tremendous benefits.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unambiguously" advocate Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail link holds the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland’s economic strength also provides an argument for high-speed rail links across the UK.”
That is why we are delighted to be working as a partner of the UK government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and deciding on the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones on take-off and landing, despite efforts in the U.S. to loosen the regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch, or play videos on their devices during critical phases of flight, provided they are in “flight mode”.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian airlines are observing the decision, which US airlines have to do a lot of work to implement, but do not have any immediate plans to change their regulations.
CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight in Australia continue to apply.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft," it said.
The subject is subject to regulations that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights, saying that it is open to change, but that it must be initiated by lawmakers.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it will stick to the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices may not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not currently have any plans to change that,” the company said in a statement.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and we will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects U.S. companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate mobile interference, and modify manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the devices during landing.
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, travelled BVB trailers with lightning missiles had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund has faced severe consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - at first.
It was an unfamiliar, almost ghostly acoustics that offered the viewer until just before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
The guest fans were mostly heard with their songs.
The South Tribune, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no chants, no battle cries.
The pedestal of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common cheering, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the stands, there was a large flag blasting solitary with the words "Stadion prohibition section".
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, entered the field as the first BVB player, did short-term cheers burn up.
When his teammates followed, there were loud singing and blowing scarves - but far from everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune.
Norbert Dickel, the stadium spokesman, once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a celebration mood.
Only five minutes before the start, the capo climbed its pedestal - and the tension, which until then was almost tangible with hands, unleashed in a loud scream, when Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
Lastly, as always, it was the turn of the South Tribune - and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium was again here.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derby winner stands up" came out with a whistle from the South Tribune, everything was again as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the accompanying BVB trailers had fired light rockets into the spectator ranks and onto the pitch - and almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller met.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if Watzke's words are believed, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I banned it," he said.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras were shown various ways of punishment - by Tuesday, they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"This is going to be drastic," Watzke assured.
One can be curious how the reactions on the South Tribune will then turn out.
Pfandhäuser boom in Singapore as crisis arrives in middle class
In a pawn shop in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there’s all my money in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 each month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand is so high in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – that ValueMax, where it made its swap, became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pledged jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 in Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pledge houses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent required by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
Pfandhäuser, however, offer the advantage that there is no credit check or income proof required here, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
That’s why millions of people in the region are turning to pawn shops as families feel the pressure of rising cost of living as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economies, low- and middle-income families seek out mortgage houses to make up the difference in stuttering economy.
This week, the Standard & Poor’s rating agency described rising household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks’ creditworthiness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have intensified the trend of pledged personal items as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items pledged in the city-state’s 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say, “The gold price looks good, let’s pledge Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent customer growth in its stores over the past few months.
Growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, operating the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four homes – but also outside of Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is funding this with 60 percent of the $66 million Singapore raised this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders were caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that mortgage houses not only offered cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
"Customers lend items they already own, and the liquidation of personal valuables does not increase the budget deficit," she explains.
The mortgage lease business is increasingly accepted by society as a short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use mortgage loans are in financial difficulties.
Wealthy people from Singapore also come to ValueMax’s stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
“This includes wealthy people who lend something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses that need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks,” says Yeah.
Sometimes you just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Intelligence revealer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany solve the ever-increasing NSA spy business.
According to the Greens MP Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence officers would testify at a German prosecutor’s office or before an investigation committee.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over $325 million for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the $325 million Australian health care bailout to ensure the state’s government can’t waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system limitations.
Funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has drawn up an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said in a statement.
The $325 million package includes $31 million emergency aid for electoral services.
A further 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments for cataracts, are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-hospital care, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state would need to maintain its current level of funding in order to receive funds from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “they were not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the prime minister in early May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a big contribution to removing the state's public health system from the worry list," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these election benefits will largely offset the recent cuts.
But the opposition’s health policy spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes today’s announcement is just a “patch solution.”
“We are in the current situation because the Labor State government has withdrawn $430 million from the healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
It can’t be that a state government is ripping nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and putting 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretending to be good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier food than necessary.
Set in France in the 1760s, the story tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of another's erotic fascination.
The film never drifts into lust or sensationalism – and that’s its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a painful penitent shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons and gas ammunition manufacturing facilities, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group said on Thursday, while serious clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on
November 1, which the Hague-based organization Damascus had set up to destroy or make "inoperable" all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin to destroy the weapons and supplies available.
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say there is a chemical weapons production facility and deposits, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which tracks the number of dead in Syria via a network of activists, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad's army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have connections to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not give any details.
The fights underline the danger to which chemical weapons inspectors are exposed, as their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is “now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and witnessed their destruction.”
Therefore, “there are currently no further inspection activities planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been abandoned, according to Syrian statements, “and the chemical weapons program objects present there had been relocated to other listed facilities that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I take the hat off to the bravery and courage you all have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” Ahmed Uzumcu, the director-general of the surveillance organization, said in a comment published by the OPCW.
For three years now, in this civil war, mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting against Assad’s government and its security forces, which include many members of the Alawites, to segregate Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a strong explosion at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over sentence for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict for the last of the instigators, who was brought to justice because, according to them, Umar Patek was to be legally shot.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
With a suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder over the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A conviction was also issued in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had demanded a life sentence, even if they could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also known as a "demolition man" because of his reputation as a master bomber.
The decision has evoked painful memories for June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Struggling with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him in front of a firing squad,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with every day that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was leveled when a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while hanging on to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To keep him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't stand," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict was issued before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which is being celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not make cell phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies from departure to landing, but not phone with their mobile phone, according to the new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated flight crew training manuals and equipment storage regulations in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not restart it until the aircraft has reached an altitude of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing approach, the passengers must turn it off again and may not start it again before the plane has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even during take-off, landing and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Flight Assistant Association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit,” Glading said.
We are honestly tired of having to feel like guardians on this issue.
However, internet connections for browsing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers remained prohibited, the agency explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still not “Words With Friends,” the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to publicly leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gateway.
And heavier devices such as laptops still have to be stored, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices on take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a security expert on national traffic issues, told CBS News that mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they could potentially cause interference to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission towers,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow for a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies say that up to one-third of passengers forget or ignore the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air passengers in 1966, after reports of interference of navigation and communication devices by passenger-carried VHF radios became known, representing the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that they don’t mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years now when the flight altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal radiation when flipped over.
But when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
One of the advocates of easing restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and took a test flight to identify problems, but were unable to detect them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes the interference from the equipment is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only occasional reports of pilots speaking for a malfunction of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the passengers to turn off the equipment when instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adaptation for travelers who would now be extensively equipped with technology.
“We are delighted that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rescued bird released by air rescue service from North Sea drilling island
An air-rescue flight to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The water rally was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was picked up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water rally was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: “He couldn’t fly on, so we were contacted with the request for help.”
Upon her release, the water rally was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide wealth and work in the UK want to change our relationships with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among UK business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives, representing approximately the UK’s corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while countries in the EU are stagnant.
They want the government to favor new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, instead of stopping by the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
When asked about certain legal issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, as companies said the costs of Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with the one that is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this probably says the most, our survey of business leaders revealed that a significant majority of the UK wants a course to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, which is found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings the book of action back to the UK.
A change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: this survey shows that the UK economy is behind his plan for renegotiating the UK's conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show, which means for companies a greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom board of directors.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which the bulk of Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk on conventional routes, as officials can hear.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “forever” eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates if the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other sub-countries will begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, no road leads past the real estate location in Germany.
The economic framework data is correct, and the financing options are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th Real Estate Day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and good economic conditions in the country in comparison with Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out this on the 9th Real Estate Day of the Stock Exchange Newspaper.
How sought-after German commercial real estate is, the view on the volume of transactions, says Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate," Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Royal Commission Hearing: Two YMCA Employees Accused of Sexual Offences Against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA staff members from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged with sexual offences related to children before 2011 charges were brought against caring nurse Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, according to the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
However, at the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that it had "never had to do with an incident of sexual abuse of children in the organization."
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about one case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of abuse of entrusted children in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, a commission assistant attorney, that he knew about the first case, but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that “there have been external reviews of the YMCA, recognising the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety.”
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of that year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the management failed “from me downwards” in hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Earlier this year, Lord had been convicted of sexually assaulting 12 boys during his two-year service to the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that had prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations regarding children’s safety.
Employees said they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, caring for her privately as a babysitter, letting her sit on his lap, telling one he loved it, and letting children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that child care supervisor Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior Lords at the YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and very inaccessible most of the time”.
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not dare to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had rather impaired their judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare explained that he had informed the YMCA NSW Board of Directors of his view that the lesson the organization had to learn from the “Jonathan Lord incident” was “not reporting” by employees, and the Board of Directors agreed.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations occurred had been made by YMCA Children’s Services Director Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent the contamination of the evidence, which was "excessively" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in hiring, reviewing, introducing, training and supervising employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would use the chance to return as British prime minister, but admitted that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked if he would like to return to the office of prime minister, Blair was quoted by London’s Evening Standard as saying, “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that will happen, so...”
When the horse show experts came to Cardiff in crowds to select the horse of the year, they were aware that a fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland pony toffee walked loosely through the three laps and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in handling the pony far beyond his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his performance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day ever since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and toffee are a great team.”
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and went off the pitch with a gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over a decade.
Howells said, “The whole audience was like electrified and everyone cheered on him and clapped.”
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to care for.
The way he started it won’t be long before he’s on the “Horse of the Year” show – and I’m sure he’ll do well.
A spokesperson for the annual horse show said, “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee on how well they had beaten themselves and presented in the screening ring.
They watch for good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s cute clothes did their part, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after appeal
A Chinese newspaper, which had on the front page called for the release of a reporter who had been charged with defamation, should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he accepted bribes to forge reports about a state-owned company.
Now the New Express is undergoing a “comprehensive rectification,” the regulator said.
The "Rectification Order" was issued by the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator said in a statement.
She said it had decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter license.
"Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a full rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant officers of the New Express be identified and immediately check the management team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper posted two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports in exchange for payment.
"In this case, I damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public trust," he told CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized that I was doing the wrong thing.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express posted an apology on the front page, stating that they had failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a law change earlier this year that banned authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with own railroad between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be unrecognised in it, authorities said.
The discovery of the tunnel secured eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the court’s records.
Three men who worked as drivers were charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which challenges drug cartels to get their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passage with rails running from a kitchen in a Tijuana home to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways in the future.
However, in an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are two-year-old Flynn’s parents.
Orlando Bloom has announced his separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was scheduled to air on Friday, Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old emphasized.
"We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism is subordinated to vegetarianism, according to Lexica, but it is quite different from this in a very significant way.
While vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these tastings are not on a vegan’s menu.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan abstains from all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.
What remains, one may wonder, but on closer examination, the vegan diet world is characterized by considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
The native New Zealander has been living vegan for 13 years, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs for life. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
Around the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers synthetic leather to normal leather.
He realized that in other everyday matters, too, there are no animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor proclaims the vegan maxim, which extends to the entire consumption behavior.
Instead of grieving after burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan does not represent a waiver, an asceticism, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that with the change in diet, you reduce the choice of eating options, Proctor is more likely to rely on the power of habit.
And it is precisely these conditionings that have caused some well-intentioned attempts to fail.
“The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that prompts many to give up quickly, similar to smoking,” Proctor writes.
And you say, "Some tastes are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste delicious once in a while.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, which is legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but that's not just to reduce to animal food," Proctor said.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the transition had a positive aspect.
I do not take in any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood counts are fine, I get checked often," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many vegan simus critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat purchased in the refrigerator," Proctor says.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 levels are fine," he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, basic food is everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I find everything I need on the spot.
From time to time I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is also the case with "ordinary" finished products."
However, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed.
"There's a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few little tricks you can get good, if not partially better results," Proctor says.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecakes, Proctor was also able to amaze his in-laws.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
It has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new importance.
“The situations that can arise are as diverse as the people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, he was skeptical too.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - on such questions you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip sense.
"I don't reject people, I am part of this society," Proctor said.
And, more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many döner shops offer falafel, or even a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he avoids pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly adjusting to it.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If enough demands come, they may be inclined to complement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the kitchens in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are just the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, and in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a sure way to make the vast majority impossible from the outset,” Proctor says.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
Especially when one learns to understand that even in peanuts animal additives can be contained as coloring agents, one seems to quickly lose courage with the adherence to ethics in so many obstacles and traps.
Not only that, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to the food as well as cleaning agents.
Gradually, you develop a scanner look and know which signs and logos to look for. "It's sometimes better to take small steps than to stand or stumble," Proctor says.
Veganism, it is an important moral pointer that strikes at consciousness.
He may not quite manage to get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
The Nasdaq OMX stock exchange operator keeps its customers in the loop.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns at the stock exchange operator.
It was not until Tuesday that the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in a week alone.
Initially, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively flawed purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the exchange operators took almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all stock trading in the U.S. came to a halt for several hours due to a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq exchange.
Last year, Facebook’s IPO also caused a stir.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of purchase and sale orders, later the stock market regulator SEC noted and fined the company to a record $10 million fine.
Konstanz: Cyclists drive around 63-year-old
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, about 10 p.m., was riding a ladies’ bicycle on the left sidewalk from Bahnhofplatz towards Marktplatz.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped on the pavement from a local, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and contracted a 15 centimeter long square wound on the head.
An ambulance team took the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British Police Announce Extradition to Assange
The British police today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent the 40-year-old Australian a “invitation to face” calling for him to appear at a police station, and added that if he did not comply, he was threatened with arrest.
Assange is threatening to be extradited to Sweden over the charges of a sexual offence after his options under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected its appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
"Scotland Yard has sent a 40-year-old man an invitation to appear at a police station at a time we choose," a spokesperson said in a statement.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage allegations after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the disclosure website WikiLeaks.
Driver who hit his legs at 210 km/h with a hot drink receives <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 penalty
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at up to 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
In Colchester County Court, Howie pleaded guilty without being driven with the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a <0xC2><0xA3>100 victim surcharge.
Tax for foreign property owners against London’s speculative bubble
The Treasury Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a 7% stamp tax in the 2012 budget on homes that cost over two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold homes as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, revenue from the stamp tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, exceeds revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp tax on high-priced homes and the introduction of anti-evasion legislation, it is hard to argue that high-quality real estate is too low-taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“However, this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling,” he added.
Top-notch real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging “domestic market” in which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a Savills study.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between a dog’s tail wagging and his mood.
Earlier research had shown that happy dogs with their tails swayed more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right brains respond differently to stimuli that produce positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain is responsible for the movement of the left side, and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to their species’ lateral tail wedging, researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs films with dogs – either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise inexpressive dog moved the tail to the right (viewed from the perspective of the wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tended mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog waving), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not communicate intentionally with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and wagging the tail in one direction is more likely to be associated with friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce a less friendly behavior, then you react based on these experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their animal’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and guest fellow at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it’s a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria in Canada stated: “Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when its ‘tail’ is waving on the left rather than on the right, rather than getting restless – just the opposite than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore be that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior can be easily recorded, it will probably not take long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer contracted laryngeal inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was scheduled to play at Hydro on Friday.
Due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, however, the concert must now be moved.
The band’s announcement came after they had previously had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngeal inflammation, which is why he can’t appear.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this is the responsibility of a group of 120 “elective cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said there would be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the consistory, was held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible cardinals is likely to have dropped by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary for the number of eligible cardinals to return to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At present there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight Cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the pope decided everything alone.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He explained that it was “quite possible” that Francis should ask the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation – this is all completely new.
Valero said that bishops from large towns are typically called to be cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he’s appointing.”
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the US to repair seat backrest
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to address a manually adjustable seat back issue, the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulator said in a statement on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety with headrests.
"If the vehicle is hit from behind, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury," the message read on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading U.S. car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively impacted car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM stock rose by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation cry of an Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made praiseworthy efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics.
Blockade policy doesn’t apologize to Obamacare’s website problems, drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It’s a book that I thought would uplift me during the sad second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and depicts Barack Obama's memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I’m done with my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and took a speech away from my breath.
The election became a landslide victory and news speakers stopped to highlight the historical significance of that hour.
My classmates were crying for joy and my parents were collecting all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had an approval rating of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if you are being ripped out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague reminder, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has accomplished, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that the party-political blockade tactics have tilted too many aspirations to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public health insurance option, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But after I defended the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I ended up with my attempts at explanation.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The republican blockade policy cannot explain why one allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency is collecting data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished who disclose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.”
And most recently, it can’t excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that the government’s work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
Obviously, the MP’s office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre are shaping public discussion.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to have been largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012 not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and undisputed alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with Obama’s approval ratings falling below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through this book has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week, I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put in a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with the voters after the decision, he told his employees they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
“I want us to find our magic,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters get pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a court dispute over the payment of $6 million in carbon tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to remove or cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes in advance after the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process to make it faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the voting?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you march in, enter the data into a computer, dial immediately and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can then erase the results if you don’t like them?
Choosing pencils nowadays is incredible.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
A public office is about the service to the public.
“We do not aspire to any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, so two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly taking off.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in investigating the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is changing ownership every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the Libor interbank business scandal is causing.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigation into this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said.
Last month, people close to the situation reported that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a previous merchant to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is said to have been on leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Usher’s Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has upset traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low currency volatility limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks means that “one can influence the market even with very low ticket prices”.
The news came out the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader from its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained," Credit Suisse said in a statement.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle property
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss Meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and widened the footpath, it said in a press release.
The planned cover of the decaying house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for security reasons, because the site is threatening to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the embellishment action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
Prior to BI’s action, a banner with the message “We are for it” had been attached.
However, this did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the Citizens' Initiative in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins".
In this way, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the city's project will be better for many, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is delaying these answers further, BI says.
As was heard, the public statements of the mayor also have an effect.
May had said in the municipal council meeting that he feared the out for the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some people seem scared because of this, others feel it as a "crude blackmail attempt" on the population, BI says in the press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Sheltes for Schiris: Mane no Swallow King
As pleased as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed was the sports director of the "bulls" from the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Swallow Kings category," he defended the two offensive vortexes at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent reason for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane in the 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese turned into a supposed act of destruction - which, of course, was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"It was a gross mistake," Rangnick said, who described referee Harkam as "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot decisively: "I would have behaved in every single situation the same as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old stressed.
However, in view of the success of the race, Rangnick agreed to a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for that: really good," he stated.
There's not much to do.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
Let's keep it that way.
There will be hardly any changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Unless a player approaches with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick clarified.
Supreme Court approves Obama’s health law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- forcing U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 -- is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law, and also held that the provision of the Health Act that states would either have to expand Medicaid entry requirements or otherwise cancel all state Medicaid funding was not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been firmly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary campaign.
Norway: A Norwegian place makes itself light with giant mirrors
With giant mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their gloomy valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland shouted at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers took sun chairs, others put on sunglasses for safety.
Previously, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council had finally approved the 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella for several years.
Post hardly empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed, the red dots for the Sunday emptiness are still on various mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptiness no longer takes place on Sundays and public holidays," the FDP says.
A question from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld, Germany, is emptied.
Whether it will be emptied on Sunday in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's question.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to check this out.
The Sunday emptiness is an important postal service, especially at Terminpost.
"This thins out this enterprise despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 radically and unreasonably".
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals' group and city association, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that the vacancies are being changed or even deleted in hiding here".
The post office is miles away from the city.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck in unison.
The core city also applies, especially non-mobile fellow citizens should also be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying within walking distance.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament if the city administration is planning talks with the Post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
But as far as he knows, there is also a Sunday lessons in Hofheim.
Your party has been in favour of privatisations.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees should rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The magistrate of the city is discussing a proposal from traffic deputy Stefan Majer (Green) this morning.
Accordingly, the parking fees should be increased by 50 percent.
However, it is not intended to raise the prices, but to shorten the time interval of parking clocks and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The Retail Committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The parking facility directly in front of the store is “a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers.”
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions surprise hosts
With a narrow squad, the gentlemen of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen.
The <0xC3><0x84>lblers were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
However, it soon became apparent that they could not quite keep up with the rapid actions of the joy-cities, even due to age.
With the hard and placed spreads, the Gönninger were extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly through the net center and were not available in the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadters in all respects.
In view of this crushing and game-determining achievement, the third set was then won a bit lax and ludicrous to the 3:0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, with TV Baiersbronn, which clearly prevailed in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent will be on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a fiercely contested two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points gifts, especially in ball acceptance; also in the passes, the precision was sometimes lacking and in some critical play scenes, the overzealousness prevented the look for possible points wins.
In this performanceally very balanced encounter, however, Marcus Blasutto’s TSV team consistently agreed with the great physical dedication and a delightful commitment of both teams.
Nursing day at the small English hut
For the fifth day of care following the Natura 2000 project in Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cut free on this day in the area of the hut, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, referred to this area as the highlight of the gorge promenade, where the landscape provides the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between human beings and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to accentuate nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Conservation Department of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the far-sighted landscape corresponds with the goal of preserving the now greatly expanded old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections for species conservation.
Tribukait said she would not fail at this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous complement to the achievements of the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these various presentations, District Manager Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been cut in advance, the forest tractor is ready to be called up if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was to have a clear view at the viewpoint.
Köffler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the small town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior citizens policy, as well as its own municipal utilities can be described as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has yet registered.
The only candidate to succeed Mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate due to his age, has so far been the 46-year-old bank clerk and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which holds thousands of previous Nortel patents, filed an avalanche of lawsuits on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was outbid by him in the insolvency auction of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been charged with patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus hits the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are producing mobile phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and recently offered $4.4 billion.
After being outbid by Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s patent library.
"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," the letter said.
Rockstar is demanding a high level of damages from Google as it claims Google's patent infringement was intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt Sworn First Freely Elected President
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He made the oath before the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, whose seat is on the Nile and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been targeted sharply by the respective government since it was founded 84 years ago as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to applaud the new president, and unlike the presidential splendour of the Mubarak era, traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but of all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to the end.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wooden paneled chamber where he took the oath.
Later, Morsi drove to the University of Cairo, where he would give his inaugural address.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem, which he listened to in Habacht position.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the university's largest lecture hall with voice choirs of "The army and the people are one hand".
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, promising to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken over from the expelled head of state.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not before the parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberg Discotheque provides two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On this Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on tomorrow Saturday evening we will continue with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Worker falls from ladder: seriously injured
When replacing a defective outdoor sensor on Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating probe on the outside facade of a guesthouse.
As he climbed on the ladder leaning on the gutter, the ladder slipped away and the man plunged onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rapist in South Africa sentenced to life imprisonment twice
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced on Friday to twice life imprisonment.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died of the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Cana was found guilty of the crime earlier this week.
The act had caused horror across the country.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so appalling that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
During the trial, Kana had admitted to being in a bar with boys on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially suspected several perpetrators, but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rapes are almost everyday in South Africa: there are about 64,000 cases of sexual violence every year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the dark figure for sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV program "Galileo", the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker clarifies right at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham are the pork nests, turbo mast is not a good prerequisite.
So can ham, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains how the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and cloak, he enters the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach for the microphone.
Jumbo seen for strengthening at fast food in Waldshut
"Here I am working huge amounts," the TV makers are astonished, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 clubs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what matters when it comes to quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months of age.
TV at a high level?
Details such as the pH of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I'm looking forward to seeing what Roberto Blanco is doing," Jumbo said cynically.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But watching is still worth it.
The viewer sees that dismantling the clubs is still handcrafted.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing are visually reminiscent of a "submarine".
The trick: fir branches here in the smoke provide for the special taste of the Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feeding.
"It's really delicious," says the TV star's conclusion.
This will make it possible for all involved to live.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the internet?
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual profit before taxes between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million to $315 million in its earlier forecast.
If the current targets are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre made an 8% gain in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start to the second half, especially in the Australian and UK private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are well on track towards record year-on-year earnings before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earnings carriers.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Flight Centre’s recreational business in the UK was similarly successful, while business customers also spent less here.
The US business recovered compared to the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so profits for the full year are expected for the third year in a row.
Flight Centre's shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to take a stand-alone GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the auditing authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech last summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is "a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence," emphasizing that the GCSEs would become "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the class schedule, coalition circles say that comprehensive mathematics exams – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will likely encourage schools to schedule more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on real life problems, including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours will be presented this weekend at the Bürgerhaus.
Assessments were made on Thursday.
Once again, the local association W514 hosts this large exhibition.
Here breeders of the clubs in the district of Soest show their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobbyists their rabbits.
On Thursday, six award judges assessed the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
The visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals on the cages is appropriate.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place on Saturday at 2.30 pm by Mayor Hermann Arndt.
The Rabbit Show is open to all visitors on Saturdays from 10 a.m. and on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a lottery and a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blonde curls and performs for the first time with a new bubi head.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Dialogue Forum
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, October 21, in the Neues Museum of the Castle will be devoted to the theme "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of Lake Constance.
Johanna Rahner wants to discuss in the forum the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries and had relied on those images of heaven and hell that "have shaped our ideas to this day", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of completion would rather be characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been duly driven out by religious criticism," says the speaker.
She added: “We have so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have gone missing.”
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death."
This is connected with the question of that longing, "who dreams that in the end everything will be fine."
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
In 1997 she received her doctorate in theology, also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleiner Heuberg reaffirm their faith
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the Am Kleinen Heuberg pastoral unit have been confirmed.
The group Laudato-Si accompanied the service in the morning, in the afternoon of the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Sacrament of Confirmation, the young people said yes to their baptism and prayed for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the direction of the deacon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous parishioners, the firmmen had prepared themselves for the big festival.
In different projects they got to know various tasks of Christian community life and together experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race thrills participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the circuit over the hills around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Illmensee tells us.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
Both were able to leave the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advantage to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
In second place was again Pascal Treubel.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the Nightmare team that made it to the top of the winning ladder.
Second and third place were Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Fahrer from Owingen.
A pleasing development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years in the youngest to over 70 years in the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute top athletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to set off from the top regional drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-professional from the Black Tusk racing team.
Together with a team-mate, Pangerl was already twice world champion in the twelve-hour race.
This year he won the European Championship in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who has already named two German duathlon championships his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a lash finish in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Only a second behind, the routine player Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as third of the overall standings.
In the women's standings, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest timer in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized running of the event.
On the road through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is in the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to vote him as CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his ill father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain, causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," Bwelle commented.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and yet you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, in the United States, the ratio is one doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and provides free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into minibuses and drive with the corded medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be received as heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and swell – with its wide smile and limitless energy – is happy to join the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team then begins examining hundreds of patients.
“Per trip, we treat 500 people,” says Bwelle.
They come from a distance of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
Operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group’s generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It’s a strenuous curriculum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then drives back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free surgery of a hernia he had received now enabled him to work again.
“This will change the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his charitable work, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteers in Bwelle’s group.
He’s always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience they would never get at home.
“We can be in surgery where we can help drain blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a second year medical student.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
“He is undoubtedly a hero,” says O’Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier lives and thus fulfilling a promise he made to his father gives him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his craft, acting.
No one can fool the old man Santiago when fishing.
The two simply complement each other wonderfully.
It is almost believed to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago sits on the chair, tired of life, it’s real at Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is on stage for a long time as a solo performer.
He manages to focus the audience’s attention on himself, so that his monologues are not bored for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man in the boat act in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he brings to light the active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings with her songs and her glorious voice the Cuban way of life.
The four musicians play Cuban rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, a sewage channel from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne will not pass the cathedral.
The two towers rise 157 metres above the sky, making it the second tallest church building in Europe.
However, few visitors who marvel at the two filigree church towers suspect that there is a lot to discover underneath the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne underworld.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the Cologne-Tourismus Service Center directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore from the remnants of the old city wall only what was not too big remained.
Therefore, most users of the car park today also rush past the Roman remains and only park their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal lattice bars in the parking deck D2.
About five meters high ruins of hand-plate-sized stones can be seen.
"It is the remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century AD," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper level of the park take a look into a dark, 15-metre-deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is also hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the praetorium, and here the participants descend back into the depths.
We experience the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "City of Roman Law and City of Agrippinenses, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the praetorium is the former governor’s palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the anteroom of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewage channel, which is preserved here at a length of about 120 meters.
"You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After getting the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for ritual washings.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which construction work is to begin shortly.
However, a few years will pass until it is completed.
Leg Almost Cut Off: Reissue of Rocker Process
A bloody attack in the rocking environment is re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted homicide, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the district court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants remained silent to begin.
They are said to have been active in the rock scene and at the time belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecution accuses them of stabbing three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All the victims were seriously injured, one man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One of them was a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It was apparently preceded by a pursuit with several cars.
According to the prosecution, it was about territory fights and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman at the time said it had not been possible to prove that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators wore masks and had not been identified.
The Federal Court of Justice revoked the judgment after revision of the prosecutor’s office and referred it back to the district court for re-trial.
One of the defendants is currently on trial for another offence.
To begin with, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the evening.
As a witness, the then investigating commissioner was invited.
In the center were phone calls of the defendants and other people who had been intercepted by the police.
The difficulty is that rockers in court almost always stick to an iron law for them - and don't testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said on demand that new clues have emerged since the last trial.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the trial.
The disposable society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people in the front passenger and back seats, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What’s closer than going to the next drive-in to indulge in a little bit?
I admit, I like to be there when it’s late at night or early in the morning for fast food.
A couple of fries, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like off home and into bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers become noticeable.
After all, what is missing is that you constantly throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags lie on street edges and on parking lots.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It’s not just that the paper toys spoil the landscape.
Bags have also already concealed traffic devices such as guard rails and thus caused accidents.
But she doesn’t think about that, she probably doesn’t even know what that word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after swept through nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
There would be a few bags more or less but also nothing - unlike the street, where no one wants to step on the food leftovers of others.
I already see the day coming when the cities and communities will be too stupid to clear away - and the fast food chains will have to demand a pledge for their bags.
Obama's Retirement in Health Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama made a retraction yesterday in his often repeated, unambiguous promise: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands received a letter of resignation from their insurer, the Republicans accused the president in recent days of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep them," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports of the dismissals, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for new insurance.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
“They’re coming for a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as not surprising that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff, as their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans directly: they deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform had been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement of an upset Sebelius to a behind-the-scenes advisor at yesterday’s hearing in the House of Representatives was recorded after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri about whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long urged Sebelius repeatedly to ask why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced a state-funded insurance policy to settle a tariff on HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Jerusalem government fails to confirm attack on Syrian air base
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous on Thursday claimed to American news channel CNN that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
The target was “missiles and related equipment” which the Israeli government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah, CNN said.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been fired on from Wednesday to Thursday, and blamed the Israelis for it.
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia showing Russian S-125 Neva anti-aircraft missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which Channel 2 says have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quoted an also anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believes Israel carried out the attack, but is not sure.
An Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman said, “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, partly successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah in the past.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” followed by a military response.
John Kerry, in an unprecedented admission, said U.S. spying was “inappropriately going too far.”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, indicated a weakening of the U.S.'s defensive stance with respect to its surveillance programs, saying the espionage had in certain cases "goed inappropriately too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of outrage on the part of its allies.
During a video-transmitted speech at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “Without a doubt, the President and I and others in the government have learned of some things that have been done by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so existed, which dates back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course to 9/11.”
Subsequently, he was the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. spying had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too far.”
The President is determined to provide clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance operations.
He added, “We’re dealing with a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have heard of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. in anti-terrorist efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and other individuals this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organizations due to frustration over the surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, who is a Democrat for the first time in the Senate and chairs the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of intelligence this week said the reports were inaccurate and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited from documents passed on by Snowden, according to which the NSA had monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the espionage with allies as necessary, declaring that this was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his authority was preparing the trip of Congress to take place this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also spoke of the fact that there would be some “serious words.”
He said European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they have used for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the resentment about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is battling for a deployment of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do so individually.
"We will decide on his deployment in the short term," coach Thomas Tuchel said.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorer with six goals.
After all, the Mainzers already have to do without the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 for making a false statement after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were detaining her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had arrived safely at her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days until she confessed to having invented the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the spot.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player in the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Canberra State Department to ask for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
“Of course, we’re very worried, but we hope she’ll be home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and is on bail for a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she is taking a holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that after the recent assassination of travel merchant Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its bad tourist image, and therefore there is an acquittal.
