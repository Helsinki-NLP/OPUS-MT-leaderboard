Members of the Welsh Assembly worry they'll look like fools
There is consternation among some members of the Assembly about the proposal to change their title from AM's to MWP's (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of across the political spectrum are afraid that it could provoke a mockery.
One Labour Party member said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly and pwp means feces.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "receptive" to the name change, but noted that it was a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Assembly Members will, of course, be a matter for the Members themselves."
The Act on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received widespread support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Commission elected Welsh Parliament Members of WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AMs are apparently in the process of proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus could be a headache for chairman Elin Jones, who has to submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the meeting's working methods, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM's will get the final say in the question of what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was arranged in an effort to clear up a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for some time that the name of its neighbour in the north represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly abstained from its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop because churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historically speaking, the old people I talked to said there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
"Not one of them is there today."
He says that the disappearance of crows is understandable.
"People are socializing in other ways these days," he says.
"Crows are no longer the neighborhoods of family rooms where people regularly go."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from asset sales won't last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they're back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and will therefore bring the day that completely closes these churches even closer, because most of the people who move into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black community that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Honourable John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members were making plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Honorable David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical tool."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been happening at St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the church's lay leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council, the church's governing body, consisting of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will try to transfer the costs" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some members of the church complain about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injured 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster on the first day of the lobster season in California, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel says he at first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he's calling, 'I've been bitten!
I'm a bitch!"
"He's got his whole leg ripped open," Hammel saw when he came out of the boy's room.
"I shouted that everyone should come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Lifesaver captain. Larry Giles said at a media briefing session that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials have closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are battling with department store-type beauty walks manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and homeware decline, the larger beauty hallways in 11 stores across the country will be tested and if successful, taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty takes place as supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique masturbation range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more and more younger buyers are insisting on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller quantities of food purchased daily at local convenience stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe said the stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the discount stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which, according to their grocery sales, strengthened and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument about how to divide the profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold his 281 store pharmacy business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Commerce Director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty walks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands are designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons den-star Peter Jones ran away "furiously" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled her out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their home-wear and accessories brand name, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand name.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing from the show.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - focusing on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when TV's golden girl on Tuesday at a tense meeting at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she could no longer spend enough time on their homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand name and, according to insiders Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune, would have doubled.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones got on a jet and traded Britain for one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly, Holly was by far the biggest priority.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to remove her was absolutely dumbfounded by all involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow Headquarters ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning host, one of Britain's most cash-inducing stars, could drive the firm millions out of the pocket due to the massive investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and the possibility that its launch could face even more delays.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby teamed up with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard words "and then we fall in love"
He mocked the criticism he was going to get from the news media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "newsreader's voice."
"I didn't give up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first talk in June in Singapore as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have burned down.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, on Saturday, more than three months after the June leaders' meeting in Singapore, told leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "consistent response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. is proceeding with sanctions aimed at sustaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic approach in his speech.
"We are making great progress with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results -- ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and causing the rest of U.S. soldiers to be brought back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into 'this crowded arena,' we'd have nearly 200 people just standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Hurricane and earthquake in Indonesia devastate island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite to catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, which makes it a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia is constantly enduring, the country sadly remains poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though it was a warning of force.
It is at its best challenging to travel between Indonesia's numerous islands.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's dwindled infrastructure a core point of his election campaign, spending squandered money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is being harassed by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of slowing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought with knives, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons on the streets.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri signed for Sturridge when he was about 30 years away from the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He hit the ball to the left before kicking far to the goal pole.
The attempt sailed high over the frame as it hovered to the top right corner of the net.
Eventually, the ball tumbled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and in the net case.
"It was just trying to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and typed once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead by halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalkeeper played back to Mateo Kovacic in that area with a back kick before playing near midfield and innings in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and resigned in the midfield.
With a beautiful forward kick, he then led Hazard into the window.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended up in the farthest goal net with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool compete against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea will arrive at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europa League for Videoton on Thursday.
Death toll rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped under the rubbish of buildings that crashed the earthquake, which struck at a magnitude of 7.5 on Friday, and caused burns of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was polluted with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after wife was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on dashcam footage, to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman showed up at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing as police said they were in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed into or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take hours before they are allowed back in.
It has been heard that a police officer tells one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene.
She repeatedly said, "It's so awful."
At 2 a.m., there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block of apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to call <0x40>MerPolCC to DM, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of September 30 as a reference.
Parliament's Cromwell Statute Becomes Latest Memorial Hit with 'Rewrite of History' Dispute
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "satisfaction" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The imagery of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his forefather Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's manifold depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still believe to be commemorable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate depiction is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What stands out is that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Assassin Pork Tears Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his "Yuan," was found dead with a ripped artery covered in blood near a cage at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China on May 30, 2005.
He travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market on Wednesday.
The next morning, his nephew found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pighouse.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound pig bit the farmer to death.
"My nephew's legs were bloody and torn," said the nephew, named on his side of "Wu," quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed how Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his nephew.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police were gathering evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although weird, cases of pigs that people attack have reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig gripped a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife deterred the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster."
"They're not playing.
They're awkward, they're awkward, they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Rest of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flood rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.m., a Category 1 hurricane, from 5 a.m. on Sunday, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough across the Pacific begins to take shape and move east to the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to propel heavy tropical humidity northwards the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring rain of up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in response to the approaching trough, tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid floods, waste flows, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause spot-spot rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially across most of Arizona.
Hurricanes are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep rifts to hit wild rivers and thunderstorms will bring fierce local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall total figures of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth runways.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
Several scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains late Monday and Tuesday become more widespread.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole cools, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to start hot in October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Lower Plain to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks on Thursday after the poignant testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-snap turn: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh was beating her up drunk and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people looking at offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was always high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS on Friday morning where opponents screamed at him as he tried to take an elevator to a Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes as CNN vividly portrayed him becoming a puppet.
"I'm right here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and went before the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered live hours later when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI will look at the allegations against the candidate for next week, as the Democrat minority requested.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of 'political game' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticized her plans to leave the European Union, accusing it of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "utterly ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the quarrel.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS-affiliated WAFB reported.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish forensic office issued a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's escape task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police, and area citizens for their assistance with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked the area law application for its "zeal and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-footed forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 backs per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball captain Will Wade said the team was "flagged" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about," Wayde said.
Volcano spits like in Mexico City
As if spitting from the Popocatepeti volcano had reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater picked up and recorded 183 releases of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple drones and quakes.
Images on social media have shown how thin low-gas motor windscreens cover neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude central Mexico earthquake cracked in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo," has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists to commemorate independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined counter-protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for resignation.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by riot police, squandered them with eggs and tossed powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
A riot also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their clubs to control the fighting.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups on one tone sang "No Forgotten, No Forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionists' screams of "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the parades, the local press reported.
The tension is still high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum by Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent but the participation was low, with those against resignation largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent the ballot boxes from continuing in violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
"I saw my parents cry for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital but scary victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention for their role in organizing the referendum and following it.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was fuelled by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more stressful," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he will stand in European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car At Home Vasry
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed repeatedly against a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded Thursday at around 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
A crossbow may also have been shot at some point after the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston
Promoted Livigston surprised Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was proof of the difference when Gary Holt's team moved to second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team stayed that season in the Premiership without a win away and will face Heart next week, which is their eight-point lead.
The Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is extending their unconquered run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still not tasted a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston's chances of losing to bot visitors
Holt's team must have been ahead of them long before they scored a goal, with their bustling that brought Rangers all sorts of problems on the neck.
SR broke through, but drew in front of the goal cage, when AL could only play wide after coming closer and meeting CH's header across the goal cage.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with dead play moments.
That's when the decisive goal came.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson together giving Menga the chance to kick and score a goal from the middle of the frame.
By then, Rangers had dominated possession but could not penetrate the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely careless.
That pattern continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a reversal from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow went widespread to evade Livingston's yet-to-be-open game.
Crossovers repeatedly reached Livingston's frame and repeatedly blocked, while two penalties—after Halkett's challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball—were rejected.
‘Phenomenal’ by Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a phenomenal game for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still surpassed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and crew have been virtually unchanged since their return to first-class, but a lot of honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was giant with his manifold defensive ranks while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
The Rangers were short of inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they were able to penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smiling and blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a breakout on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan has opened a new mosque in Cologne.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – have also made their voices thick, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The fighting demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor who is greeted as a hero by some German Turks and outscored by others as an autocrat.
Deptford paddock crash: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision took place around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run staircase in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and alert his relatives.
Road closures and bus detours are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riots
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security man's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado guards" were called in to handle the riot, which included eight prisoners and was limited to one wing.
The guards were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind bars for longer."
HMP Long Martin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the chief jailer had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were summoned to pay attention to serious disorder during which staff with billiard balls were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kits Floods (Drought Areas Trek Possible Advantage)
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but it's exactly what could happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert, bringing risks of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday, and will be approaching with rain by Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Bowl, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside of rapid flooding risk, Rosa's rain will likely be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing a drought condition.
According to the U.S. Dryness Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to approaching land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is approaching cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore its power is decreasing.
It is expected that she will reach the country on Monday afternoon or evening at tropical storm strength in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Rainfall totals from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the Arizona border as a tropical depression on Tuesday in the early morning hours and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger expected from Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening rapid floods and debris streams in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area at around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he is still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who might have any cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered from the vileness, the anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and shocking tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered from the vileness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and vehemently and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her allegation.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans saw that day "the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to affirm one of the most capable legal spirits of our time, a jurist with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not standing, but I'm standing," he said.
That's why I'm running for this candidate."
Trump has argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with figures still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away when giant waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the town of Palu on the beach on Friday for a beach party when burners up to six meters (18 feet) high broke at sunset on the beach, washed many away after their death and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, said during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, stumps, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday night, the coastal town was swept away.
A series of earthquakes is felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant shaking was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant," saying thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Corpses of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the quake heart.
Communication "is completely obstructed with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting desperate warnings about the upcoming tsunami to the people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and smashes buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't immediately explain the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused major power outages that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuates still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for assistance efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises above 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City where employees were sheltered in rope shelters erected in their office's courtyard, they passed by on their way to scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even as relief groups begin the awful task of launching the disaster relief task, some people have complained that foreign relief workers with a lot of experience are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies and staff from overseas can only get started after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we can open it to international aid, but it doesn't yet have a status."
With the arrival of the second night on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been stuck under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachute squad, trained two of the missing parachute squadrons for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Another of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Monday, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute weaving field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon relates how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated on social media among the parachute hovering community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach party.
His messages, however, were answered only with one gray line mark, instead of two blue lines marks.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while refilling OTM at Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was emptying an ATM in an entertainment complex and getting ready to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West Will Change His Name to Ye
On Saturday, he tweeted, "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all-Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that cancelled for "emotional reasons," the program's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, this is us."
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
"The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also managed with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military power against civilians in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to restrain the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements throughout Latin America posted.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities attracted young people to gangs.
The U.S. must double its AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount it spends on research in that field, investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The remarks come after several sections of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even if briefly the U.S. has an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced their plan last year: they aim to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next major AI achievement being achieved in the U.S., Lee said in an interview to CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the hub of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-rated U.S. Othello player and later was a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired influential people from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the U.S.'s AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are distributing funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center aimed at involving partners from the industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an Election Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence last came under fire for months.
Macedonians vote in elections to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether their name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia," actions that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bots for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbor's name represents a claim in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum letter read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state's election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
But the turnout was then just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko are voting for the Macedonian referendum on the change of the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small raise and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said a "yes" outcome would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum — less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A setback in the referendum would be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian goalkeeper received a hint at the midfield at the start of the series.
He ran through between three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero is surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goal.
He then pushed a sign to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back for Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We're glad he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League competition.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that game, Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touchdowns before he led Sterling to the farthest goal.
The Sky Blues' forward kicked the ball into the net just before he was over the back line.
City takel Hoffenheim in Champions League Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the game, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to start the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play-out implications for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have made at least a promotional pick with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still want to tie their first division title.
"Although we don't play for anything, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level from any point I face this year.
Why don't I want to take part in it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly favourable to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throwing workout on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outs in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds meetings in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court elector Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big – I’m not standing, but I’m actually standing and that’s why I’m fighting for these candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, "One sees this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, one sees this happening now.
And they are now determined to take back power by using any possible way, one sees the meanness, the genius.
They don't care who hurts them, who they have to walk over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and power, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and ingenious and false."
He referred to the name to the Senate Judiciary Committee's high-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received harsh fines from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I’m waiting for one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a church.
It's intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I’m the last person in a string of Labour Party LPs who was told we’re not welcome – all because we’ve said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she boldly stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough, similar issues on which Jeremy differed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, that was exactly what Friday night's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "friendly, more benevolent" politics has long been forgotten, if ever begun.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there follows a tirade of scolding on social media that demands that I be not re-elected, disapproval of politics from the core and to tell me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I'm actually happier than my colleagues because the remarks directed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules, the party gets scared.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not be so outspoken and that I'll be "okay" then.
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party as a scholar 32 years ago, prompted by the Thatcher government’s neglect that literally abandoned my state high school, I’ve been trying to fight for better public services for those who need it the most – either as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country heading towards a Brexit that will harm all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voters, whether or not their members of the Labour Party are: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political advantage will keep me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have slightly skewed the final result, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to win in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the scoreline, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better odds, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be content.
"We've been tested in our matches so far and we're still unconquered, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor to Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, scored by Frazier Clima, made Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot scored an unintended three.
Clima increased Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before he scored a solo three just before resting to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, scored by Baggot, reduced the lag to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott carried on a portable, and from the start Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, scored by Clima.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure play.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for killing for Clima without the ball, and from the penalty line, MacPherson pushed the ball to death behind the upcoming Ayr maul.
Clima meant it, as he also did almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goal kick and sent flank Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth-three.
Still Game star looks like he's going to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star seems to be moving to the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is getting ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to get involved in Glasgow's "blooming restaurant industry."
'The sea is ours': Surrounded Bolivia hopes court will reopen away to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a masonry-covered naval quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea-blue flag.
Naval bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are marked with the slogan: "The sea is ours to the right.
It's a duty to get it back."
Across surrounding Bolivia, the memory of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – like the need to navigate the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IGH ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year – also has many that depend on Monday’s verdict.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that few will change if they do.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to allocate Chilean territory, and has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's verdict comes just six months after the final verdict, shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric hampered any remaining Chilean benevolence, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct subsequent talks.
The two countries exchanged last ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extraordinarily quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will "bring an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he said.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless its U.S. can trust
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to meet the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the competing countries' leaders.
His remarks follow US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream image" that continued sanctions and U.S. caption to a statement that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the statement without Pyongyang taking significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism as to whether Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country sees as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal Latest Series of Big Head Covers on the Way to the Shops Near You
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely dislike the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of lawfully oversized head coverings to their SS19 collection on the runway that captivated the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have swept through Instagram this summer and these designers have paraded their astonishing creations on the runway.
The highlight by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feather-like wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with jewels, a wizarding hat, and even an pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had finished lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like scuba gear, with a snorkel and goggles included, while another looked like a melted ice cream horn.
And if you continue the big fashion statement, it's your happy day.
Style viewers predict that the huge hats might be on their way to the stores near you.
The oversized hats briefly follow the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide rim seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread across social media sent another great creation across the runway – a straw-beach bag that was almost as big as the swimwear model that wore it.
The roasted orange raffia bag, finished with raffia embellishments and finished with a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in stores for next summer - as the designer has made such a huge impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills Essential for World Citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a slew of achievements of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, only enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community businesses.
With more than 30,000 schools across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see that world languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of scholars who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as a subject choice, have the same prestige as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Occupations and Skills found in 2014 that of the reasons employees provide why they struggle to fill jobs, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That's why it's so important now to invest in today's children's language education.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore they must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages should truly be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
I'm fine with the fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play, however, remains to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-season matches at this stage in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia meeting time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of elections tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies in the next week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently being held back for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming interim election because Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when it votes in November.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 a.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the live stream of Trump's gathering in West Virginia below.
Trump is likely to pay attention to this week's hearings for the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held back for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main point of view of this excess is to help the Republicans who are facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that these five gatherings in the next week were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and enlarge the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to mention his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's gathering, arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, will allow fans to draw from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, for the second time in the past month, Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to the voting patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, said in a statement.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have the courage to fight to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, the four-game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing of momentum is a totally invented sports concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"They went ahead with six points and now it's four, so we're wearing it as a bit of momentum, I reckon," Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and twelve more to be played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have so little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the top to the clean field and guided by his example.
That scoring celebration screams got harder as his lap progressed and he sank a critical set to win match four completely equal while he and Thomas were two laps behind after two laps.
Her set who won the game at 15 for them was greeted with a similar scream, the kind that tells one to believe that the American team still has a chance.
"You really just have to take it all out and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that these players are talking about.
18 holes to print their stamps.
The only players who have scored more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unpaired but charming couple got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't record one hold on track figures on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one hold on track figures on Saturday morning as well as during the back nine Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirms that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can sound a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously or at different puppies.
It's still too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short stint with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One hold on job figures and two doubles on the front nine left the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could hardly even get out.
On Sunday, there is no one to help you out.
The four-balls and four-game teams are so exciting to keep close track of due to the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and significantly took the lead on the last day, but this four-game session also showed that the U.S. team had the courage for the battle that some, especially at home, had doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four- and four-game games with a 10-6 lead.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that performed unevenly in the morning's four-balls, so they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the four games and won two games, but they didn't shrink the lag.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who is called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to score four points after their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellently together to defeat a pop Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and four-games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four balls, returned to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not always get its sense on a pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won a major tournament three times and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 3&4 in the four-games after losing the first two holes.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point backlog when entering the singles game, even though Furyk's team only needs to play equal to retain the trophy because they already hold it.
After being second best for two days, however, it doesn't seem like they're going to make a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will "decisively" disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions exacerbated its distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures of goodwill" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site, and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see a consistent response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will certainly not unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear weapons removal under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his words seemed meaningful in that it did not unconditionally reject unilateral removal of nuclear weapons as Pjongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump provided guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for tight international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. urges the 'destruction of nuclear weapons first' and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is a dream of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are aggravating our distrust."
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader drew attention at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings over the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: "If the party in this issue of nuclear destruction were South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
The tone of Ri's speech was nevertheless dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed at the U.S.'s landmass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump called Kim a "fire-fighter" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim abundantly for his courage for taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions must remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeframe for this, saying "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that "the application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue with diligence and without ceasing until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an effort to drain funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterwards said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there hasn't gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea accused him only hours later of making "gang-like demands."
North Korea, in a meeting with Moon, promised to demolish a missile site and also take a nuclear complex if the United States "consistent measures."
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wants to see are security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore as well as steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough russian
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all of its undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of studying by caffeine-driven "all-night sessions."
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often uninformed when it comes to the basics of how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her how important sleep is - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was presented for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how they improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to enter the course after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The hour-long course involves a few interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know what the health impact of choosing to smoke cigarettes is," Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in "studying all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's "secret weapon" should be to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid it to gain weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, making you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and being aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and lead you to struggle to get on the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal wins Gerrard's men
Rangers faced another sarge away day-to-day sadness when Dolly Menga's goalkeeper Steven Gerrard's disunited team scored a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only conceded Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager so his team was eight points behind Hearts, which went loose in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play equal without much inspiration.
While Rangers now fall to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further trouble ahead for Rangers after frontier judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown off the road.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in his nods with the way his well-trained team smothered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga's first defeat passed Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder opened his big chance.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs subsequently found captain Craig Halkett but his defense mate Alan Lithgow could only miss kicking at the rear goal pole.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have scored a penalty goal at the 15th point when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get just two shots to the target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's header shot and a strong goal from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it's just for their hard work.
The Rangers didn't deal with a deep set of Jacobs once again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained coolheaded and sent it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his streak to the block.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett grabbing ball long after long.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could get in far from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty kick when he messed up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Teller
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" calendar: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE ARE CONTINUING ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these earphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Well, that's about it!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' robbery cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill robbery cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them in a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A trial drug shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify robber cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers and called HER2, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat some kind of leukemia.
After his performance on SNL, Kanye West began a pro-Trump mockery speech while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was out in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an elongated performance in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, he ran out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to a white man so often and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, the footage of West's gossip was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock for West is trying to mock by posting it.
West also complained to the audience that it made it difficult for him behind the stage about what he was carrying on his head.
"I've been pushed to the back of the pitch.
They said, "Don't wear that hat."
They've bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would "put on his supercoat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked a show at the audience at least twice, and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there saying to the publication, "The whole studio has become dead-silent."
West was brought in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rhyme chatterer Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING TO THE CROWN."
Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts an ideology and proclaims that endangers my community.
He is free.
"We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhyme chatterer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Co-rum chatterer, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.

The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The indictment will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen mean that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt "reasonably strong" about working on this issue.
"I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have our men learned as they grow up regarding the problem we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that television is quite possibly responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what has been learned?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they need to have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think this really is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
"Something went wrong with our kids."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not participate in any of the Game of Thrones sequels and sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is "ready with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the premises of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, according to health officials.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, representing a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters protested on Saturday against allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that the allegations are driven by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and even disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's trial on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the postings was related to Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were endangered as a result of this fraudulent and false allegation - was not at all responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon provoked online criticism, including from former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seemingly being too angry during Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to lift Waters out of the pillows in the mid-election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he whispered.
In her statement, Waters said her office "notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally liable for everything they do that is destructible and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - faint Rowan Atkinson spy spottery
It's now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new British-style film and it seems applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy spottery franchise - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-choice self-satisfaction about the topic of how obvious power we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the awkward Johnny English with his out-of-the-box and rubber face has renewed his license to waste everything for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking movie audiences.
He is, of course, the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretense to sophisticated elegance, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a good shot from that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of riddles, leaving chaos behind him, who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two cool moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English walking up to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armored robe and cut the screw blades briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exhibited but the humor feels rather faint and oddly superfluous, especially when the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible are now using comedy itself with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's adversity isn't as original and focused as Atkinson's still movie jokes in the persona of Bean.
The perennial thematic assumption now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a deplorable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is an inflated and besieged character, who is already experiencing a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character, but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is at risk, she must summon someone from his retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some decent institution, but giving lessons from the record on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English hosts a School of Rock-type espionage school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, again portrayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allamapstic role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin of wasting everything completely in Her Majesty's secret service are back in service and they come across Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister ends up under the dangerous spell of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, who is portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury sailing yacht; and English lets pure anarchy unleash when he tries to use a virtual reality headpiece to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's home.
For that last scene, nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite a bit like children's TV.
fairly average.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't stop myself from thinking: Can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really puts his talent to the test?
Labour denies it's a plan for British to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has to consider a drastic plan that will cause Britons to work a four-day week - but be paid for five days.
The party allegedly wants company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to be passed on to workers by giving them an extra day.
It will allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend - but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say it will "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in the favor of the workers.
To change after a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day week of work is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the worker as well as with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, this ambition is currently not endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Workers' Conference to weigh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "winners" at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back as a Workers' Government can make "deductions" on the basis of alleged infringement.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private sector businesses to employees, who can receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could have them change their minds
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican Sense asked John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that could have them change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that accusation came out, and said, "Did you do this?
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice proved to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett vehemently denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars acting and having an equally impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Burger Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy not only performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a GDP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions," such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a great way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, World Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised.
The group estimates that the confirmed money so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential," and pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on its website that asks "what makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
"It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will be successful because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use fleet for "blockade" to reverse exports of Russian energy - Interior Minister
"If necessary," Washington could leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from landing in the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
And, according to an official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the oceans are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not land on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that sees itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that it is practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The rulings come as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoner."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s view sparked counter-reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" standing as president after the midterm elections.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman in the highest sport," she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider standing for president."
Warren aired her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town meeting, saying he "is taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should stand in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator shouldn't stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should potentially stand and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed to stand possible in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Calls Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's been going through since he came back, I sympathize with other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the injury our soldiers are returning with," she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. support challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge of a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court law assignment in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy in August has not been made public.
She says her partner "and his violent gang-member boys" abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014 that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores dozens of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications will be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates that policy," the friend-of-the-court court order said.
Lawyers further argued in the legal mandate that the policies that refuse immigrants entry are damaging the U.S. economy and say they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed labour."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly nebulous.
"It feels very tense," 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said as she comforted her feverish baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen returning to their devastated homes, searching through inundated possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's military hospital where patients are being treated outside due to continuous severe aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the rubble of the walls, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador for China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid entry in the Des Moines Register -- the state's Iowa newspaper with the most sales -- after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, a complaint China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war that has led them to level tariff rounds on each other's imports.
China's retaliation rates early in the trade war were aimed at beating exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now exacerbating the bullying by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government is seizing America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, one will find very limited dissenting voices at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing and not see any real reflection of the diverse opinions the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers shunned the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women's voters for interim elections with Kavanaugh debacle, warn analysts
While many top Republicans stand by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh defending him in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see counter-reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming interim elections.
Emotions about this are running tremendously high, and most Republicans are on record already indicating that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s call for an FBI investigation would be enough to appease harsh voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday - they're not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is on its way!" as they protested in the Senate entrance hall as Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony outlining the details of her allegation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continue to confirm.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said in a statement last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh will be put on trial, it's also about how Republicans handled it and how they treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
But Americans seem slightly divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with slightly more on the latter's side.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents decide whether or not they are likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they do or are likely to believe for Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh had probably or definitely joked during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's impeachment, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her at the age of 17 while drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, launches a startup business that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do this now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional utilities.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it depends entirely on the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
As of this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the utilities available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce an overall change, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the Worldwide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the Worldwide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victorian Cross Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had earned the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed him to the line of fire and with the "greatest bravery" led the line forward before assaulting a man-only field rifle and knocking out three of the division.
Lt. Kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never do, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a cliff to the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he was "honoured to be able to play a part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a bunch of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night watching Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just to not be able to watch the main event.
The San Jose program featured 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be broadcast live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to announce the fight, viewers in the UK were stunned when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "something sick joke."
"It's government regulations that the content at 6 a.m. was not appropriate and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," ja."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will be working on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about the retransmission, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But our work on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of texts being sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally do – and we tried to offer more to our fans and just went over our time.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't gone to high school before realizing that "not everyone is like me."
When speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had lied his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning at the Olympics.
The regular host of the year-long program, Kirsty Young, dropped off for a few months due to illness.
When he appeared as a cast on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than anyone else when he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings are of feeling less than, and differently feeling, the real things that have given me the strength and energy to achieve success."
He wanted to prove he was "something," he said, so he would not disappoint anyone when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has evoked his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man -- U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "catched him aside."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” – he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medalist is Robbie.
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him, 'You're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of my home crowd at an Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which also resonated with him in building up to the Olympics and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson won't be able to pull out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get his form straight to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12th time in the biannual event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and fours.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will split his day between being a ration leader and working on his game on the practice floor in hopes of fixing what matters.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the most straightforward driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long quarrel always punishes the wandering blows.
And as if the track isn't challenging enough on its own, Mickelson will face accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth game on Sunday, teaming up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles games well, Mickelson's game can be absolutely essential.
Fury expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a knock on the back and put his arm around me and said he'd be right tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Heroes' Hall and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I've put more in perspective, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the player who played the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the highlights of his individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence contributed intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's taken, he likes to shave the crazy, and he's a wonderful guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him, which was fun to see.
It's so much more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead before the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won nail scratch with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nail scraping," Bjorn said, in the photo, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 and yesterday 10-6 ahead at Le Golf.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going to be full tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you've got the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players that are in our team, but we're also well aware of who is on the other side - the best players in the world."
Delighted with how his players have performed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never anticipate things with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow, it's the individual participation that comes in the turn, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there individually, you're being tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to pass on to players, get the most out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his peer Jim Furyk will want his players to perform better individually than they did as gamemates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself had been transformed on both sides of that big last-day, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in reply when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players on their way to that last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as was seen at Brookline, as was seen at Medinah.
When that momentum starts going in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle games.
We set up our team accordingly and divided up the men that we felt, you know, would bring something magical to us tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and faced Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the classification.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it to the end," Bjorn said about his singles choices.
Germany's new warship postponed
The German military's latest frigate would have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
This vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the distressing post-delivery issues plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle order of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home bats.
But continuous delays mean that the advanced warships – which will apparently enable Germany to project power overseas – will already become obsolete by the time they enter service.
The disastrous F125 frigate made up last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media has mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been revealed that the ship is drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – has also become an issue.
It apparently reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems that have bitten the new frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that the strength of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy's "ships that can be deployed are running out."
The official said the issue has worsened over time, as old ships have been put out of service, but no replacement vessels have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Bats' Secret Life
New research is being conducted on a estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano dwarf bats as well as the brown longhorn and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand indicators.
Expert clan channels of all surveys will check the frequency of bat calls and determine which species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale view of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as pasture creation and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping place and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to show off bugs and obstacles on their flight greetings.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly do surveys and sleepover inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager David Thompson said the estate was the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there's so much about bats that's still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stresses the need to search for bats before maintenance is done in properties because it is possible that the unknowing destruction of a single birthplace could mean the death of up to 400 females and young ones and could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or prevent them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations as prosecutors prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German news magazine, Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added.
Ronaldo's attorney is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they called, according to Reuters, "unadmissible reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount equal to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was "99 percent" a "good guy" abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and this summer, in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal, moved to Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will "repent forever" if their car manufacturers lose
The UK will "regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will have to temporarily cease production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit could cost posts.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory cease," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just on time" basis, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be disruption at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be discontinued.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications from not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that in the long run, additional costs could reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union's caller on the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed by another week" as the fight over nominees for the Supreme Court continues, White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia, and possible interference of law by the president.
Whether or not Trump will resign the Deputy Attorney General, threatening Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip stories for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a recorder to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate court hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for it has not yet been set, it could be this week, I can see that it is being postponed by another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists will differ with that statement: Sanders hasn't held a White House personal information session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a reluctance for TV journalists to be "effectively hunted," although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they are."
She said direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, then it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying a lot to do this and you've seen us do it a lot over the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press briefing session when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press releases with visiting dignity officials.
Solo press releases are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of journalists who were there.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish they would stay after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to cover the costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, heading towards expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also tightened its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value each staff member's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line-up player Christion Abercrombie had emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before resting.
"He came to the sideline and kind of just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before being placed on a portable and taken backwards for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is out of theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/extent of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving off Illinois.
He killed five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total to 18 deadlines for the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's effort to attract young voters.
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's effort to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government's plans to work against homelessness.
The additional tax – which is beyond the current seal tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent – can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens, which pushes up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many affluent areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by looting land, but not using it, and urged Ms. May to renounce quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain's "housing disaster."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rent control and an end to "no-fault suspensions."
He also wants to give the council greater powers to build new homes.
Ms May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it may not be right that it is just as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as it is for overseas based companies to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness has become an overly large reality."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to run Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East team, currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got the second team, but it was all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But as a child, I often watched Scotland at Hampden with my father and that's something that pulls me back.
"It can only happen if I'm successful with the team."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss said he feels no fear of imitating such established names at such a large club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured by ''Can I have this club return to the Premier League?''
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club out there again."
Ross's career in management is just three years away, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and converted St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to champions of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he's now feeling more comfortable than he's ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he says when he recalls how he took over Alloa's reins.
"I really believed that driving was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I've done well enough, made a reasonable existence of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things a person has to do weekly.
I'm still going through this in terms of the stress and pressure of work, but driving feels just right.
I've always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it, it feels like the most comfortable I've ever been in my own skin during my entire adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain's struggling bars' income, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July – but revenues in restaurants were down by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as last month, June, when drinking spots were up by 2.8 percent, besides restaurants being hit even more heavily.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-led drinking spots and bars fared better and rose more than restaurants dropped.
Food-led drinking spots also suffered in the sun, but not as badly as restaurant operators
It seemed like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across managed bars and drinking spots, sales rose by 6.6 percent for the month, with food wash down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of Recreation and Hospitality Analysts RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a fall in sales of 4.8 percent year on year would be particularly difficult beyond continuous expense pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring necessary relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake Insta pages"
The news has increased fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of learners say they have a "main account" to show to parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has increased fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of learners said they had a clean "main account" to show to parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teen who urged others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them down."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voting for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her far-reaching experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes myself and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games among his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC connoisseur, unable to walk after having a brief ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but fully recovered, re-learned how to walk and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers to cows divides opinions online
A breast pump company shared opinions online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows milked.
To celebrate the launch of what's called the "world's first silently portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-mouth music video-inspired advertisement to showcase the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who are milking out.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straw and cows to the tune of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you didn't see, it's not udders, it's my breasts."
The choir section reads, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the ad published on the firm's Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it underscored the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.
The Elvie breast pump discreetly fits into a food bra (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else remarked: "Understandably traumatic for mom and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "The advertisement is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "screaming funny" for her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I had still been breastfeeding.
Milk made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
"It's a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another remarked: "This is a fun ad directed at mothers who are milking out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is dead-silent, has no threads or tubes, and discreetly fits into a feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are milking out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a big and enticing launch.
By drawing a parallel between women de-milking and dairy cows, we wanted to put the de-milking process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring in in an entertaining way where people can connect.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has caught the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to fierce rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be endangered by moving forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested thousands of people who applied to sponsor unaccounted-for minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That's why we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconferencing call, rather than in person, to advocate their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unfit for emergency relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more easily overlooked due to the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria says U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil, on the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be "handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more being uprooted, is "almost over."
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this holy struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, training and advising mostly Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions are in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They're politicizing something that should just be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no rebuilding aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel settlement created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has repelled a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists, including warriors from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who will be "exterminated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals end his presidency early.
In what is undoubtedly "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To this day, there are no signs of eye-catching fatigue.
Since 2014, peak time viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is at the top of cable viewing numbers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news outlets.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congressional building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" he told me. Scovell told me.
There's a lot of fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Eliminating is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of it to watch a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich fly jacket ("a garment thick of the hubris), Trump said in a statement.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he's doing you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role distribution and daily twists in the plot (such as looking for a quarrel with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode or you'll be left behind.
When I reached for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't tear himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Judiciary and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scales.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs at the time and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

External money flows to the most exciting mid-term election race in the House
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing an influx of money, thanks to a shift of congressional districts that has now landed two officials in a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district allows Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – to measure forces.
Lamb faces another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, heavily overlapping with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th started with a campaign funding competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nail scrape win in a widely viewed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China, but then retreated
Diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," the department's spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials had made it clear that they wanted Congress to continue to effectively end any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the severity of the meeting for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberation on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Studying History
The next thing that could happen could be the special deliberation on Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible interference with the court, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also believed to be focusing his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia cooperated in the country's attack on our elections.
If Congress were to pass into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face accountability in that body just as he prepares to go before the voters again, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
It’s a lot of axes, and with that I don’t want to imply that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his peers in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be extended.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy's relentless course is speeded up or slowed down.
Americans now face multiple such turning points in the face.
What would we do if Mr. Trump Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, dismissed?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to take the president in secret and speculated about whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim election for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we follow those tests, there is a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I don't think we will fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that lived in my ambassador's house at one time.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath cherries on that table carrying the swastika.
With that in mind, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic for Rapid Vienna match
Rangers play hosts for Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance from the season to the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a jumping-off for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it at the end, but a tie count is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is a big European day.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they've had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a good feeling factor to the place.
It's a good thing, and the men are enjoying it, and the coaching is good.
Hopefully we'll be able to push through now, sit behind us last season and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this retirement savings fear
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family for care if you don't express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut legal disputes down at the pass.
Get a health care representative in place so that you can appoint a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
You'll also need to pay attention to your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unfit.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What's the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot in Ilfracombe with windshields
A man was shot several times with a windshield when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications put out of action, relief officers were unable to obtain any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-range earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were taken to safety after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regentship, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, causing nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific’s Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake along the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that resulted in a tsunami that hit 14 countries resulted in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds have died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 range hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, resulting in a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, resulting in a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of towns and resulted in about 300 deaths.
2016: A plane quake hit the Pidie Jaya county in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly quake and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed because of buildings that crashed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence, and resisting arrest, according to a report released by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up a female acquaintance's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Preliminary Trial Facility and is being detained on a $500 uninsured bail, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring "innocent, definitely" when asked what he was pleading for, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A violations, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time a criminal complaint has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while drunk, in connection with the incident.
His wife said he had her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after linking her son's behavior to PTSD as a result of his duty in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake resulted in a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspect in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that caused the deaths of eight people - a rare punishment not yet executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan to mow off pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to request the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder in favor of extortion, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "meticulous planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov conducted it as "detestable, cruel and perverted."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of a plot to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro-Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a life imprisonment acknowledgment with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team previously called on prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backseat man Peter Bone said for the Birmingham march that the UK "would be out" by the time Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Ms. May to unite her deeply divided officers has been highlighted by pro-Roman Tories joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies urged her to push the door in her attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the dead end – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and ‘chaos’.
Mr. Bone said for the Loop Meaning Loop meeting in Solihull that he wanted to "throw out Chequers."
He suggested that Mr Farage be made a nobleman and be given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we'd be out by then," he said.
The Wellingborough LP added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must throw out Chequers."
He explained his opposition to the EU, saying: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own bets in our own country."
Mr Bone has rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘I am simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure we are elected in the first place.
"Leave Chequers, please, and start listening."
In a direct message to Ms. May, she added: “First ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farge said the convention politicians had to "feel the heat" if they were on the verge of wanting to violate the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you get away with it.'”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a convention for two hours in the city center.
A few activists waved Tories against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour nobleman Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application as the conference opened.
"It's the people who tell us they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s an overall smart thing.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to "look hard" to stand for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "look hard to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the middle of speculation that she might be challenging Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump took office.
A resident asked her if she was planning to stand for president.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the very top."
Arrested in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 lead last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebound balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
This became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the races.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the very back of the bundle, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes drilled a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced to wheel-to-wheel action that left the Ferrari driver reluctantly risk-free to see the inside at risk of endurance after a double move to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the jumping grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the races as he held on to his bands to finish quickly and crossed Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the pits on the 44th lap, but could not speed up his pass in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job of having a one-two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad lift.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a convention in West Virginia, the president did not address directly the testimony that Ford gave before the Senate Law Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has entered the Senate in the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do this."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you get it?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a bit.
"No, we didn't, we didn't," he said in a statement.
Feinstein was sent the letter outlining the allegations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak had come down from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not take her denial well and commented during Saturday night’s convention: “I tell you what. It was quite bad body language.
She may not have, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back by any necessary means.
You see the meanness, the rudeness, they don't care who hurts them, who they have to surround to get power and control," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have reconciled for Friday's Elite League's loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead by pitchers from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals tied their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost matches and then won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's open ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until in the first break in when he threw his second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again tied them with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure to win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on airplane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that badly swayed at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained immobile to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on runway at the time, was able to safely take off.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait says the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're heartbroken to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is still rising as many bodies are still under the falls while many cannot be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached up to six meters ripped Palu who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-market is being plundered orally."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I always ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after shore lake plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia said one man was missing after they said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they are working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had come in very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through mid-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said ships working close to improving a wharf also helped an inflatable boat rescue people back and forth before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in collapses of PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analysts set a timeline of the evening when a woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's draw that night, Sanford said he was "joking because my draw was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers wiped messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is there a black person?!
New York's maid sues couple because she was fired after "racist" text
A New York babysitter sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrectly addressed message from the mother who complained that she was "another black person."
The couple denies being racist and compares the case to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her dismay when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NOW A BLACK PERSON," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to me twice.
After finding out her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice, saying that their African-American nanny was doing bad work and that she was rather expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks his damages up to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, resident job for which she was initially appointed, even though it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing that kind of good," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple resorted to the allegations that they were racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice's employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," Man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even if it were by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now."
Plasco compared the case to "extortion," saying his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you just going to kill a person?"
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the case was still going on, the court of public opinion had been quick to bring the couple on social media and hijack them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared a talking bear would not connect readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
"It's very exciting that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been fiery if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release after his death last year was "bittersweet."
About Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-haired man," she said.
But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he saw Paddington's success sort of that way.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say hello to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heart paralyzed.
I will soon be with you.
I will be with you.
The medicine the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly fading up and leaving her system.
She was dead a while before that, and the body was shutting down.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that this would unfold.
I couldn't whine or scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it up."
Eventually, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, who was hurt by the time for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the trial appreciated she had gone.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had my head down and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad on the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving Women Post Cards to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want a parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
"They always said that her smile clarified any departure."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the very lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them."
She said her death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It's ripping a hole through the family.
This is breaking us apart.
We all have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still undecided as FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something as he asked for -- a timeless investigation that had no cover -- we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" under entrenched partisan congestion.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have the FBI to investigate?
It's all about timing.
The interim elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans are going badly, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to elect to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who through him met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI released the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get up to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's survivor numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean warriors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug quoted data from the South's unification cabinet and said there were 1,127 overlaps last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of warriors from the North are eventually offered South Korean civil rights.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protective demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China regards the warriors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war with each other - have improved strikingly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the strike negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historically," says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "historically" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted like this, they would say 'history'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at the time almost screamed and choked while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly disapproved of Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "ridiculous and coordinated character assassination," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's making himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I will say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court where he is at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ommegang Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he is considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would circumvent certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of anger boiling over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also said that she was crying when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just started.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for restraint because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being grabbed by my neck skin by an older woman - a cold manager I was a little scared of - who dragged me into a t-report area.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they've had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find collections and so she made a vow that she would not enter the races unless she raised $2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that of her fans who gave $1,000 to men, only $250 would give her.
"Do you think I'm going to cut it off?" she wondered.
When she delivered her speech, announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful to the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and angry at sexism - that she succumbed.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salute of the trade war between the US and China has been deafening and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most interesting escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 trillion) items and effectively taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated in goods each time, recently hitting tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 trillion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to equate the US shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
Getting Washington to stand back means surrendering to requests, but publicly complying with U.S. requests would be too much of an embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure on U.S. trade war over long-term China could positively support by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that an economic midnight flight could start in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focused on Asia at the center of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation at ground level is more stable and secure due to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people who still live in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flat land.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, blew her T-hold in the water at the par-3 16th hole and conceded his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his rounds and became one of the 1-on-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest ranking player, Dustin Johnson, has fallen 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
I'm so thankful for Thomas and his faith in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's all about the team and I'm glad I could help," an emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the torch over to his compatriot John Ram, who won US golf champion Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
The incredible pride I feel in defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old man," said Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S. struggled all weekend to find the clean field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke on behalf of his team after a disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a time this morning when we put a little heat on Europe.
We've scrapped it.
