The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know either Voldemort or the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city council at all.
The newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has once "knocked off" members of the new council from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, as they dominate the notorious slang that has become popular in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the late era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils in terms of which these new terms fall somewhat in the dark.
At least that's what they say.
“Who is Voldemort?”
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "paten vocabulary".
But Councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina - a political veteran - also reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "golf hole".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use from time to time."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of slang."
From the vocabulary published by the daily newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June of this year before the ODS Election Congress, the editorial board selected six terms, especially those notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "largest Prague golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "star neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague's school system - promised his participation in the conversation at first, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and I don't judge how the bourgeois Democrats talk to each other."
"For me, it's important how we understand each other within the framework of our programs," he countered.
As already indicated, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not recognize in the headline mentioned above that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek, is speaking.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed at the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, but added to the security: "But I rather know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I'll probably have to take a language course."
The "golf hole" is then correctly deciphered as a blank tunnel not only by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
But both S&Ds also know who Voldemort stands for and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even suspects where this figure can be found and therefore also what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague restaurant," Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is quite close to the solution of the mystery, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
In agreement with B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, however, he asserts that he had drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be a similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
“I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there’s really no such thing with us.”
"We call each other by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> - called "Hulda" by his partymates.
"In school I was called B<0xC5><0x99>íza (birch), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Denik Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party peers of the "Grandpa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who before the elections brought himself to the attention by machinations in the party sponsorship, is called "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" (known Czech Lego figure) by some colleagues.
Thus, nicknames are the only nicknames that the Social Democrats allow in the inner-party language.
Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly does not like being called "Hulda", but Denik Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Button Rights" is allegedly related to the fact that Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> acquired his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and published a brochure
Women who are stamped as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they do not find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women "becomes a witch", she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
“Even young and healthy women are spared this, as they help at work and give birth to children,” a religious sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home caring for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he published a brochure to stop the "witch-hunt".
But the thing has a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out the dilemma of written enlightenment.
Being accused of witchcraft is commonplace in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured it over with petroleum and just set it on fire.
Among other things, the BBC server reported on this incident.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the case was merely a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil was inflamed, which was used for ritual anointings.
And that’s after the group tried to “expel an evil spirit” from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" support the people here without regard to their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Founders of human souls are a danger in the past as they are today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least striving to defuse the witch hunt, last year the President of Gambia himself was meticulously involved.
"President Yahya Jammeh initiated a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
“He called on shamans from nearby Guinea to help those who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president’s bodyguard, had indiscriminately kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the imprisoned people were forced to drink a waste of plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that the nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He does heat in the oven but still pays higher rent
An elderly underage man is just leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm a briefcase with three new leases for three apartments: for his own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just increased their rent as part of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of a monthly rent of 3,500 kroner, the son is expected to pay 4100 kroner for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category next year.
"And there is not even flowing warm water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal furnace," he taps with his finger on the new lease of the son, to which he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half disagreed and half resigned.
Citizens’ association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new lease terms as “incorrect and immoral,” advises tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7 to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man is just waving off.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region is thus becoming a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants so far do not pay a marketable rent.
Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and as early as nine o’clock in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and at her a call-up device.
"Rent 2011", a special touch panel lights up on the touch screen.
Shortly taped and the device spits out a number sheet.
We barely deciphered the number "157" and it already beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
Starting in mid-November, the envelopes in the Ostrava region will flow into the mailboxes with the new lease agreements for most tenants of the total of 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
In the letters, the RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for the new rentals in the client centre has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, this is only the beginning," the ladies behind the counter reply after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala’s former miners’ homes are an urgent issue.
Prior to the elections, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD parliamentary vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek from Ostrava had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
“Twenty years I want a new floor from them.”
"They couldn't even replace toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning says to himself.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly waiting at the counter to see if they really get the promised rental discount that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The benefit of a half-reduced February rent should also come to the other tenants, who sign the new lease until 15 December.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov is anything but overburdened by demands.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 was due here," the counter officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites, as well as wall panels, where it seems necessary.
However, if the parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
“This is not to be a threat, but to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure,” RPG said in a statement.
"Nobody goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially agrees with her.
"I have 13,000 (kronen) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I take the money for a court case," he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic by New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - in particular, the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the angry tenants is, in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion from the rents received in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting room of Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov, a few red glowing information appear in the meantime.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31,200 apartments, which means more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month," can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 homes from RPG’s portfolio will increase rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it's about increasing extremely low rental prices from 19.66 CZK per square meter," RPG argues.
With 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive rents upwards, but gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But, above all, these should benefit those who sign the lease increase agreements.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that comes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architectural firm Arch.Design, from whose studios come a whole series of well-known Brno buildings, counted on the premises for its company mini-undergarden from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building.
In a wiser sense, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are at the baby boom age and the company is keen that the project managers return to their workplaces as soon as possible.
Along with the possibility to work shorter, kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
The civil engineers and architects have thus made it easier to bring their demanding profession and childcare under one hat.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is funded by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic’s state budget.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies of CZK 2.8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment were procured and for the duration of 2 years, qualified personnel and operations were taken care of.
After the funding has been exhausted (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue running the mini-kindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing effective assistance in the processing of applications.
Full-time qualified staff takes care of the children - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can attend children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, however, the day alternates over several children.
The kindergarten operation is adapted flexibly to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is about individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the supporting program of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool lessons, by the way, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and so the stress of late picking up the children from a far away kindergarten is eliminated.
Parents use their time more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also developing here.
Arch.Design thus ranks among the Czech companies that offer clear benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are torn fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic shapes was nicknamed "Knochenhaus".
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles and mosaics, the dandruff-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living creatures.
It is only on closer inspection that one notices that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the entire façade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination enhances the shine of the colors.
The same swinging lines and entangled shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even glance holes and grooves.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43 was created by the renovation of a house from 1877, executed by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to Gaudí’s idea for an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, the Casa Batlló building was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It is precisely on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner were created, and the use of mosaics on the facade was also his idea.
However, many other designers and artists also worked on the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí’s Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the local inhabitants gave the house its organic shapes due to the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "gaining house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system unique to the time with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
Something bizarre already seems to her 45-degree inclination.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes of the time and was by no means deceived by them.
Before the construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so horrified at the result when it was completed that they demanded remedy.
Among other things, the councillors also objected to the fact that the building with its pillars even interfered with the public sidewalk.
However, there were no changes, quite the opposite - only fifteen days after the request of the district in this regard, Josep Batlló made an application for approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor was a social lounge, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey building passes through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the interconnection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house received a rather unusual roof and two more floors due to Gaudí’s renovation, in addition to a new facade.
Also impressive is Gaudí’s play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard is clad and the lighthouses.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house the highest degree of light.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors, which absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can now be visited by anyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When they found out that this was a fairly profitable business, they kept the sights, even expanded them to other common rooms and the attic, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get a 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, you should try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and bed frame? Women have different desires than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the reclining area - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
When choosing, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house that is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be reversed regularly.
If they do not have enough venting ducts in the core and lie on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not excluded that mold forms underneath them.
Of course, what you are used to is also important when it comes to choosing.
If you have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, it will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Well, all the hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can no longer sleep properly here."
"For their shredded shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (memory foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I also recommend these to people with diabetes, who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can poorly receive the "information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That’s why I bought these visco foam (memory foam) mattresses for many hockey players and other customers years ago.
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico, among others."
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it really sticks to the warm body.
Nowhere is it pressing, at night you do not roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wound burn).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles to the height of the body, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women, who are about 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm wide, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate.
For convenience and for potential visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterers and room furnishers, who for years devoted herself to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise, there is nothing else left but to mount the grid at different heights and this is far from possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with a feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be for the mold layer and the fine cushion.
“You shouldn’t feel the feathers with your hand or when you sit down,” warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and mattress as well as siamese twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can not be ventilated and the cover can not be washed, which is already commonplace today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 litres of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) sieve.
That is also why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifespan of up to 25 years for mattresses, even a lifetime warranty.
Every thing has its if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, yet it is advisable to use a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattress covers are usually made with a round zipper, so that you get two halves after opening (very important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially carried out alone, often seems like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a grate?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are none already in it) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine cushion.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (if necessary also combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable slatted frames with 14 to 18 spring strips (slats), always with a larger number of slats, i.e. 28 and more spring strips, with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebrae region and the possibility to regulate the slat hardness.
Adjustable slatted frames do not include mattresses with spring skeletons, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring strips, which makes it possible to press the spring strips or even to angle them in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink point-by-point.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - you treat them to these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or grids with point elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are designed.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and proper rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears, as the Scandinavians, for example, like.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Also with mattresses, the new magic word is "bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, the production of polyurethane foams is increasingly using natural oils - for example castor and soya oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called mattresses that have a core of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh wood or lavender fragrance while sleeping.
Here, too, you make a difference between man and woman.
While in men, a "cooling" plant extract of birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have a "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
However, for a high-quality mattress you have to pay 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to gain this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
Occasionally, there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with covered visco-foam memory for CZK 11,990.
The second one comes for free.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur softens when warm, and in a cool environment it solidifies.
Thus, it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are not only used in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as, for example, in special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the Eucatherm C foams, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and More Parents Want Human Monitoring Devices to Keep Kids Under Control
The fear of their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them by GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, is just as good at locating people, which would be helpful even in such cases, as recently when the nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková disappeared without a trace.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it should not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka in fear and horror and so they are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of compromising their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases there may be abuse of such devices, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without him knowing it, but we haven't seen such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for safety reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally when they don’t want to be controlled.”
"Even the mobile phones initially aroused great expectations among parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility will actually help in the event of an attack.
"In planned kidnappings, the kidnapper virtually always checks if the child has any electronics with him that could be used to locate it."
“Today it’s the cell phone.”
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sales would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted to report the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even an inclination meter is integrated, which means that if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to use a special software.
The problem with current locating devices is that they are either matchbox-sized devices that resemble trailers or smaller phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin of Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are therefore being tested in the present day.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Or he only realizes that after a certain amount of time, which gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development is going – towards bracelets or pendants, the same technology is always used as in vehicle tracking.
So to the combination of tracking function using the GPS system (just like the GPS in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap the whole of the Czech Republic but keep them for only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition cords, to be detonated with explosive devices.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already supplied 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the public company STV Group, a.s. for lippy 40 million crowns.
In his justification for purchasing this huge amount of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of ignition cord annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, it is clear from this statement that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretary and cleaning ladies.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be half-justified.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still holds that for the training of every new professional soldier two meters of ignition cord is completely sufficient, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased need of the pioneer and special forces.
Soldiers of the rapid-action brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so shooting exercises are severely restricted due to the lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
"I also don't understand why they buy such a lot of ignition cords from us."
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a dealer want to meet as much as possible," says STV Group sales manager Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of firing line by saying that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of the STV Group, however, only speaks of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, but who wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of its service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not in vain, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition line.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek tells us the view of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defense.
For comparison, the annual consumption of ignition cords by police pyrotechnicians who liquidate ammunition from World War II or the Soviet brother army has barely exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only such amounts of this ammunition that they can still consume before the end of its service life.
Already for the safety of the pyrotechnicians, in addition, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus reliable ignition cords remains open.
The Ministry of Defence already has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovak People’s Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics, which addressed MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in a few years with the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords, which they have bought so "inexpensively" today.
To this day, I have the contacts I have won thanks to the competition.
The winning position in the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
Winner of the last vintage of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition was Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there is a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he acquired a destructive house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a college student in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He leased the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit into the house, which he then converted step by step to a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all accommodation categories in just seven years of business activity in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
Another first-class hotel was added this year.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun franchise have already signed up," says the number one entrepreneur from last year.
"A large share of this license sale to operate hotels just had the victory in the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition," Mr. Pytloun adds appreciatively.
The victory has earned him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, often congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did really well,” he recalls.
I really recommend anyone who wants to create something to take part in this competition.
You don’t have to win right away, any visibility is good.
He says that he continues to benefit from contacts and acquaintances that would otherwise not have happened at all.
"With some people I met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships to this day."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success also reflects a little on each of his employees.
And there he is to the seventy.
“I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that is universally recognized.”
I really don't see this as just a personal success, no, it's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name has only been slightly put into the foreground," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory-seuphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its determination, Farmet has the worst behind it.
The prize for the first place of the Vodafone company competition of the year last year was received by Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, the company owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury commended the efforts he made in the small tool building in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice, a company that generates hundreds of millions of revenues.
"I can say that this appreciation encouraged not only myself, but also all of my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s history, there was an effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD> a small workshop to rent as compensation for the property seized by the communists, he did not hesitate, letting his career in the company in which he was employed until then, and founded his own company for the manufacture of plastic tubs with a few of his father’s comrades.
Shortly afterwards, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have risen to become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through the success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it also entered the awareness of the non-professional public.
"Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country to attach greater value," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year at Farmet, however, was not only marked by victory euphoria.
The appreciation was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of toolmaking products.
The crisis, which at the time was shaking citizens, but above all businesses, was just reaching its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course we could not escape this situation."
“Revenues decreased by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to redundancies,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black, even with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to make cuts - in terms of investment in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training center, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in winning - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD> says.
A poll that clears up nonsensical rules
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsense regulations have already succeeded in eliminating the world.
The dubious winner of the next year's "Absurdity of the Year" poll advanced the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
Thus, more than a third of not all four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register in the future when checking social security payers," <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová said.
The purpose of the "Absurdity of the Year" poll is to examine all the regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to repeal the nonsensical ones.
This is the fourth time this year that it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the Tsch. Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and enjoys growing popularity among the public.
If last year there were three thousand voters, this year there were already four thousand.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to hinder corporate activity.
"For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we are at the forefront of the world," says Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurship has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, a ranking eight times worse than the previous year.
The Absurdity of the Year Competition was launched for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of September.
The web address for registration is www.firmaroku.cz. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and lets the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 senseless regulations and orders have already been registered for this year’s opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay for highways and highways tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must set up every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square is part of an event in which political and public figures regularly take part.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were part of the competition at the peak of the competition.
“Wherever the state throws clubs between the legs of entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my goal is to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year that are still unnecessarily making their business difficult for entrepreneurs today,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
Efforts to eliminate nonsensical arrangements are effective.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to report to the trade office at the site of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to go to an exhibition stand or a circus.
This obligation was abolished by virtue of a novelty of the Trade Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Labour Office missions of employees in the scope of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
As an absurdity of 2009, the decree imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the conference room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation dropped.
A new category honours socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair undertakings.
“We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” said Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafon, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the Rebel of the Year competition.
This year's first year of this special sub-category of the main competition Vodafon company of the year registered companies, for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and offers enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject matter of their activity, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, people with disabilities are involved, as are personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the formation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in a variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory in Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady also takes good care of its health-disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title of "Responsible Company of the Region of Central Bohemia"; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it took third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which, among other things, introduced a fluid and also reduced to an average of 35 hours per week working time and this without a proportionate reduction in wages.
At the award ceremony, the jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our entrepreneurial activities and administration on the environment," explains its Managing Director Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem region, in turn, cares about the health of its employees, which is why it has purchased ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, and also encourages homework for its employees and uses carting services offered by a domestic protected workshop for corporate actions.
"In addition, we support the "People in Need" Foundation, which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>ní" from the Karlovy Vary region is worth mentioning, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions for food, work, training and holidays," says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D> of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
For the category Responsible Company of the Year, all district finalists of the Vodafon Company of the Year competition were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed in the application and sent it to the organizer no later than August 15.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the "Responsible Company of the Year" competition, but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year, they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration for this competition alone is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," said Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in a public tender
In the building of the land fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was taken away by the detectives in handcuffs.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate a public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the plots offered in the competition fell to a specific interested party.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. is said to have paid half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the offense of fraudulent machinations in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsen prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo", she could not grant further details with regard to the ongoing investigation.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old was released by the police.
How he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated in the light of the scarce official information.
Lubomír <0xC4><0x8C>erná, spokeswoman for the Land Fund, pointed out to Právo’s question in this regard that the police had actually made arrests at the Pilsen subsidiary of the Land Fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she said.
According to Ms <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public competition had the correct designation "Call for tendering claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants indicate interest in the offered land.
"These persons offer, in the context of the call, a higher value of their claims for restitution to be settled by the transfer than the declared property value."
"According to the offered claims, the order of potential acquirers is determined, after which the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokeswoman of the fund.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had information available on who had registered at the request and, as he was himself an entitled person, having purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered a property interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat payoff.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
For example, he also played a role in the causa of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he issued land in replacement refunds for which site decisions on construction projects had already been made.
At that time, for example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. of the Land Fund also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the site where the construction of the access magistrales to the Borské pole industrial area was planned.
Later, he exchanged these very cheaply with the magistrate for a house right in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to give a heavy heart to the construction project so as not to endanger it by blocking the plots.
Housing costs of households increase by a few hundred per month
From January onwards, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges, and rents for district heating and in some places will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns more each month from their wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places district heating supplies will also cost more.
The electricity taxation alone costs the households a few hundred kroner more each year.
The high electricity prices have been reduced by all the main suppliers, so the fault is the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic plants.
While gas will only be moderately expensive, this is precisely when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred kroner more per year can be expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, district heating prices vary from city to city.
Larger cities in particular are planning price increases.
For example, from January onwards, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 crowns more per month for district heating, and families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 crowns per year.
The residents of Prague, in turn, face 9 percent higher water and sewage charges in the event that the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will be removed from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2,500 homes in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree with this rent increase, the company wants to sue you in court.
Regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 homes today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, except for a good whisky, which was stolen to the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks after which drunk Czech teens under the age of fifteen need to be treated most often.
No exception is children who have to sleep their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evidenced by the experience of doctors facing similar cases in the admission of children's departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine is completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán, the chief physician of the children's department at the Central Bohemian clinic Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice.
"Whiskey, if it succeeds in stealing the father a bottle from the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief physician.
The spokeswoman of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová agrees.
"It's mostly about Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"Sometimes it was also about Slibowitz, which you take from home," said Ms Jurinová.
According to Chief Physician Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the hospital are by no means an exception.
In front of the clinic in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the paediatrics department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drowned students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
“She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first introduced with 3.5 milligrams of alcohol in her blood and in combination with ecstasy,” the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition grounds in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing about it was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor wonders.
Especially the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance when pushing with their own offspring is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence in children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol, including all the related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly drink alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains Chief Physician Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman of the hospital Motol, Ms Jurinová, by mid-November, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local department of paediatric and adolescent medicine.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home after outpatient treatment by their parents or, if necessary, by the police will not be registered.
In addition to the cases where children drink only once a bottle of liquor in the school bench, in the opinion of Mr. Pelikán there are three seasonal amplitudes on which one can rely wholly: Walpurgis Night, New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of sorrow for the bad testimony or out of joy on the holidays."
"On Walpurgis night, I also saw seven drunk children at once in the reception," Dr. Pelikán emphasizes.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who is only struggling with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches in the morning, which result from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be eliminated in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glory" experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, sometimes at least spoiling the patient's good mood by listing the cost of the treatment.
After all, transport by ambulance and the night in an emergency bed come well and gladly to a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"Occasionally, I used this as an educational tool when I directly counted on the children at the visit, what cost their drunkenness and that it may happen that they sometimes have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such fete," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures to claim from the parents the costs necessary to cure the drunken children.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of five that the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged for the transport aircraft Casa C-295M flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time this type of machine has been owned by a foreign army.
So far, they have only been seen in maneuvers or air shows abroad.
This is the flightable two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are currently preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over them last week.
When she physically expedites the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, according to the Ministry of Defense spokesman, is not yet known.
The single-seat fighter aircraft L-159, in turn, were separated from long-term stockpiled aircraft and this without further deposits and investments by the Ministry's department.
"The two-seater L-159T1 has been replaced in its current condition and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to live without two-seat fighter jets, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200-million-dollar contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four superfluous L-159s into a two-seat version.
The army took over a new aircraft in July and plans to take over the second by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has committed to enforcing the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
“The contract clearly states that EADS is the customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to train NATO countries’ pilots.
"It is therefore up to the buyer how he realizes the thing," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The Economic Newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence had not tendered for procurement at the time, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 to foreign countries.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only used 24, the rest they wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa should also have a judicial repercussion.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice for the reason that it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last of which is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is said to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that the relative length of fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty,” said Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick’s Cancer Research Institute.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health issues, added Ms. Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men had the same likelihood of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose index fingers were longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, while in men up to sixty, this decreased by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which form as early as prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research found that testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Vaclav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knew this study was fleeting, yet he did not consider the relationship between the length of the finger and the risk of cancer to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and sidewalks there is mostly stuck snow, the winter servicemen were on the axle in many places all night.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno "stands" in the direction of Prague.
This is what Novinky.CZ, the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK) said.
At kilometers 91, a truck crashed, at kilometers 93, two trucks collided, in this accident there were injured.
A few cars are also in the trench.
There are also problems at kilometer 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks have also collided.
The drivers should leave just behind Brno at kilometer 190 or drive over Brno and drive up at kilometer 182 at the town of K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
This is where kilometer-long traffic jams are formed.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that right at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns are formed in the Prosek district, and the street <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railways had to cancel seven high-speed train connections due to snow drifts.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travelers should be informed about the current situation.
The airport Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov there are three side roads that are completely impassable, in the surroundings of Brno there are snow drifts and in the surroundings of Blansko you are forced to use snow cutters on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov.
There are still three roads completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snowblowers to clear the snow.
When they will be accessible again, can not be estimated so far.
In the Hodonín region, caution is needed in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are only allowed to be scattered with inert dispersants for reasons of nature conservation, there is a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, <0xC4><0x8C>TK led.
In the Czech Republic, snow fell from two to ten centimeters, most in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimeters.
Up to 15 centimeters of fresh snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly ceases to snow.
American soldiers have a new “intelligent weapon.”
The U.S. forces have deployed a new “intelligent” weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of forces in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with an accuracy of only a few meters.
The special calibre 25 mm bullets, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed so that they can explode at any point in their ballistic trajectory, not only when impacting the target.
That is, you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to make use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically proceeds like this: he aims at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact point of view, after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he only needs to press.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"If you push, the gun recharges and shoots the bullet at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two, or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will relocate their workplaces from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specializing in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their workplaces from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park in July next year, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, there should be another 100 jobs for the group, which so far have been distributed across the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large offices in the Astro Park would be better suited to the work of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu had only been a tenant.
The managing director Bernd Wagner said: "With Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday evoked joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Markus Frank (CDU), a Frankfurt-based business deputy, said that once again a "global player" had been won.
This is a “great location commitment.”
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor of Bad Homburg Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"Of course, we have offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have been the deciding factor.
Now it is about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is showing themselves cooperatively."
Fujitsu’s house on City Hall Square and the neighbouring “Small Vertical” were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously partly used areas as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, then still connected to Siemens, moved the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt German Real Estate Opportunities Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu conuzer sees itself as the world’s third-largest IT provider.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves to Frankfurt-Niederrad from Bad Homburg, and the other subsidiaries at this location are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - the Central Association of the Electrical and Electronics Industry has its headquarters, among other things.
Amazon blocks servers - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is becoming increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Possibly there is political pressure behind this after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic tapes.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is becoming increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s search lists, is said to be in Britain, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced by Amazon server."
"Free Speech in the Land of the Free," the unveiling activists announced via Twitter on Wednesday.
Amazon has banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic tapes in order to cope with the high number of access to the documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: “Our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman investigated, CNN reported, citing Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I wish Amazon would take this action sooner in light of the previous releases of classified information by WikiLeaks," the senator said.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for the platform to be denied the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, outrageous and reckless action puts our national security at risk and endangers lives around the globe," the senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is being searched for for alleged rape by the authorities in Sweden, is on Interpol’s search list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, the exact place is known to be Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats.
“There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange.”
That is why Assange is rightly afraid for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The WikiLeaks founder will remain hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said – apparently ironically – on television that Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
The White House and Assange had a swap.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had called for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s resignation if she was responsible for recent spying calls on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its one website."
The U.S. government is now fully testing the protection of its databases.
Russell Travers, the deputy director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Action, was appointed as a special envoy, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that have become necessary after WikiLeaks’ disclosure of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced its intention to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be endangered by the WikiLeaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if it becomes necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the Gelatiere and from the Gelataio.
The gelatier, in German somewhat ancient the ice cream confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream making art.
With a spatula, the gelato picks up the ice cream from the fridge, smears it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, don't miss the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice cream university was established by the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several days of special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the on-site ice cream parlour.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply venture onto the slippery ice of their vague longings.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years in a nerve-wracking job wants to bag something of her own.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the icing on the cake of the national and overall southern superstructure in his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to the production seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he opens a cock on the machine and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk ice creams.
Immediately, the lecturer is assaulted with questions: Can you make ice cream only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own desire for experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the Zeitgeist.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it sacks up, and the customer bites on loud ice pellets.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste of the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or in the candy store.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you into dozens of flavored additives."
“You should just experiment.”
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or with the ice cream from the white base, which with eggs turns into yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to the ice machines.
Luciano has them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also be undertaken for the fruit ice creams.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream produces the working group that uses more fruits, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture will highlight the taste of a gelato properly, says Luciano.
Ice making is a computational task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wines use it to measure the oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, tables make it easier to calculate.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the base mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously beaten creamy and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small breakdowns do not fail.
The Brazilian Gustavo treats himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fruit puree when the oversized bar mixer gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in the twilight
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is undermined by the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well,” said Christoph Then, CEO of Testbiotech, in Munich.
The head of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have also been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the EFSA testing regulations for genetic plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then.
The EFSA rules are word-like with Ilsi’s position papers, deceiving the industry’s handwriting, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has complained of a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking EFSA manager recently had no conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently unveiled personnel links between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians have made clear.
However, the EFSA cannot identify any conflict of interest.
“All serious data, including those from industry, is used as long as they are of high professional quality,” the statement said.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contacts with industry.
You would have to disclose them.
Kuiper agrees to work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This sees itself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and politics - including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts like Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding tests and that the reaction of genetically modified plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know, for example, what genetically modified corn does on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?", Then asks accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck thinks so.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the US, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would usually not be published.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck claims.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell also took care of some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: in September, the excavators had arrived and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands protested against S21, the billion-dollar downgrade of the station.
When construction stopped, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't go away."
“A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy.”
When he saw one, he smelled like a cigarette.
What he's going to do with the chunks, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old trades with old stones.
He bought all those who attacked at the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden floor that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when he was in the newspapers in September that he bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn’t do anything for the demolition.
And if it were to happen, it would be the most reasonable if the stones were to be reused.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos squares with them, priced between 6.50 and 14 euros.
As a memorial, but some also in the hope of being able to return it in the event of reconstruction.
500 tons had been bought by Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half are still in the woods, the rest have already been sold.
Garden owner, landscaper, housebuilder.
They had come from everywhere and had towed away what the trunk and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones have long since been transformed into "Mauerle" or into boundaries of herbal beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
“It wouldn’t be the political component.”
He gets into his off-road vehicle, taking a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and graduated, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
He stores 40000 tons of stones.
He collects his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the republic.
It's slowing down.
In the snow are artfully carved sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, it swarms.
"My favorite stone."
The road goes up through the forest.
It points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The quads once belonged to the stands of the Stuttgarter Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the cathedral of Sankt Blasien, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be carved by hand and moved with simple bottle hoists and ox carts, he becomes very awe-inspiring.
"It would be a scandal if you shredded something like that."
He has not become rich, certainly not rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, besides, up in the forest, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower, and a gardener have settled down.
"We're working hard, but it's satisfying," says the residual valuer.
Soon he will be in Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent struggle for high-potentials
There's a lot of pressure on the buffet.
16 students are crowding around for salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automaker Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are to simplify the car of the future together with VW developers - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates in the lecture halls as early as possible before they enter the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements about the achievements of their students, they try to spot and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company is recruiting the talents.
A young lady from the HR department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with the VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is in charge of the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can simultaneously meet students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not uncommon.
The new thing is that the students are being bullied so offensively.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
Instead, they have to pay attention to themselves and, in particular, to highly qualified workers.
Above all, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering jobs were left unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt where participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the US next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG stores and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When hoeing and stabbing around the high potentials at the universities, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Just a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta, the bill seems to be paying off.
"To this day, we have been in contact with all participants in a similar campaign last year."
“Some are close to graduating and want to apply to us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct booing on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also go to the pirsch at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
“About at Intersolar,” reports Sitha Stübe, HR manager at Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the younger generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company website.
"It's very difficult to fill vacant positions right now."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not popular with solar specialists.
For this, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large corporation often can't offer that," says HR manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job searching.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotional opportunities are other decisive factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual leaderboard of German employers.
To do this, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also bring benefits to job seekers.
"I think that applicants are particularly looking for external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In the industry jargon, it is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within your own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they would advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances by themselves.
"It's like a game with a gang," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida.
A similar ban has been issued by the government in Washington - and thus definitively revoked its previous plans.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which should apply at least for the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster, which cost the lives of eleven workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents want to reduce the dependence of the United States on oil supplies from abroad.
Who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not yet been definitively clarified.
The focus of the criticism is on the British energy company BP, which is facing billions of dollars in demand.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drill stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out another disaster.
At present, the competent supervisory authority, which had fallen into disrepute after numerous corruption allegations, is under fundamental reform.
At the same time, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the volume of production in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry,” is the result of a current industry survey by the consulting firm BDO – even before Wednesday’s drill ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows exactly what will change with regulation.”
Investment in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like the gas station: billions of liters of leaked crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari is good at it.
"Don't worry," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to photograph a boy wading to the chest in the water with the veils surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water gloss, the scene looks almost pretty.
The fact that brown crude oil swamps float beneath the surface is not visible.
She used to collect shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the sluggish flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil poured into the huge wetland from a ruptured pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fish-rich waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps permeated by river courses, the whole extent of the devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of light water, the motorboat whisks up brown broth, whoever dives his hand into the water pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude from the ground like black liquorice bars, sadly leaving the palm trees to hang their wedges.
Bird swarms, as they are customary in wetlands, are sought in vain: As soon as the outboarder is silent, ghostly peace spreads in the former paradise, smelling like a gas station.
“What is happening here is ecological warfare,” says Celestine Akpobari darkly: “We are living in constant danger to health.”
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been contested for decades: here more than 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe invaded, here in the 1980s organized the first resistance with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
The company is still banned from returning to Ogoniland today: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of the triple size of Switzerland with over 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the situation is too unstable for the Group.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames protrude like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the holes much too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the medula.
Again and again such a drill head breaks apart, Akpobari thinks, then a constant stream of crude oil drains into the water.
More than two billion litres have flown into the delta’s ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year after year, the amount of oil as it penetrated into the sea off Alaska at the crash of the supertanker “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago – one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is to blame for the ongoing eco-GAU is disputed about this.
While the Shell group blames sabotage and organised oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see pounding drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main culprits.
In 2008, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused Shell of imposing significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world: The rate of defects on the pipelines alone is "many times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that from a distance looks like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop in the open air, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are split-naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later drips out at the end of the pipe kerosene and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres per day: "That brings us 34,000 naira" - about 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illicit cookers can still undercut the ridiculously low price of diesel with just under 40 Euro cents per liter: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: This is how the country loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil daily, according to experts throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a tiny fraction of the provisionally intermediate raw material is being processed illegally: the lion’s share is filled by organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, in tankers and skewed it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate about whether the environmental disaster is more due to the upheaval of the population or the lax mode of production purely academic.
“If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had not destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries.”
In the meantime, however, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell in particular has been destroyed to such an extent that only a deduction from the Group would be considered: "Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese turn out to be better."
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s high time you disappeared,” says the muscular oilman.
"The soldiers can come any minute."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special forces unit, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful bribe.
Like all Nigerians, soldiers mainly from the north of the country also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn thing has brought our country on the dog in every way," Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous construction defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a serious security problem.
Investigators in the investigation of an emergency landing machine discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas is going to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency landing Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November apparently had much more luck than previously known: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified in its investigations a major safety problem with the engines of some A380s - and now warns of a possible construction failure.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In the case of an oil hose connection, it could create fatigue cracks and leaks, according to an ATSB statement published on Thursday.
This could have led to “a catastrophic engine failure.”
Rolls-Royce-produced engines in 20 A380 aircraft were affected.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a grounds for action with an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing her to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline will demand compensation for the incident in early November.
During the fire of the engine, parts were loosened and the wings were damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines worldwide will now have to be replaced.
The Australian investigators announced that they will carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Snow has fallen almost all over the country overnight.
On many roads there is chaos, trains and flights fall out.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: In icy temperatures, almost the entire republic snows on Thursday at night - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east are some 15 centimeters thick snow covers.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous operation, but was not finished with the constantly new snow.
In addition, heavy gusts swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal.
In Saxony, the snow drifts on the highways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the meteorological center Meteomedia, in Saxony Switzerland, the alarm level was violet – the highest level at all.
Partly 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused droughts.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the roads.
On the A2, snow and wind caused traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfalls affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, overthrown trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and turnstiles are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE to Munich had to stop its journey.
The 165 passengers were supplied with wool blankets, food and drinks by firefighters and rescuers on the train.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
At major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman of the flight information center, several cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt.
The winter service is in continuous operation.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still almost 400 field beds available for them.
There were accidents on many streets on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver died in the collision with a train at a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here too, a truck was caught at a railway crossing because the vehicle stopped.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train – the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she overturned her car on a smooth road near Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will swirl up even in light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by rapid and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - in places up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Just recently, Deutsche Bank has made its corporate headquarters pretty: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rises, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes citing a spokesperson.
The spokesperson did not state the reasons for the planned sale.
“We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then give it back,” he said.
Germany’s largest credit institution is giving up its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investors of an in-house fund and subsequently expensively refurbished.
The energetic conversion swallowed around 200 million euros, according to the data.
A sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have now been renamed "Greentowers", according to the newspaper at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn the death of their friends
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, a violent explosion had occurred in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were spilled underground.
A probe had been dropped into the accident shaft, but had discovered no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue personnel could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, authorities and experts had assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not been recovered so far.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a commemoration.
Ten thousand people had gathered in the bright sunshine in Greymouth, New Zealand’s South Island.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honor of the spilled miners, 29 tables were set up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the comrades were shown.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags were blown at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He could not finish with his son's death until he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was spilled in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin had also been spilled.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, the glowing temperatures inside the mine will begin to cool, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-examines old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he filmed "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and ranks his opponents with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero has liked to use more rabid killing methods and his enemies are already living out of the mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as it is actually called, does not say a word about the whole film, and the other characters can at most be ripped to one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, silence and revel in the eeriely beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which provides the backdrop of the Viking world from about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinemas with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Good if a movie has multiple audiences, only a pity if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but stoically refuses to make his works available to the mainstream with a bit more humor or a bit less brutality to the arthouse.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be discouraged by the squirting brain mass and guts.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, an eye breaks off with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and is stuck for an eternity in slumber and fog before the crew apparently arrives in America and keeps silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is a pity especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade is hidden a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, it is all atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
There is no escape for the viewer.
Refn gives him barely a moment of relaxation and slowly closes his throat with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy, faithful to one eye, preserves something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the messenger of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for those already corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate and admire, to anger, excitement and amazement.
It's an experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position on this - nor does it allow controls.
At midnight from September 5 to 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attack a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in the quadrilateral, hidden in a valley draining from the electricity.
According to a briefing by the CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium, from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology of the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA performed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By computer animation, she revealed where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also provided photos showing the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was just before commissioning, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little more is known than then, yes, the riddles became rather bigger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but saw little evidence that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an "alleged reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was of having a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer only lapidary that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
The debris of the alleged “unused military building” was quickly removed by the Syrians and the site was thoroughly levelled.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from a Member State immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA dismissed this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it – just like the satellite images.
In addition, it denies the controllers a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, said in a statement.
The investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and "increasingly develops into a serious credibility problem for the agency," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area overlooking the IAEA.
The IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and still exist unlike it.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed what facilities they are, or what function they have, or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these sites and found a building complex near Masyaf, most likely one of the suspicious objects, on satellite images.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base – precisely on this grounds, Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the US to spy on military facilities.
After all, the nuclear detectives had drawn attention to the facilities by a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three sites and the quadrilateral on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be “related to fuel production.”
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium should later be separated for the bomb, there are plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could hold valuable traces was stored at the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to know where the rubble has gone.
Just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria investigated in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste depot, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from the orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks at the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
In addition, diplomats say the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets – only the effort shows how much interest the inspectors have.
However, Damascus also ironed this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna even a year ago reassured that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter has no high urgency, for example US ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting into play so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of “an option I am open to in the future,” but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this path: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are far from eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat should consider, "What if they find nothing at all in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still-unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much more about it, but that’s enough for restlessness.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim woman, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, after which some of the filming days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary shortly afterwards.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women Victims of War wrote to Jolie about the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador of the UN Refugee Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, her organization has recommended that Jolie be fired as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who got to read her script, after some back-and-forth granted a filming permit for Sarajevo - it's not quite clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, has worked with a lot of effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
In terms of content, however, it remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film circulates on the Internet, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the outbreak of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim woman, is abducted into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds very different to the variant "rape victims fall in love with Tortureknecht".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that's for sure.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, was “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can bring peace to her: by illegally putting the script on the net, as so many before.
Nothing like away from here
It’s finally going to be a good time for the Irish again.
No trace of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans jolted with joy at loud music, they pounded with their feet.
The Bailey Pub in South Ireland is shaking because players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance into beer cups – and hit.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there is 500 Euro prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist don’t really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to have fun while distracting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mulch feeling with it," he says.
“It’s so far away from home and I don’t have a job there yet.”
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a ruck, pull her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," the young man says and smiles.
Due to poor perspectives at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, and his brother Colin now works as an IT consultant in London.
The boys are leaving: Like the Tanners, many families are on the island.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts at the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, sadness is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly preoccupying the young, well-educated Irish, for whom it has hitherto only gone uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
Meanwhile, three in ten women and men under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from young immigrants complaining: "Everything is going down the river in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation with it."
"The last one, please turn off the lights."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future rising because the government is only wrestling its eyes and offers no more prospects for young people.
“They’re reducing minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy on how to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students hang out from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to positively occupy the topic.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of working abroad.
"For professional beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On its website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known what it feels like to build something elsewhere for six months.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are currently raising a fashion house.
In January we will continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan's home is now rarely seen, because he makes extra shifts to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I’m making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m pretty much never going to be again.”
He laughs a bit embarrassed and walks through chilled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>380,000 four years ago - 100 percent credit financed.
"It was crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions," he says.
Is he afraid that the loan might go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea, and says, "I don't have children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The civil engineer does not like the lamentation that he hears often at the moment.
"No one has to go hungry - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe that makes us feel Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
“After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply.”
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let’s open up the future and see how life goes elsewhere.
After all, he has a few years of work in London and why shouldn’t things go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that really disturbs him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could turn into a farewell party.
"Don't just have too many emotions," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
“Goodbye, that sounds scary.”
"Let's call it a go-away party, quite relaxed, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democracy Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results came from the Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly eye-catching in this year’s survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by around 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since the strong collapse last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region’s most populous countries, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country’s democratic practice, which is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Graph 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% their government, both of which are similar to last year’s, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This may have been due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% again this year.)
However, there are strong mood differences from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes increased, this is less the case.
It is only the second time since the start of the survey that many Latin American respondents see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or a family member were victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the figures have fallen, reaching their lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economies: approximately 71% of respondents supraregionally stated that the private sector is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are in favour of a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the U.S. as the most influential country, with this role being taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An electoral flap
No one expected that the elections on November 28 in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the voters who rushed to help the afflicted country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot papers in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Voting rooms opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless due to the January earthquake, roamed around in search of a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded the cancellation of the election results because of an alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election as "quite good in many respects."
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected run-off is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first-lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who receives little or no voter approval, is declared the winner of the polls by the electoral commission, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims still live in tents, low voter turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to lack of organization.
Just before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for the election had not yet been issued.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves share the same view.
Hidden in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of her husband, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that drove her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, the highest since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help her to be re-elected next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also steered economic policy after the election of his wife, often drafted budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further disappointment.
Some regime critics from the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian slapped another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to talk about it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget is now valid for next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money at his own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and trade union wage demands - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be its main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently beautified the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate path now?
She has called on the private sector and trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth spurt due to a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for a deal with the donors from the Paris Club, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is customary elsewhere.
But last month, Economics Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide “technical support” in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like the first step towards purging the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband after her term ends.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely fed up with Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been brought to them will have ebbed down.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly undo many of her husband’s political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all eligible voters, set out to elect mayors and councillors in the five city districts, a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed relations with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only briefly.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) appoints three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocates Taiwan’s greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes, and the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual occurrences in Taiwan such as truck convoys with riot makers, flag-turning mass parades and barely clad dancers.
There was even the compulsory, mysterious attempt at murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
when a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack hampered the election and put the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their factual independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time, the DPP also avoided fomenting the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, would like to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese are in favour of his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of enticing Taiwan back into the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It is better to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he strongly advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai’s rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai found great approval as the DPP's presidential candidate, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she too is able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans to create an idea forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly declared that her party was offering a “trusted alternative” to Mas’s accelerated approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he explained that the DPP candidates would have done better at insisting on Taiwan’s independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s intervention, the DPP has a hard time choosing its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing scissors between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reshape his cabinet and local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only limited in favour of a reapproach.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no going back."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly named Newcomer of the Year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony, when the 26-year-old jazz bass player and singer was nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination seems a little unusual, but it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released no more than three albums prior to the release of the album, with which he became known to the public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward, and with her enthusiastic voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be easily compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination comes closest to Spaldings.
The Vijay Iyer Trio's album "Historicity" was also nominated in the instrumental albums category, making this favourite of the critics a huge success.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a ravenous New Orleans favorite and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the Contemporary Jazz category, which usually features albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin, and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Societe, a fierce steampunk musician, received well-deserved attention in the big group category, competing against Billy Child's ensemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award feature a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
Leading the list is Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", which was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year – Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Artworks" by the Orchestra.
In the opera category, Bergs "Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra of Wales and Choir of the National Orchestra no.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen on January 4.
The 30-minute play is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinenkonzert" received a nomination in the instrumental solo category with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New Yorker Metropolis Ensemble.
"I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the Orchestral Performance category for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Temecula mosque gains approval of planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula came after a five-hour, often heated public hearing with the unanimous agreement of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahai, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley.
"As an American, I'm proud of that."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00 and discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with votes on both sides fairly evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
"There is no America anymore," he said.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty lies dead in the sand."
“America is at the end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, for example near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
Its community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a water filtering plant manufacturer.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style is to have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
“This makes it very special, even though it’s almost a kind of ‘foreign’ way of life,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which will appear in the online issue of the journal Science on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital – carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California’s Mono Lake continues to grow even when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible," Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the report, said.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems, organisms can use other elements to trigger biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both might be able to replace one element with the other.
“The toxicity of arsenic is primarily due to its chemical similarity to phosphorus.”
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"However, the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus, it gets into our biochemical system, where it smears almost everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to increasing arsenic concentration and it adapted and grew.
While the microbe grows better in phosphorus, the fact that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has been no working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found, according to Thursday's Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office.
The four exhibiting dogs—two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis—disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, says Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is, the dogs are well,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not give any exact information on the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
“The investigation is still ongoing.”
"We don't want to say that anymore," Whitmore explains.
"We're following some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were uninjured, according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek wanted to introduce to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should take part in other competitions on the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple’s nearly one-month tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often spend the night in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car as stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised anyone who could give an indication of the Corgis a finder's reward. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's wages would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "preparing" believer plan to repay the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so nothing will stand in the way of the restart of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million loan to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself raises $75 million, is heading the company, and the funding is scheduled for mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with an order from investment bank Moelis & Co., the company’s management, which was struggling with interest payments of $300 million per year, to help solve its financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve the financial worries of MGMs and pay out the studio’s more than 140 trustees took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from scratch when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debates and internal disputes.
If MGM has officially passed bankruptcy over the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 per month to run the company, receives a $4 million “success bonus.”
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released in theaters in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio will need a separate bond ranging from $265 million to $275 million for its financial stake in these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has financed approximately 18% of the MGM loan, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies resulted in no results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console, both of which can tear a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronics toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us, and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s law had come into effect. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and cost slightly less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, the most well-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have a wider offering.
More and more button cell-powered toys are coming on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, the size of guinea pigs, that sing a note when you press on their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by pressing repeatedly you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pushing, you will not be able to stop.
For a combination of message and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children over 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays like 'Simon Says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel blocking, it masters the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are an 80s child, you certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children over 3), with a bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a better knower with car correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard, but the games included on it are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which, after Leapfrog’s first major revision of the Leapster series, features a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children over 8), the five blocks are no larger than a match box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together in words before time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figure pack ($5 for children aged 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
This can be roller skates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children over 5) is no larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he endures a lot.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are becoming softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a city square, checking his nervous subordinates, giving orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan – China’s robust guardians of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their propensity to violence – to impress spectators.
"Standing straight!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely out of teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four decent hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped loops.
"To me, they look average," Mr. Tang remarks contemptuously.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low-keyness: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled around an improperly positioned food truck and stared at the operator until he packed and left the square after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with a population of 680,000, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the city police forces and have been selected for their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are supposed to give the coarse-sleeping police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Rightly so, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce the municipal laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beat a spectator to death as he filmed them using his cell phone as they beat down a protest against a dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon merchant suffered brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China attacking street traffickers.
"Chengguan is scaring the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a “real thorough cleansing.”
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district looked for eight female recruits per ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonious facial features" were searched.
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends when you reach the age of 26.
According to officials, the activity is too physically strenuous for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official told the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their outward appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's city administration, does not agree with this description,
but admitted that in China size requirements in job ads for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this can be equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurements need not apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lameness or hunches here," said Mr. Zheng.
“Your image would not be good.”
Liu Yi, who is patrolling Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple rolls and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn’t feel sexist that so much importance was placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the ditches, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the short hiring, as they have more ambitious career plans than just scaring merchants through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bike before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so many times!" explains Ms. Xu to a merchant who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than exhausting.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in recreational sales.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchants’ goods, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten offenders by reporting them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public hostilities, to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after rumours circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that had been repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, contrary to the regulations.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials with grim face paved the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, was left behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we talk verbally.”
"But sometimes physically," Mr. Li explains soberly.
"Most of the time people start arguing."
Prosecutor will not prosecute Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the allegations raised against him following his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to lobby her husband, the Senator’s lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the heaviest allegation against Senator Ensign, the Nevada Republican, who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012 until the scandal that made headlines nationwide and dampened his career.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate’s ethics committee could still impose a disciplinary sentence.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigation against Senator Ensign had been stopped and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice; in their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents first revealed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his constituents, was helping to lucrative orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as Treasurer of Ensigns during an election campaign.
Ensign made contact with some political friends to get Hampton to work, and according to the documents and interrogations, he took over Hampton's lobbying for them after hiring.
Since Hampton was on Ensign’s election team recently, he was not allowed to lobby his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on the revolving door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, "it appears to be a collusion and a violation of the revolving door statutes," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients who are targeted by the government.
While the Department of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics attorneys said the ministry seems very cautious in taking up political charges following a variety of defeats pursued by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrifying," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose goal is to combat corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Mr. Ensign’s chief defense officer, Paul Coggins, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, informing him that the ministry would not file any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign's attorneys had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of the talks between the Ministry of Justice and me, only to say that we believe we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to close the investigation into a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Group, according to which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said there had not been enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that after the company continued to lobby Mr. Hampton, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, telling him that he was "tapping" at the Department of the Interior for a matter.
Mr. Ensign also had lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton had stopped lobbying.
Last year, when information about this affair first came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican rank.
After many months of not being noticed, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of police investigations, his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator expressed hope that the Ethics Committee will very quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and cease its investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work at the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tilted away in the riots in the courtroom.
Every minute they sent their reports of horrific witness testimony via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape process and children chained to beds in a house that went on fire.
On Thursday, the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's verdict on the death sentence issued by the jury falls.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed applications with courts that outline the reasons for an appeal and which will employ the courts for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense coverage of the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – has led to a “circus atmosphere” and such widespread, immediate penetration of insurgent details that the jury has been inadmissibly influenced by public outrage.
This appeal could lead the Appeal Courts to consider whether the new technologies make new rules in the courtroom necessary.
"As I have experienced during this trial, I believe it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects everyone's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes's chief defense attorney.
The chairman judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, briefly rejected the motions by decision last week when he said that the New Media would be “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on the matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 ruling, the United States Supreme Court upheld the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath who allegedly killed his wife, saying in his decision that there had been a “carnival atmosphere in the courtroom” because of the New Media.
Some believe that the TV series and feature film "On the Run" is based on this crime.
Some attorneys say court appeals, which look at Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communications from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There’s a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in trials persecuted by a broad public,” said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appeals courts might be intrigued by the idea that restricting immediate communication out of the courtroom could make trials more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’s lawyers put forward to discuss for years, thus delaying a conviction.
The defendants also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been pre-condemned when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them horrific crime scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, aged 48, and her breeders, Hayley, aged 17, and Michaela, aged 11, had filled them with disgust.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecution and that he had inadmissibly put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a petition they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of governor and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotion over the case.
"Such a daily influx of media whistlers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "hasn't been seen before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide."
Her focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more insidious than reports that are reported more slowly is a tech-hostile look that impoverishes coverage of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that courts of appeal were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes needed adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this allegation.
In their appeal, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling, which upheld Dr. Sheppard’s conviction for reporting, and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separating?
After a campaign of slander and negativity, little politeness has erupted in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before one quickly returns to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders did not bring a breakthrough in the major issues faced during the so-called "lame duck session", the session at the end of a term in which no decisions are made.
According to all that is heard, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides or a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan point gathering.
The public meeting of the President’s Deficit Commission on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to separate the members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one demands from the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the Tuesday meeting itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Last but not least, the November elections in Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
“No question, the tone has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions that die again.
And that's good."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and nobody supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to obtain some or all of them, whether temporary or permanent.
Likewise, a compromise on the increase in unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich while denying support to unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, the optimism has risen that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that a successful collaboration on urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical – and this skepticism is shared by many – which leads to genuine cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, as a preliminary fight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their formation.
No matter how concerned the Republican leaders may be that they are playing too high, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and overturn health care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the first reactions to the Deficit Commission’s recommendations, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, raising retirement age and lowering government spending.
Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own opinion, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan the official recommendation and they are struggling very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest opposition is to be found in the elected representatives of the body, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on the state budget, taxes, and health care system, followed later by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay close attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partiality and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than it was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a much far-reaching 2012 election.
From this point of view, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that still separate the two.
Leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the “cleptocracy” and it is passing on part of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, according to a memo issued by the US embassy in Russia in February.
Both the police and the state security services are extorting high protection funds so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of authority” – takes its share of the money that the ladders are moving upwards.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its homepage on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow’s mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won numerous libel charges against such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as the Ambassador's report says, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard of that being done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call it 'disturbed' and to conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo reads.
Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, literally meaning "roof" or protection) that extends across the police, state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the prosecutor's office as well as across the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is top priority."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Lastly, ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is collecting money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "declared that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly before - due to the one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken on several occasions about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The message memo contains descriptions of men who went to the Kremlin with suitcases that were presumably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, in an interview recently.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, it estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The unveiling of the memo of the American embassy, which happened late in the evening after Moscow, will certainly trigger displeasure within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s mistakes, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such unethical ways, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Confront the Past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the Butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the government, long-time supporters are being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book telling the story of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, a UN and Cambodian community tribunal sentenced a former Khmer Rouge member to 35 years in prison for the first time when it sentenced former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch.
With each of these developments, the fear among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs grew, complicated their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into the society of Cambodia.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that is investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It even divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary waged the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok drew the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to surrender to the government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to rural Cambodia’s tiresome poverty, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few Khmer Rouge elite officials retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, illiterate peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the regime's utopian agricultural ideology."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to trial.
The mandate of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told Cambodia’s Documentation Center commissioner that she was in charge of the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers were believed to have died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
“If there were no more persecution, there would be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court charged more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center said.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer era means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that as everything can understand."
The center created the first government-approved school book about the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people are convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek mountains, a path overgrown by shrubs and dirty with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tyres.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the roadside, said she doesn’t know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will lay down a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees not to further collect weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure global nuclear materials, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-capable uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That prepared the stage for Wednesday’s agreement to remove the rest of the material – according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The deal seems to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s April “Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations” that had ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally capable of weapons, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... We will not make dirty bombs out of it and we will not sell it to anyone.”
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus nevertheless approached the United States a few months ago when it indicated interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Belarus’ uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second run was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money going into Belarusian research using weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy ministry representative working on Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Disclosure Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-enabled uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus plans to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she explained.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners across Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador to Madrid.
This reflects the documents unveiled by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily El País (by cable), adding that the former deputy head of government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are being properly monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe on aid for human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted the Council's report "have met Zapatero in the offside" and reaffirmed that Spain had nothing to hide on this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" so as not to "be surprised unprepared," Aguirre reports via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, even though the government has little influence because it is in the hands of the judges."
Prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, stated in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts for discreet handling between governments," Aguirre lamented.
At a luncheon in March 2007, attended by U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely keen on their independence and are doing what they think is appropriate," he had instructed his staff to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments in order to ease the tension."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP’s approach to this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on an indication that the U.S. government has tolerated or deliberately ignored Zapatero's actions, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could negatively affect the U.S. government," he stressed.
The child killer admits that she complained on the internet about the "mushroom" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in the Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least a friend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, one must know her love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of witnesses from her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never had him perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the job market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be inferred that their love relationship broke up and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he found it good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free to do and let what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her if everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother", a dubious intention, considering their bad relationship.
There will be another mail in July.
As she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
“On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, he is not.”
“On the one hand, he’s with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day.”
She talks about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have fewer expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A giant kiss from César asking me when you'll be coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the email, and if he wants to, he'll find me, that shit."
On the 30th one more: "The boy's fine, he's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots me in front of money."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, which is now locked down and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer."
"Terror a la gallega (heading) ".
The last man to live with her, a sworn hunting supervisor, declares to have remorse because he feels guilty.
He can’t believe it all happened because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners of Justice in Menorca to the Provincial Prison of Palma.
Duty defender, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not remember the course of the matter, "and she did not intend to do any harm to the little one."
Previously, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and putting his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing its gaze on the parliamentary elections - preferentially or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as that in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 general election, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this rising tendency – a result of the redirection of the PSC’s voting share and the binding of the PP’s electorate – should continue, the PP’s analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 MPs, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (out of 25).
These calculations prove the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People’s Party, the ERC would lose one deputy – currently it has three – while ICV could hold its deputy or win one.
However, should the election calendar be maintained, the next municipal election date will be May 2011. Even then, the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to socialist supremacy, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the City Council of Barcelona, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists cannot achieve a majority or resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is no surprise that this party will lose its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona, in which it would have to win 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its vote share in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they will be able to play the leading role in Tarragona’s transformation, where they had ruled with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party saw a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell procured Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by police officers of the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, which comprised various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the 10 bombings in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister attributes great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure that with “Operation Kampai” the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda has been “weakened” worldwide and “so much their ability to act”.
The researchers estimate that in the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their “fighters” could cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impunity.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also participated in the investigation. It is not to be excluded that in the next few days there will be similar attacks on the territory of the EU as that which was carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another operation was carried out in Thailand, in which Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Butt were arrested.
They had led the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourist passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued in the name of men between the ages of 25 and 45 and had to be valid for several more years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigation circles underline that until now no links have been detected between those arrested in Catalonia and the Bombay attack, although the author of this attack, "Lashkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that several days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent by means of a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "commando", which ended the lives of 106 people.
Police have confiscated extensive documentation.
PP demands from Mas a deferment of the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present to Artur Mas her own terms and conditions in support of his accession as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are not different from those already presented during the election campaign and can be combined with the priority of economic recovery and the omission of his regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial balance point.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party reliably turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 MPs she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the CiU bourgeois-regionalist party is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to abstain from voting when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP, but the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the party chairman of the PPC is concerned, it demands that in support of taking office "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, be posted behind.
Both political leaders have in common that they want to make the regional administration’s built-up political apparatus leaner and abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations for the accession of Mas are being dealt with by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home reaffirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the elderly home in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
The caretakers of the care home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference, in which they highlighted the damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the caregiver who had killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible during his work - had caused to the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in court alongside his lawyer, Joan Cañada, announcing that "La Caritat wants to prosecute the person responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a social loss of reputation because it had not detected the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high compensation amount, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies – former patients of the nursing home – because he suspected that no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and diseases.
The head of La Caritat denied this point, stating that "lack of action could not at any time have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “there would be no evidence in the litigation for negligent acts of any person other than the accused.”
Baptized as the "Death Angel", he confessed to 11 murders yesterday and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and one and a half months later murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of different sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said that staff access to the medicines was difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail in six out of nine crimes committed to free patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the lab tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it out from the inside by giving them bleach liquor, as he confessed to having done with three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, there is no faith in the nurse’s statements, not even in the number of confessed murders, which could well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to ECB President Trichet’s threat that “markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
The risk premiums of the euro peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be mistaken and that the euro has barely gained points, which is a cause for concern.
Yesterday’s events are typical of an illiquid market that recovers as it collapses, but due to the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor is far from losing his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to pull back tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to buy sovereign debt, as it was ineffective, and for the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures, with only one week of indefinite access.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the bond purchase program to continue and send out a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of yesterday’s markets will be thrown back again, and if we persist in insisting that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, where the bank reaffirmed that it would not consider buying sovereign debt and that markets would collapse, this story could repeat tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, thus provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year sovereign titles in Portugal was fairly weak.
The state asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points over the whole curve, reflecting a change in perception of the markets according to Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about 10,000 million in the short term and possibly another 15,000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost credibility after not recognizing the issue with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must get parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday, and Ireland remains a source of uncertainty as it still does not have sufficient support.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of heads of state and government on December 14, where political unity is needed to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the government and the Spanish central bank reacted quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which is why we are relying on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our debt restructuring capability.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now not only being counts, but also the appearance."
Courage, we can do it!
The Chairman of the Board of Owls, at the request of his children, opposes the shareholders’ meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of the companies Owls and El Enebro, does not faint.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the company's gurre, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them "absolutely null and void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing legal action for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not appear to be willing to give in to the control of El Enebro’s institutions in his legal dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders’ meeting of 18 January this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders’ meeting of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of Madrid’s commercial court number 2 for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the lap of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The summoning of the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders’ meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to officially recognize through legal cunning, fraudulent machinations and legal abuse the annulled Assembly of January 18".
This argument is the basis for challenging the assembly in retrospect to declare it "absolutely null and void."
The same protagonists, who hide in discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully in June to convene an assembly by judicial means.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right of use over 51% of the capital.
That is the real background of the case, which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been shaped by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe of speed.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply ascending career during the last seasons, in the final sprint last November, everyone was betting on Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari victory.
Without wanting to diminish the abilities of German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into its hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This computer program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The objective is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull can "in a few hours, almost in real time" design and perform the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 an average of ten technicians worked in the race stalls, who could introduce no more than three or four improvements in a season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly skilled young people who use high-performance computer systems to perform analyses and any possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens manager stated that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula One team is allowed to spend on its races in one season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers away from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are heavily restricted.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The workforce consists of 580 people, including two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull’s true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts into the services of his participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose notoriety is equal to zero.
Steve Nevey, Chief Technology Officer at the plant, said five years ago it was still possible to say that R&D advances in racing cars contributed 50 percent to the win and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed, with the technology accounting for 85 percent of the success, while the pilots’ contribution is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers, because they "are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will open 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a network of 20 stores with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees to this initiative with the already existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP España, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted store on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to establish 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of them in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming reopenings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice president, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, said that the store opening philosophy is always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to the touch). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training store staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and highlighted that the exclusive point of sale network was intended to "optimize the customer service and advice of small and micro-enterprises when purchasing and afterwards, even the packaging."
The Barcelona store has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way, we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' its rival a million customers in three years
Jaime Guardiola, the Managing Director of Banco Sabadell, is more optimistic than other managers, believing that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but he initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it anticipates a fall in interest rates that banks are trying to offset by raising fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a subject that remains to be explored.
Sabadell has found the way to take advantage of the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if you deduct the customers that the bank will lose - that is the big challenge that this bank faces, because so far it has devoted more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year, it added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share among retail customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Few banks dare to set and publish goals in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all banks’ plans worldwide.
This year, Sabadell will complete its Optima strategy, which was initially designed to last for three years, but which was extended by one financial year as a result of the market situation.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At an APIE-organized breakfast, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain will only emerge “slowly” from the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities – which penalizes interest margins – will fade, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions in order to maintain liquidity will already be diverted to the price of loans as compensation for diminishing profit margins.
“The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the loans.”
"We didn't turn the rooster off, but the interest rate differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
On Thursday, Banesto issued the order to its branch network to restrict the allocation of long-term loans and increase the interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco Días of November 22 and 27).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the strategy to "increase the fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategy is based on organic growth, even if the group does not, as always, exclude corporate business.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently “increasing enormously” and does not rule out some Spanish financial institutions slipping into red numbers.
He believes that FROB can replace the money market in case of capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be circulated, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing can be achieved through repo transactions and thus catch the crisis.
CECA excludes a second wave of mergers of savings banks
The director-general of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a wave of mergers between the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the Spanish savings banks began to concentrate, several savings banks insisted on not taking part in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was rather adjustments."
"Most of it is finished. It may be that instead of seventeen we have thirteen or fourteen, but all the important processes are already completed. They were controlled by Banco de España, which strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was completed as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process that was set in the past, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he emphasized.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, thus fulfilling the Basel agreement," he emphasized.
Olavarrieta stated that "there are a number of inappropriate opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed nonsense and nonsense" because "Banco de España urges us to close by the end of the year."
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the whole world, and added that those who doubt this would do so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic cycle, we need not "concern" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that Spanish banks had passed very well the stress tests conducted by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but at the same time it has set conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, ranging from tax cuts for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the abolition of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>426 in support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former prime minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person in charge, which has summoned the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is to be expected that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany is adopting a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German Mark - although it sounds more like science fiction at the moment - is supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a restructuring of the euro according to German proposals, which means more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that violate the rules; possibly the cessation of payments of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been showing itself for some time now, so there are no excuses.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first indication of the divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was for the Central European country when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were absolutely against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out with a clear position: she calls for a reform of the European Union agreements to enable the rescue of a country, while at the same time requiring private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because it pushed the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
In the coming months, we will be taking part in the reform of the European Union, which will make these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures need to be taken now - the old way of working of the euro will no longer exist from this date onwards.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area in which the offending countries can be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent, and in this case the private sector must bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external trade balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was led by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not understand it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will pass into more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that are offered to us by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in her own house has paved its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like anything would change.
Among the options under consideration is that we would have to leave the euro area, which is stuffed with little reputable countries, not exclude.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and evasion
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The exclusion allegedly imposed by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being shed on whether it was an unsportsmanlike act or not and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction at the next league game against Auxerre and thus enter the next stage without any cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club’s coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but adhered to rules in this sport.
Part of the debate about the case is due to the fact that a team of Real Madrid football club (who, in his anthem, claimed nobility and honor and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the lead role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added one more episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether this conduct, which is explicitly prohibited by the Statutes, does not conflict with the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts constitute a circumvention of the rules. In fact, this approach adheres to the Statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players from taking an unwarranted advantage from the opposing team.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally mean by misplaying or bypassing the rule, because circumvention of the rule was not secretly carried out to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders pulled from the deliberate fouls.
It should be pointed out here that the rival was not put in a disadvantageous position or required advantages for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without any cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, to a certain extent uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually also exit, and players will receive a sanction with this approach and move into the second card cycle, where they will exit with a card less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
It is not clear if this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices do not go against the sporting spirit, which also includes strategic decisions in order to make the most of the regulations.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a sanction (this would actually be a clear case of circumvention), they were more likely to choose when to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without evading a punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between invention and regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemic has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission.
The damage inflicted on the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer Offensive to Catch Customers for Group Christmas Dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations on the days of December 16 and 17.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners during the pre-Christmas season that supply oxygen to Barcelona’s restaurant and leisure industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the customer segment that represents the large crowd: Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner.
To make accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinners to two top guests (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to give up on this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, the lowest prices are demanded, confirms the chairman of the restaurant board of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella association does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it a hundred times before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but they pay close attention to prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service," he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices of 25 euros are the most in demand.
A survey in several centrally located restaurants found that the evening of December 17 led the providers to collapse.
The Soteras group says demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 venues, you do not lose optimism after since the second quarter the revenues are flourishing again and good, albeit focused on a few days, prospects for the Christmas business are looking forward.
Sources of the group emphasize that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 or more as a price hit. You have the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than the previous year and in return want more details, such as cava.
In some companies you can also see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are on the rise again.
On the part of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are overall quite "lively" even though the customers "make out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebrating has not declined, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises major concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons “faster than any other country.”
Wikileaks reveals the relationship between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department revealed by the internet portal WikiLeaks confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington poses.
On the edge of the clarifying and juicy details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear security is not being strengthened, but, on the contrary, is “decreasing,” and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons “to a faster rhythm than any other country.”
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack – prepare Washington for sleepless nights.
The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed the following risks in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the suspected scattering of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenal and missile programs is no longer only seen by the United States, but also by Russia as a preponderance and reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan must hire strictly religious personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; due to the low educational and cultural level, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentary unveiled by Julian Assange’s Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is waning and the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the embassy, describing communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," declared: "Frequently, there is no transparency; we do not receive answers to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another announcement, Peter Lavoy, a state intelligence official for South Asia, confirmed that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country.”
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit of the Supreme Army Chief of Staff, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clear" the person responsible that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorist leader to prevent new disclosures.
Interpol issued a red warning to prosecute and find Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated maze in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red warning” to “find and persecute” Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
It is not new, it is dated November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the recent disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
WikiLeaks founder attorney Mark Stephens said the police “know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
Already on the 20th, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the authority was received by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and locate Assange "in order to arrest and extradite him provisionally."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states, according to the organization, consider the red warning as a free letter of arrest – which must be carried out by the national police – especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be present.
Assange’s lawyers were outraged by the action, who published a letter yesterday informing them that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is ready to answer Swedish authorities’ questions by videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assange requested the exit from Sweden and received the corresponding approval from the prosecutor, who is compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin’s security.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal prosecution," the letter said.
As the world searches for him – and his mother from Australia claims the innocence of her son – Assange is in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday, he interviewed the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location, requesting the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that she was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request “sad and absurd.”
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking anti-terrorist leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to pay less attention to Assange contrasts with the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has urged the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to seize their funds and prosecute anyone who supports or contributes to them.”
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange must be “murdered.”
“Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something.”
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas, and potential presidential candidate.
“Whoever made information leak in the government is guilty of treason and anything that is not execution is too mild a penalty,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós is looking with a wink to the Carod Close Peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continuation in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the tenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the ERC after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the voters.
The party leader is aware that his resignation threat is insufficient for the close ones of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weak as its mentor himself and will not cause him the same headaches as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra is trying to win over the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the start yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could speak secretly about his stay in office.
With ballot papers, not with a raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss a ticket to the president, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he reaffirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without specifying percentages, a result “in the Bulgarian style” would not be good either.
The Carod Closest Persons demand more from the President than just to make his office available to the party, an insufficient gesture as Puigcercós controls the supreme body of Congress.
But as they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree a plan of action with the board from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation, which the leadership will submit to the Council for vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós, who, in return, is to promise to advance Congress in the autumn of 2011, which the party leadership already considers a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC considers the "polyphony" to be a detriment to stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the reigning adviser Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for various goals".
He listed five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board to represent at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally abandon the general assembly principle as a way of functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold congresses with elected delegates.
Puigcercós' team, which fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with the end of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the trembling assembly of 2008, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the general assembly principle at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This deadline is still pending, as the infogle of the internal turmoil of recent years was not advisable to tackle this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors laying in wait, the time might have come to reopen and close this matter forever.
23 murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, there were four fewer cases in México than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, four less than in the previous month, according to the census by MILENIO México.
Among the murdered are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, we have a total of 390 deaths, presumably related to organised crime.
Among the cases, one stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a town in Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearm shots, the grace shot was given to his head, and feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on Mixtecas street in the Santa Cruz Acatlán settlement of the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, the 4th, farm workers found a body with traces of torture and at least three fatal bullets in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was found a message presumably signed by the crimson organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots after leaving his home to do his job as a garbage driver.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds died as a result of bullets in the head in the settlement of San Pedro Xaloxtoc in the village of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with the gun in the forehead was found on a lonely path in the settlement of El Naranjo and under the body a cartridge shell shot down with a calibre firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewage channel of the settlement Playa Golondrina.
Emergency services searched for the remaining parts of the body, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of a body they had discovered in the area of Peña Colorada, with their hands tied backwards and their heads tied.
The man had a wound that resulted from the shot of a firearm in the neck.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men, wrapped in blankets and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza, was reported.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the remaining body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two blanket-covered dead women were discovered in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, they found the body wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket of a man who, according to the news that his murderers left beside him, was probably Mario Ríos.
In the San Francisco Acuautla settlement of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with shots of firearms in her neck.
On the woman's skin were discovered tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as chains with corresponding images.
In the last half of the month, in the municipality of Zinacantepec, next to a vehicle, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found.
Two days later, the bodies of two men, whose heads were covered with tape, and a message were discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the body was a message presumably signed by a criminal organization that said, “This happens to those who don’t participate.”
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet with traces of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the judicial centre of the settlement of San Agustín.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and tied up in black plastic bags, alongside a message, the second had been tortured and was found in a plastic bag in the streets of the settlement of Juárez.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China upholds its greenhouse gas reduction targets
China’s representative at COP16 said its country had made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and would maintain its offer to cut 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is holding its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16, assures.
At its first public appearance at the 16th UN World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and to transform its industry.
He explained that in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year that sets targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the state authorities have worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he stated, several multi-year plans have already been undertaken or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Effectiveness Programme, which was launched over the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, the government’s scientific adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts are far greater than would be generally assumed.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a 9% total contribution to environmental pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use: energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent over the last five years, and something else is expected to happen by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former panic party leader has the right to turn to the National Ordinance Commission and to demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was rightful and that the former party leader of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Ordinance Commission and demand what the right granted him.
In an interview that took place before the complaint Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espino was a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Ordinance Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right in his case to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained, it was not the time to think of 2012 and that an alliance for a presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional emerged strengthened from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal elections, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panic leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman or chairman that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would hand over the relay "to the one that the Council would appoint."
"I am very open and open, and I would be proud to give each of the Five the chairmanship of the party."
He predicted that the party's boom in the last elections on July 4 will be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would bear the flag and be observed throughout the country, which is why "many hopes and longings are put into them and I am sure Gabino is up to date with the demands."
When asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourse during his four-year government, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, should they start defending them, should they finally come out of the closet," he reaffirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government could make expressions like those he can make in his discourse at the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no mouth ban and much less a censorship.
Obama advocates the law in favor of undocumented students on Twitter
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act law, call your senators and push for the passing of that law," the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - law to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act law, call your senators and push for the passing of that law," Obama tweeted.
His brief announcement includes a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that urges the public to contact their senators, as the vote on the law is imminent.
"With your voice we're waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes in favor of any bill except for extending tax cuts from Bush’s time and extending government funding.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could impact the vote on the Dream Act law and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the blockade by Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable for the remaining projects can be set.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe we can make an agreement on this at any time and after that we can plan for the rest," he said.
The Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act law could be voted on the initiative to legalize undocumented students starting next Thursday in the Senate, though next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act—the law of the American Dream—would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were under the age of sixteen while living in that country for the last five years and enrolled in a higher education institution or army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organising an intense influence on the passing of the law.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they declared that they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who voted in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Putting your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'Die Lust an der Sprache' was a walk in which the participants made a strong commitment to the narrative
"I understand that with the sex in the language, yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los lugares de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (on another event, she explained the round table was the sex in the
The finger in the wound... “is getting us into trouble,” the Argentine writer sweetly spat at the audience, which was mainly composed of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, and Mayra Montero Luis participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and afterwards marked Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of which she has no answer, but hints for the guide.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the hallway, and who explains that wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs relieved and concludes that she "just learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist", but she is convinced that the lust for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented an adorable narrative he called 'Praise of Invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back far traveled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a turning point and told about America, the great novel that was not missing from the beginning by its own chroniclers, and he quotes Bernal Díaz del Castillo, the story of the
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with imagination that even the sense of shame was lost."
However, he emphasizes that "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things," and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the ‘Tradition Cervantes’.
"From him we inherited to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero’s turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL’s invitation to the Round Table ‘The Finger in the Wound’ had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman devoted her contribution to the great wound of social violence that is inflicting on her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unintentional commitment," she explained, after emphasizing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this dedicated writer's finger in the writer's wound".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness also result in dogmatisms, and it is forgotten that "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes."
In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means to put the finger in the wound and harass those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful who prefer to harass the world in white.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In addition, the final duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey features two different styles defined by their respective coaches, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has won the second championship with the medal, has been one step behind the winners and, surprisingly, has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santistic strategist reached the first final as coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put in a setback again, as the game ended 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the penalty he came 3-1 ahead and got two ways to put in his title, but ultimately missed three steps.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he does not want to be pursued by misfortune again and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, that's for a club, for my affection to which I surrender, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before that is the most important thing," he said.
"The only lesson we can draw from this is that until the referee whistles the end, we can't celebrate, we're prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were with two penalties, there's no preparation to exit the game, and I don't think the lesson is until there's a lesson."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootout, does not bother him, because he trusts his players to hope: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shootout, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, we were prepared in the previous tour, but unfortunately, the fate prepared us to get a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervosity, he left us in the hands.
It is in Romanso’s power to no longer be just the second champion and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring.
The U.S. Changes the Rules for Obtaining a Visa
The persons must present themselves to the consulate before their conversation at the service offices for the visa application; costs will be shortened waiting times.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the United States embassy and consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants will have to present themselves to the Visa Application Service Unit (ASC) before their interview in the consulate.
The ASC staff records the applicant’s biometric data, which is checked by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will decrease, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment, processing the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the return of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not need to have a conversation in the consulate, they only need to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
As the biometric data is obtained in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the consulate interview are left less time there than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the $26 service surcharge.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called for a press conference to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The National Aerospace Agency (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow at NASA’s headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts, a science that explores the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory find for the search for extraterrestrial life," sparking speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures could exist in hostile environments that were previously thought to be inhabitable, and it was hypothesized that they could turn into intelligent living beings - just like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it is a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, living in an environment that was thought to be too toxic for all life forms imaginable because the lake is highly arsenic-containing.
In some way, the microbiome uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere increase.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, it has been proven, according to the astrobiologists, that "there is actually a different form of life, a second form of life that is different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference the actual reach of its fund.
Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the Organ Act on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th Legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented themselves as independents, had already established itself. The four questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Before the inaugural session of the 60th Legislature began, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the Organ Law, as this would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a ‘two-party system’ would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties, who controlled Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency led by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that with these reforms, the parties PRI and PAN institutionally introduced their political marginality.
He stated that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, starting from their political will, and if they did not have it, they would again be subjugated by both parties, thus putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"Until here I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even take into account the opinions of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolistic, should now be “duopolistic”.
"It is not the spirit of legislative reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
“To begin with, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues to make them more,” the Convergencia member explained.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, referring to PAN and PRI, pointed out that the Congress has at present turned into a 'loot' for two.
"Before it was just one party, now they're splitting it into two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the MEPs and to assign them their place at the negotiating tables.
"It should not be left out on the basis of top decisions, which are likely to be nine MEPs. The five, which are currently seen as split into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed out and we do not agree with this reform."
200,000 pesos more for "the supplier"
Mazatlán City Council pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check of just over 200,000 pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city council.
This means that the sum paid to the company’s owner for electrical materials in the second half of the year is 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city government, this cheque issued for an amount of 200.144,56 pesos with the number 9258447 was issued last November 16th with the purpose of "invoicing open invoices".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent in advance that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. She is being watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to it and, as a consequence, the number of cheques still being issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing was bought from her, only the debts were paid, just like the other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two from 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last from 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is challenged by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations requesting its services, the treasurer assured that its services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published the checks issued by the municipality to its suppliers on 25 July, it was announced that previously, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also transactions with Jumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the burglary of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán applied to the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and throw a bad picture of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada dealers’ association, recalled that on various occasions it was called upon to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks had a negative impact as tourists would stroll and see the mess, turning their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to have to shut down a company one day, and they don't worry about how much money you lose, otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction work slowly and unplannedly."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community has to take its responsibility and avoid this happening again. How should it do this? Well, through preventive maintenance instead of fixing everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eager to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean habitat. The city council must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists, we need to offer a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly in the air," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents are just what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist sites of Mazatlán, because they would not be used properly and would create a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the forefront together with the city. Making the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would first have to be cleaned and cleaned in order to make them attractive to tourists and bring them to the inventory that we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
The business sector of Mazatlán is calling for a dignified parliament, free of collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and facing major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th parliament was inaugurated. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM. That is a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and the different social groups that need responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the Entrepreneurial Coordination Council CCE, suggested that the new MPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
"We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right to act free of collusion between the parties, because it is common for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus transforming them into carnival compartments of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary factions."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was Sinaloa residents who expressed their trust in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in some way will promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he asked the new MEPs to assign the necessary role in the state budget to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the ministry with the second least means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment to the country and is in direct competition with agro-industry."
Funds must be allocated to tourism projects, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which was not recast in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is sought
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family yearn for.
For the parents, it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes on the next King's Day, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and garments they so long for.
The family inhabits a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times are on the agenda because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... Even in the afternoon I go out with the girls to sell," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a 'monster car' for some time now and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothes in the size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I'd like this monster so much,' but I replied, 'let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is in size 12; ten-year-old Isaías is in size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is in size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you would like to help to realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is sought' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network, around ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, where they were said to have been used primarily for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated," Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec security police, said in a statement.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were said to have appeared in front of the Sherbrooke courthouse hours after their arrest.
They could, among other things, be accused of producing cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot, and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place for over a year.
"The information obtained from public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel explained.
About 70 police officers from the regional investigative unit Estrien of the Quebec security police, the Sherbrooke police service and the Memphrémagog police department had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could be easily persecuted
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says is supposed to regulate the problem of ships loaded with clandestine immigrants, is likely to be crushed after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter."
"I'm holding with a party that has put chains on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person to be detained for up to a year by a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian constitution of law and freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he was unable to support the bill because it was against the wrong target group.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government does,” Duceppe said.
Criticism of the immigration issue by Olivia Chow, NDP, has dismissed critics who claim her party was not steadfast enough towards the clandestine immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree that action should be taken against the blind passengers, and that is precisely what we are trying to enforce by means of another draft law, the C-35," Chow said.
We do not support the Conservative bill because it seeks the blame among the refugees and keeps children captive for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration Secretary Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians are urgently telling MPs that they will not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and treat the country like a footstool."
"They expect Canada to take tough measures," said Kenney's response.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
A conservative, however, told the QMI agency that the government would call for a vote so that every opposing MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible establishment of a new standing unit to fight corruption and collusion, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry on the subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea does not stem from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, Wednesday’s announcement has surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the least at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as "a conjured rabbit" as well as "a table-ended solution".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had addressed those who feared that political power had too much influence on the questionable future unity.
"They will see the result when we announce it," he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on wanting to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only way to be able to form an investigative committee is to resign Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and policy systems at ENA (state university for the training of high administrative officials).
In order to get out of this deadlock, he proposes that Quebec grant a special mandate to financial auditing so that it can conduct investigations into corruption and secret collusion.
"One should be able to expand the mandate of the audit control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant audit control the same power as commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This request comes from the Attorney General of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of law enforcement is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part, confirmed that his colleague from the Justice Department, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected motorcycle police groups, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal code had not been revised.
As a result, Ottawa enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several river courses remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has been pouring out in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains from 40 to 70 milliliters of precipitation have poured onto several regions.
Between 20 to 40 millimeters of further precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were the most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen here.
Since the snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to these precipitations, the violation of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alert regarding the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière, become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has resulted in the breakdown of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a bridge was torn down due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, crossing certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, according to security adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec Highwater Centre, for its part, issued warnings on Wednesday of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly corrected
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians as well as for his obscene speech on radio.
The CCNR believes that while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own opinions, certain statements "contain inaccurate information about social welfare and unjustified negative depictions of Haitians, as well as such a rude speech that is inappropriate for daytime broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion of suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two people who committed suicide violates the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasts broadcast in 2008 and 2010.
The first order was filed in response to a complaint from the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the program were inaccurate.
Rather, the moderators should provide solid and misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board considers that the questionable consequences of the broadcast 'Dupont le midi' have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not blamed for his person.
The final point of controversy was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered themselves a media-effective dispute in this regard, which had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he did not donate in favor of Haiti’s aid, since it was not certain that the needy would actually receive the money donated.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments were not abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative portrayal of the Haitians.
"I have already abolished my three-day suspension sentence in this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator explained.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of an unpolished expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, should have communicated its decisions once during the main broadcasting time within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), kickboxing and Thai boxing, is now on the lookout for new challenges on the tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
“I started martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago,” Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008, explained to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the struggle everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fighting, as it presents the mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, the security officer and employee of UPS had given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the amateur world championship held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China."
"It had been those fighters from each category who had placed themselves among the first four at the last World Cup."
"I babe got bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 I got behind in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in fifth place in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto," he added.
"It is worth noting that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating from China in which punches and footsteps as well as floor throws are allowed.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer who has emerged from this type of martial arts is the American Vietnamese originator Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal retained just one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Kung Fu Super Bowl "King of Sanda".
"This competition is the highest ranking and most respected in China," the sympathetic pound guy explained.
“It’s a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand’s largest stadium).”
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will each meet in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without call for tenders
Hydro-Québec has mutually agreed to grant $450 million in contracts to project planning firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts stands a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project manager, for a sum of $295 million without a tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a consequence of Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over its responsibility to the private sector to this important hydroelectric project amounting to $5 billion.
In early 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem, which evokes the risk of distortion of competition and an increase in prices.
“This is a new way of mapping a game and defusing the competition.”
“This means that instead of playing games in an open form instead of in a secret way,” PQ MP Sylvain Simard said in a statement.
In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this treaty was a card game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she weathered, affirming that the PQ had "proceeded unfairly" and "lacked her hardness."
She said it's "the least thing" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium model is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to bundle their expertise with regard to a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is underway and is scheduled to be completed by 2012.
Nonetheless, the contract was awarded without any competition; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is by no means an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief overflying of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of lasting duration.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Every link, and there are several dozen of them, goes back to one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
As for the Energy Gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made the nose on the fact that the contract for project management was approved by agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are few applicants, your prizes will go up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell yourself: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte reaffirmed.
This contract granted to the Consortium "Énergie Gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
According to the review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts that companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, were approved between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had obtained 22 contracts in itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these agreements have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are well known of the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had claimed that the PQ was equally connected to the companies it was "financed" before she clarified that it was rather their executives.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label is not trust-inspiring
Greener, but unmistakably skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but neither in the brands or eco-labels that should guide his choice.
Too bad, even though it is bathed in a media-efficient universe, where information is only so abundant in favor of a more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to lament, an inadequacy that is manifested as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading held yesterday showed.
Although they pushed the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec’s population admits that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as much as they do in green corporate advertising, reveals the instrument of measurement elaborately designed by the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently nurtured by only about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the void and dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another announcement, as early as 2010, more than half of consumers had changed their habits and predominantly changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their convictions.
According to barometers, they also preferred 61% purchases from retailers in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their area.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But social and ecological awareness still seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: only 28% of Quebecers reported using public transport in 2010 or preferring the carriage centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also endorsed by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the clichés.
Government Bond for the Acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was asked by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer Angus and Parallèle, who had hoped for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to acquire the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to restore it to its actual cinematic function, are apparently not getting what they demanded.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Rather, instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond at a lower level than initially hoped for, which could bring about a viable solution on beneficial terms, at least according to the sources that can be taken from the state’s rumor kitchen.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the petition has been corrected downwards since the resumption.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the file eXcentris.
Several days ago, he sent her a final report.
However, the cabinet's counter-proposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until December 31 to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have been really pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec cinema and cinema complex owners community had resisted direct government investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there that he had not sent to other cinemas as well.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, director Daniel Langlois had presented the author’s cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years with great difficulty, which could justify the exception on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele at bay.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the helm, in turn, are launching a privately funded campaign, hoping for a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not withdrawn the newspaper "Le Devoir" and ignored what he and his group think of the downwardly corrected proposals made to them.
Secret of Complex-Shaken Canada Unveiled
The new American diplomatic leadership, disseminated through WikiLeaks, unravels the secret of what the United Nations considers the Canadians to be inferior to the Americans, but at the same time reveals the latter’s sense of superiority towards Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are astonished that the Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind in the election, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were made public yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantive content one has to nibble on.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador deployed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
“A near-intrinsic complex of inferiority among Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders to talk much more about everyday internal issues than to blame the United States in this election (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the electorate has in mind as a key factor in the election."
The other expression of this sense of importance can be found in the message sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, that President Barack Obama is to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your journey will help ensure the government’s continued existence on the federal budget vote in early February, with Canada announcing its first deficit after more than a decade that has arisen as a result of a $30 to $40 billion revival program,” Breese said in a statement.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and would affect the quality of the proposed revival program.
Another message, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly-list" or even abductions for the purpose of interrogations conducted by the CIA's musculature.
Another report detailed how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to take in certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has pledged to review the file again".
Finally, let’s note that the minds are warming up regarding the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had stated via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global Plan to Renew Lighting
The United Nations has proposed a plan to renew lighting for households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) equivalent to nearly one-third of the additional reduction that needs to be realized to stabilize the Earth’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs released to the Earth due to lighting would be avoided if the white-glowing bulbs, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market today, were replaced by fluorescent or, better yet, by LEDs.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the global fleet’s exhaust emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emission companies such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt would still have to be deducted from this balance sheet in order to stabilize the climate rise by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020, in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In the white-glowing bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is twice as much reduced.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has launched this week - this company has participated in the UN study, by the way - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-glowing bulb, indicating the savings potential of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that ice completely novel bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the producers provide a receiving point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit significantly more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-glowing bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the profits that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion annually in electricity purchases and 8 million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast Expects Announcement of Election Results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" release of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential elections immediately after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a press spokesman for the UN chief.
"He calls on all parties and institutions of Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibility and abstain from any initiative until the announcement of the preliminary results."
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the Election Commission had allowed the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, to pass without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue with the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, multiple calls from all over the world have come out, the CEI may finally announce the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the resigning Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the cancellation of “fraudulent” votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (UN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had discouraged the supporters of the president from going to the polls.
The entire election could be cancelled if the actions brought by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparts are now more of the opinion that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results to be "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to claim the victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, knowing that he lost; and filing a complaint to the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of Sunday’s presidential elections were held to crown the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been split into two parts for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible in the event of an uprising.
Laurent Gbagbo had passed the first round on 31 October with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment in France remained stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable in the metropolis at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the preliminary, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is set at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and to 9.7% with the involvement of the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million French metropolitan workers were unemployed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job; this included whether they were able to work every two weeks or not, or whether they were job-seeking or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+0.9 percentage points over three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Seniors, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of those over 50 years of age, 6.6% with the involvement of overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a dispute over its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to use this method, announcing on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) versus 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), and he was transferred to the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected fraud markets.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with misappropriation of social property, misappropriation of public goods, stealing, complicitness in corruption, unlawful bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading fantasies."
"It's easy to put a number of criminal charges on him, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had emphasized the need to provide the judge with a memorandum on his justification by means of his lawyers before his hearing.
A relative of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill he had to manage running.
With regard to the business area of competence or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have known, says Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former general director of the public service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but then released under the condition of staying away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations on the facts that were accused of him."
"The chief prosecutor has considered not depriving him of his freedom," his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four other people had been charged and released from prison on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) waste disposal company, is being prosecuted for "unlawful influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Interception and misappropriation of public goods by a public official", the other on the basis of "participation in misappropriation of public funds".
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, has also been accused of "stolen and embezzled social assets".
Among the people confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been detained as a result of a similar case of public fraud affecting Corsica.
The investigators suspect his society of contributing to the laundering of money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the disposal sector, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation proceedings.
It is apparent from close investigation sources that the investigation focuses particularly on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediator role for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "spying," held the French public in breath, put diplomacy on alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the Le Monde newspaper reveal some backgrounds to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not result in the release of Majid Kakavand, a Iranian imprisoned in France and sought by the American judiciary because of trade in material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media in order to make it credible the idea that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss into a glaring light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage-takes".
François Richier, an Elysée consultant on strategic issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, and talked to American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised the Americans to do everything they could to bring back their own nationals who were being forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulate loudly and clearly and without interruption" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do that."
Because "silence does not solve anything", past the discussions about inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a “common Iranian tactic”: “hostage for the purpose of political blackmail.”
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should come about on August 16, the day she flees to the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he lets it be said that the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will exacerbate itself."
The Iranians could "arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but remains detained in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding due to illegal trade in sensitive electronics material to Iran, has been released from prison by a judge in Paris.
The American embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of another interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidium and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr. Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, reconnects, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings headed by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make, through statements and media-organized "escape attempts," Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad play a "important" and "influenced mediator role."
Americans do not observe this activity without irony, noting that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 summons up "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is so much “thank you” to Mr. Assad based on, the Paris embassy wonders.
"Despite their statements full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to abandon this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyzed.
A policy launched in 2008 was then "perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"Edifying the Syrian role" Paris "tries to show Syria what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
It also aims to “seed disagreement between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them for everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is passing a law called “the Ashtray”, which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them from access, government officials indicated.
A bill calling for online gaming operators to deny access to these games to young people under the age of 16 after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family Affairs described.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning in school and also living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the draft ministerial representative of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturers would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to reduce the time limit granted daily for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the controller added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report various events associated with intense internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
In light excitement due to suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which squabbling for influence and lobbying threatens to push technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of delegation figures (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets the measure of economic and political commitment to a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA’s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be as important to the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations by bringing about the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, namely in 1966.
The BBC had once again given it ground on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that takes three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire.
Reason enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who had been lobbying intensely with David Cameron in the last few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a re-release of the chess move by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to re-value the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stages, hotels, transport), has become a major outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the unwavering insinuation of the accusations made by the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of committee members.
"You throw them dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s long-awaited approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which makes Asian opportunities for 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar having pulled all the records with the anticipation of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion toward new territories, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights acquitted by European countries (due to the time shift), the delicate nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: the openness
De Gaulle really did.
Mitterrand had made him think he was stooping.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not good to face on the side of the mystery attached to the presidency function.
So you have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
In one sense, as well as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate could not be ruled out without even believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that on Tuesday evening he would make the perspective of "two mandates" ring in front of the UMP parliamentarians in the Elysée had thus spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far missing.
The president simply pointed out that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years left with me at worst, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next phase."
His words from the day before make him no more a candidate than he did the day before, but no less.
If you make a comment, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS are admonishing to fight earlier than assumed.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% vs. 44%, according to the BVA-L’Express poll).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," the prime minister's environment responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has accepted the openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Board last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the order for a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to come to a close at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt to undoubtedly not afford to deal with even today's more than tense situation in the European bond markets, so as not to cause their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
France’s finance minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB’s active role in resolving Europe’s public debt at a press conference yesterday.
She has not dared to say whether she believes that the central bank can do even more, for example by boosting its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not been very eloquent about his plans the day before in Brussels at the hearing of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, but rather was content to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities in the secondary market would "continue" and that at the meeting on Thursday we will "see" the decision.
Only certainty: the ECB will remain at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury’s bond purchases were doubled by the ECB last week to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among traders, the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price is by no means doubted (see page 29).
Economists do not expect any significant change of course anymore.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will still be able to make up for the unrestricted cash reserves in a free manner, over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already preparing for this measure to be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a purchase volume of bonds that stimulates the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the eurozone sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must step up to the position of the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the rush of enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest countries," a key bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates start to rise, the states would be prevented even more from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
Berlusconi's government is hiding in Italy
After a troubling start to the week for Italy, the situation has been somewhat relaxed yesterday with the fall of the basic interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, Regional President Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and had heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person concerned immediately denied.
On Tuesday, the scissors with the German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, causing a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed his "severe concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible threat of infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated dwindling tax receipts, which put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget available to the Senate for scrutiny is expected to be 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission estimates that the budget deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% forecast by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the riot about a new household collective, which could be deployed after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF, said in a statement.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.), is called for less stabilization progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question remains of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections could be organised as early as the end of March.
So there is a very unfavourable period ahead for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said in a press conference in Paris: "I think they have proved it on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: the Europeans are clearly together, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency territory."
Although quite relative - the deduction recorded yesterday on the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of the governments as well as the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to talk about a beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could downplay Portugal's debt note, arguably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly burdensome on the banking systems," said the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time passes much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, who are well aware of both this gap and the danger that it entails, are intensifying discussions to reinforce the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly affected and in a broader sense with their counterparts of the G20 are progressing well.
And this also with a view to the meetings of Eurogroupe and ECOFIN at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the plan is the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the backs of the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As for the EU Stability Funds, its executive director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the ground for this.
The EU Stability Fund’s first paper spending is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative had entrusted the agency to Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilized by the IMF’s additional, direct engagement.
In turn, Portugal and Spain, the first-line countries, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, in particular in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to the austerity measures, but should have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than did Greece and Ireland.
Both the one and the other are concerned at all costs with avoiding having to ask for international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding on inevitable structural reforms that will bring them back trust in the long run.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on November 24, had been the first to come up with the idea that if the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to grab its own pocket again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a key player in the European public debt market, judge that an extension of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means exists: the European mechanism of doped financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
An advisory board that has every opportunity to be examined attentively in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are straining.
Snow and Glatteis: 24 departments in alarm level Orange
The snow incidents continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on Orange alert due to the threat of snow and ice.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne regions have been added to the 20 departments already on alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers touch the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers of 2 to 5 cm, in places also of 7 to 10 cm, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm, are expected in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are significant enough to cause traffic constraints and interfere with certain economic activities, Meteo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardie, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "invites drivers to take the utmost care on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) on Thursday called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Roissy Airport in Paris and 10% of flights departing from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in south London and Edinburgh, Scotland, will be closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, remember the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the start of construction of the SGP, the state has issued a capital dotation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then enable the SGP to lend part of the financial sum to the markets at its double.
Finally, the first calculations have been made today.
The supplementary budget of 2010, reviewed this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on development and a higher taxation of offices on Ile-de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the bill, goes "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
“The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year.”
The second is a reorganization of the already existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not figured in the text.
Of the four billion, it is far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of capital entitlement raised by the state and provided gradually to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement reads.
The SGP does not find this system offensive.
"Since the moment when revenues are recorded (the two taxes, i.e.), one can cover the planning for more than three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 billion promised will be sought for a long time, runs the risk of provoking a quite moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and busy spies
WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, giving a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let us proceed in sequence.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (an X-nation) is composed solely of newspaper clippings.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits are nothing more than what you’ve been reading in every x-any journal for months anyway (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifyingly caricatured profile of Gaddafi has been offering her cabaret artists for a long time.
The rule that secret dossiers may consist only of already known news is essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rose-Cross) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (or because he does not know where news about the non-existent would be found), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Also the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, an editor at Libération), who only considers true what he recognizes.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi sent by the US embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as that published by Newsweek the week before.
So why was such a nuisance made about the disclosures of these dossiers?
On one side, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II and since then the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into espionage centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that one does so by ignoring it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-any hacker can tap into the most secrets of the most powerful country in the world holds a significant blow to the prestige of the state department.
In addition, the scandal puts the victims in distress less than the "arrestors".
But let us dedicate ourselves to the profound nature of what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell’s time, one could bundle all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have since proved perfectly correct, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
But if one considers what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – chosen as the avenger of the citizen – can uncover the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret, since it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty means stealing any power.
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this insult that has been inflicted on such a mighty power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer put any reserved information online – that would be like a sticker on the street corner.
But it’s equally obvious that with current technologies, it’s in vain to hope to keep confidential reports secret over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state has moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
In the future, how could private relationships be maintained only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and novel, but I see myself compelled to imagine the government agents secretly moving busy on uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages with them nowhere but in mere memory, and beyond that the few written information they have got in the set.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, Watergate’s espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer nowadays, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet is reconstructing a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band by band by being able to rewind from back to front and unravel all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while it takes three and a half hours by plane including the transfer.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to come back to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks out for its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the fast-resolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or early funding) that have been realised by developing countries.
And already the rough French beautiful shipyards have been uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years, while France has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU drew all the registers to convince its partners of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed progress report of their Member States, press conference, major side events, distribution of brochures.
The Transparency Operation is remarkable and just appreciated for its true value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track to respecting its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort was made without sacrificing public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline they consider best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen as a benchmark for that of 2009: international funding will be retained, and will add 150 million to the "fast-start" funding for more than three years.
Other countries have chosen similar targets, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France considered the funding of "all new projects" of 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks on previous year’s expenditure or on the global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France pretends to comply with its commitment regarding "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about it yet, and everyone chooses their computing mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> as equivalent to 1 donated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Obviously, this is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments can be justified (often tied to emissions mitigation projects based on the most effective technology), it is deceptive to present the euro taken as the equivalent of a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the investor country should be counted as the interest rate.
But France has nothing but the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% (36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) make 100% of their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to fulfil its obligations, France only spends 10 cents and that means a comparable effort.
Lovely hocus pocus!
All in all, France, in its fast-start financing, operates with a double fraud: partly with the development of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial deployment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Treasury (since it seems Bercy was the one who conducted the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once inside the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn the lesson from this first year of early financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could advance the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently discussed topic): one does not escape the question of "accountability" or the accounting method of its loans.
France could change its position to be just as progressive in terms of disputes as it is in other matters.
So hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement of France’s fast-start and its vision of “accountability” as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child consumes 81 different chemical substances over the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its findings "do not represent a statistically significant value given the small number of samples analysed, but rather an illustrative character of the treated problem," had bought the food usually consumed within four, from a approximately ten-year-old child at mealtimes, plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris, between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - were examined as well as lab snacking in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or likely to be carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrinine interference factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually ingested substance are not exceeded in the near totality of the cases, this survey takes very good account of the fact that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrinine disruptors is worrying," the association notes.
Already at breakfast, the butter and tea with milk alone already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of a strictly banned insecticide in the EU.
Furthermore, the hack steak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and the chewing gum were spiked by pesticides and other chemicals.
In the case of tap water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the “richest” with 34 identified chemical residues, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is likely to be underestimated," the study said.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "growth of civilizational diseases" in view of the urgency of the situation.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had identified the presence of residues related to 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
