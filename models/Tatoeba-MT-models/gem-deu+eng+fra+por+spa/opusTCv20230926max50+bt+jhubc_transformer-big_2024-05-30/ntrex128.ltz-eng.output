Welsh deputies are worried about looking like idiots.
There are several members of the House of Representatives who have proposed that their title be changed to a member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was created in order to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
People across the political spectrum are concerned about being ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party was concerned that it would rhyme with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means dom and pwp kaka.
A deputy of the Plaid party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was open about changing the name, but indicated that MWP and Muppet would not lie far from one another.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced the same as the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The committee of the Assembly, which is currently developing laws to introduce the change of name, said: "The decision on the appointment of the deputies, of course, lies with the deputies themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission released the results of a public meeting on the proposal, which received much support.
The Commission favoured "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMPs," but the MWP option received more support in a public meeting on the question of the title of the deputies.
The MPs apparently suggested other options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could cause headaches to the chairman of the board, Elin Jones, who is expected to enter the bill of amendments within two weeks.
The legislation on reforms includes other amendments, such as the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of deputies and the draft committee system.
The last word on the question, as they should be called, when discussing the legislation.
Macedonians are elected for the referendum on the change of the country's name.
The voters will vote on Sunday whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up in a proposal to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province, which is Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the vote on the change of name, said he did not want to ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is the price to be paid to join the EU in NATO.
The sounds of St. Martin's Church are as quiet as the sounds of the Church during the Harlem Battle
"Once upon a time, the old men said that there was a cafe and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"There's nothing left today."
He said that the coffee shop was a good idea.
"People are socializing," he said.
"They don't want to be in a place where people are going."
As for the "churches," he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as those responsible imagine, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with property dwellings and filled with people who do not help the remaining protected areas in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings are white," he said, "and therefore want to close these churches quickly, because it is unlikely that most of these people will become members of this church.
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black capital – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist community was moved in the 1930s.
A black community from not far away took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a main street for trade in Harlem who did not want to hire blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when the members of Father Johnson's community made plans for the reconstruction, they ordered the glazing.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's boss and successor of St. Martin's, proudly called the game "The Clack of the Poor."
The expert who played the piano game in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument"
The expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also found that it was the world's first clown play played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger clown play at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What took place in St. Martin in the last few months was a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were introduced by the lay leaders, others by the bishopric.
In July, the Sacrifice – its governing body, with lay officials – wrote to the diocese, worrying that the diocese “would try to pass on the cost to the sacrifice”, although the Sacrifice did not write in place of the architects and entrepreneurs.
Some pastors have complained about a lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai injured 13-year-old in lobster diving in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving near lobster in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m., not far from Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was a Saturday morning with friends at dusk for half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help and you paddled over with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
In the beginning, he said, "It's just the joy of catching a lobster, but then he realized that he was yelling 'I was bashed!'"
I'm going to be cheated!"
"He's got the whole thing broken up," said the boy, as he approached his son.
"I told everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was transferred to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was placed in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
SpongeBob Capt. Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen a few weeks earlier, but this was considered a non-dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victims suffered traumatic injuries in the body.
The officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casabland to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security purposes.
Giles stressed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, most of which are considered non-dangerous.
Sainsbury's climbs into the beauty market of Great Britain.
Sainsbury's picks up boots, superdrug and Debenhams, with departments of beauty in the department store style with specialized assistants.
As part of a substantial <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion promotion in the UK beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and homewear return, these larger beauty departments will operate in 11 stores across the country, and next year in further stores if successful.
The supermarkets are investing in beauty because they want to fill the shelves that were otherwise reserved for the displays, microwaves and other home furnishings.
Sainsbury's said they would be the size of its beauty offering up to 3,000 products including for the first time with brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The assortments of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, which are already up-to-date, will also gain more space with exclusive brand areas, similar to those in the boots stores.
The supermarket is also launching its boutique make-up range again, so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by young consumers.
Perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, with the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Buying online in small amounts of daily groceries and small stores means that supermarkets need to make more efforts to ensure that people get to them.
Mike Coupe, the manager of Sainsbury's, said the outlets were increasingly looking like department stores, as the supermarket chain was trying to fight more services and non-food products against the discounters Aldi and Lidl.
ainsbury' has opened Argos Oulets and hundreds of aftermarkets and has also purchased several habitats stores since the supermarket both chain two years ago. This has strengthened the sales of the food and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to overhaul the cosmetics and pharmacy department failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the cooperation was soon over, after a dispute over the sharing of the drugstore's revenues in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 drugs to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy Chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Llodys will play a role in the plan by launching an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the look and feel of our beauty areas to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can love to ask the customer for advice.
Our range of brands is tailored to every need. Through a friendly environment and advantageous locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that puts the old ways of shopping in jeopardy."
Peter Jones "swallows" about a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal, by Holly Willoughby.
Peter Jones, the star from Dragons Den, has become "swift" after television presenter Holly Willoughby signed a contract of over <0xC2><0xA3>11 million with their lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The company's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop.
The presenter of This Morning, 37 years old, announced on her Instagram account that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby pushed Peter Jones, the star from Dragons Den, out of her lucrative Lifetsyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new contracts Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "silent" as the TV star during a relaxed meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer had time for her homewear and accessories brand.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop and doubled Willpughby's estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones fled the UK and went to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “Truly was far from Holly’s main priority.
It would have been their long-term future, which would have accompanied them through the next century.
The decision to leave the house surprised all the people.
No one could believe what was going on at the beginning.
At the headquarters in Marlow, there is a warehouse with goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that leaving the This-Morning moderator, who is one of the bankable stars from Great Britain, could cost the company millions, as they invest in many products, from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and there are now potentially again delays for the launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby brought Truly to the bee with the 2016 Capp, and Jones, 52, rose to power as president in March.
Jones is 40 percent behind Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as the presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source with information about Jones said last night "We're not going to comment on his business affairs."
We swore, and then we fell in love.
He made the joke about the criticism he would receive from the media because of a comment some people would consider "non-presidential," and because he is so positive about the North Korean president.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "television moderator's voice."
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, the negotiations on denuclearization do not take place.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leading politician during the UN General Assembly a Saturday that the North saw no "compliant response" from the US to North Korea's earlier disarmament steps.
The U.S. will continue to push sanctions to continue.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"I'm a North Korean boy," he said.
"I went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results - no more missile tests, help to free hostages, and the repatriation of American soldiers who fell in battle from mortal overcrowded missile tests.
And he defended his unusual way of talking about relationships with Kim.
It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we would only have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the people directly in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreigners were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been delocalized, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is a challenge," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet safe to work on foreign personnel on site.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Protection Administration, said Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can participate in the relief measure.
With regard to the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country unfortunately does not remain sufficiently prepared for the will of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not found anywhere on the coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning serial in Palu, although there was a warning, probably cost a lot of lives.
Traveling between the various Indonesian islands is often a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship, which was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims, sets out on its way to Palu, but needs at least three days to reach the site of the new accident.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the main theme of his election campaign and donated money to the streets and railways.
But Mr. Joko's reign was also plagued by a lack of funding, where he re-established himself next year.
Mr. Joko is also exposed to the pressure of partisan tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority represent a more conservative form of belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought with knives, bees and files and other brutal weapons on the streets.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge compares the game to a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with a gold in the 89th minute a Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London against a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters ahead of Chelsea's Goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He picked up the ball with his left foot and shot in the direction of gold.
The attempt is high above the box, in the right corner of the net.
The ball flew over a jumping arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"It was only a matter of getting into this position, getting the ball and players like Shaq always playing as much as possible ahead, so I tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge said on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the edge and touched it once, and didn't think about it and just shot."
Chelsea were 1-0 after the break ahead by a gol in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues stormer made a pass back to Mateo Kovacic in this game before sprinting halfway to Liverpool.
Kovavic made a quick double pass in the midfield.
He then shot through a beautiful ball that sent the hazard and the box.
Hazard runs past the defense and ends up in a long pot with a left-footed shot around Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 a.m. a Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is 832.
The death toll in Indonesia due to the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, as the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
According to the spokesman of the agency, Lord Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, many people were stranded in the rubble of buildings, which destroyed a peace by the earthquake of a strength of 7.5, and caused waves of up to 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with dust from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman to death.
An investigation into murder was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds at Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
People from the area who have seen or heard anything should report to the police.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagen said: "The investigation is still in its initial stages, but anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead should contact us.
I would also like any other person, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded something on Dashcam footage to contact us, because they may have information that may be important to our surveys."
A police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a house.
These afternoons, friends who think to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about where she was found.
The police continue to investigate and inform other family members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews now just wanted to go back to his home, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building at the moment.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
They say it's going to take a while before they get back home.
It was reported that a police officer told a man that the whole area is currently being considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
They always say, "It's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars stood inside the closure and another outside the closure.
A number of police officers were standing inside the lockdown and were monitoring the residential quarters.
Anyone who has any information should contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymous Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 Protocol 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament is the new memorial stone, which is concerned with the series "Rewriting History."
His connection would be a poetic justification for the destruction of so many cultural and religious artefacts in England by the fanatics and Puritan followers of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society describes Lord Crick's suggestion as "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldmsith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure on Oliver Cromwell was targeted in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The symbol of the British Civil War was ordered by Cromwell and was not executed.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been offered for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hama Thorneycroft's great representation of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure, many of whom still crowd that it is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell has been regarded by many, perhaps first in the late 19th century as today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the 'monarchy.
Whether or not it's an accurate representation is still an issue.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of commemoration and remembrance.
The pig is a farmer's
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, who was only identified by his surname "Yuan," was dead with a severed artery near a stable found on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported a Sunday.
A swine herder is preparing to inject swine vaccines into a hoofyard on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he was travelling with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered an open door to a nearby swamp.
He said that there was a large male pig in the stall with blood on its tail.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that dat 550 pounds of heavy swine crushed the farmer to death, according to reporters.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and tied," as the cousin was nicknamed "Wu," as Guiyang Evening News quotes.
The pictures of surveillance cameras show the Yuan Thursday morning going to the market at 4:40 to feed the pigs.
His body is an hour later.
The animal that killed the man is not a swine of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people while the police were gathering evidence on the spot.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are presumably negotiating decisions for his death.
Even though they were still alive, they had been attacked by swine.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts. The man was severely injured.
In 2006, a <0xC2><0xA3>650 heavy pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to chase the animal.
After a farmer was frozen of his pig in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They're just playing.
They just want you to know, they don't want you to.
You just have to show respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa in the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the killing waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, the pink floods will bring with them in the north of Mexico and in the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
The rose had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane since 5:00 a.m. east time a Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugeni, in Mexico.
It is expected that the rose will move to the north.
Meanwhile, a canal is about to form over the Pacific Ocean, and moves towards the west coast of the United States, and the pink one May be closer and closer to the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical star, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture from the north and southwest U.S.
The rose will bring a girl up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture, which interacts with the nearer approaching channel, will form widely distributed heavy locks in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain causes dangerous hazards, mud flow and possible earth drought in the desert.
Theft tropical moisture causes claws of 2 to 3 inches per hour in several locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 zantimeters of rain are expected in parts in the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
Floods are possible, with weather conditions becoming increasingly worse due to the destructive nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely light-sensitive to walk in the desert with the risk of tropical locks.
Thick rain can cause canyons that quickly turn into rivers and thunderstorms will bring locally rough air and dust with them.
The nearer approaching canal will bring thick local rains to the parts of the southern California coast.
Closures of over half an inch are possible, which can lead to small sludge flow and smooth roads.
This would be the first time in the season.
Some distributed tropical travel routes are starting to get closer to Arizona, late Sundays and early Mondays, before the rain continues to spread, late Mondays and evenings.
It's going to be the four corners of the four corners and the four corners of the four corners of the four corners.
In October, there may be some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature fluctuations is a sunshine in the center of the United States.
There is almost a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the sun will be shining and shining.
In many central and eastern United States, a hot start is expected in October with widespread 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northwest.
New York City was able to reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast will provide high chances for excess temperatures for the east of the United States by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people watched a thunderstorm of the Supreme Court statement by Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that was supposed to happen in the 1980s, on six television channels.
Meanwhile, the political mess continues, and broadcasters have interrupted the regular broadcasts for the last-minute twist of a Friday: an agreement that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake joined with the FBI to conduct investigations during a week of charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had fully touched her and was trying to take her out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a pathetic statement, said he was 100% sure that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people have watched the process.
The company has an average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numerous other networks that transmitted the process, including PBS, C-Span, and Fox Business Network were not directly available.
In Nielsen, there are often a few difficulties involving people looking at offices.
To illustrate the whole thing: the number of spectators is equal to that of a playoff football match or the Oscars crossover.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Interest remains high in the process.
Flake was the central character in the drama of Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was kindly urged the morning of demonstrations while attempting an elevator for a trial on the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with low-pitched eyes while being cheated and was live on CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?
He said, "You have power, while so many women have no power."
Flake said that his office had given a position before the lift closed and that he should have said more after the hearing of the committee.
The cable and broadcasting networks later reported live hours before the Judiciary Committee should vote to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said he will only do this with the understanding that the FBI's appeals against the nominees for next week are investigating what the Democrats' minority wanted.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a few senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the choice to vote for Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh.
Britain’s Prime Minister May has accused critics of “playing politics” about Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of abandoning their plans to “play politics” with Britain’s future and weaken national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, in addition to her on the title page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson underlined her attack on her so-called Chequers plot for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should raise their taxes on each other would be "very ridiculous."
Wayde-Sims shooting: The police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player.
The police arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The officials released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and the Simpsons and the police said the Sims had lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA there, CBS partner WAFB reported.
After Simpson was owned, the police said he had admitted to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The office of East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner released a provisional report on Friday, where it is said that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department honors the refugee officers of the Louisian State Police, the State Poice Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and residents from the area for help in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flesh and the search for justice."
The Sims were 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
A Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach said his team was "destroyed" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
"That's what it's all about," Wade said.
Volcano spits ashes on Mexico City
The spicy ash of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern neighbors of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it became active in the crater, and recorded 183 gas and ash discharges in the last 24 hours.
The center has recorded a few thunderstorms and biases.
Images on social networks show thin layers of ash on the cars in neighboring Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted a rise in volcanic activity that has shaken 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-strong earthquake hit Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflict with Catalan separtisans before the anniversary of the independence elections.
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters disagreed with the police, and as thousands participated in rival demonstrations for the first anniversary of the Catalan polarizing election for the separation.
A group of masked pro-separists were held back in riots against the police with eggs and powder paint, which formed dark clouds in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, the police took out their knuckles to check on the fighters.
Over the past few hours, pro-independence groups have called out "No Forgiveness, No Forgiveness" against Unionists who have called out "Long Live Spain."
Fourteen people have been hospitalized for injuries in the protests, the local press reports.
Tensions remain high in the independence region one year after the October 1 referendum, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separtisans.
Voters voted majority to become independent, but the result was low against the separation by the boycott of the election.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the elections in the electoral offices across the region from violent conflicts.
Pro-independence groups camped outside overnight to prevent a demonstration on the support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, says he no longer has any hopes regarding the prospect of an independent Catalan.
“Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy because they could choose to go, but now I'm stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive, albeit scarce victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties had a hard time this year to remain in suspense.Most of the most famous leaders were in exile or imprisonment and have waited for their role in organizing the referendum and later independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protests on the phone as support for the police, said the conflict was heated by politicians from the two sides.
"It's becoming more and more difficult," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in the Preventive Prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would participate in the European elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression and democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Runs at Home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car repeatedly ran into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Insp Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point a gunshot wound was shot at the car.
Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers by Menga's gold.
Dolly Menga's first gold medal won.
Steven Gerrard's only second victory in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's storm proved the difference when Gary Holt switched sides with Hibernian in second half.
Gerrard's side will not be eligible to win in the Premiership this season and play against the Leaders Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points ahead of them.
Previously, Rapid Vienna won the Europa League in a thunderstorm.
Livingston, meanwhile, is extending his run in the division to six players, with coach Holt still scoring the victory since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston faces up to the odds against the upbeat visitors.
His team should have had the nues for long before the hit, because their directness caused the ranger's problems.
Scott Robinson has penetrated but carried his effort to the gold, then Alan Lithgow could only aim his effort before he hit Craig Halkett before the gold.
The hosts were pleased to let the rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause misery among the visitors.
And that's how the gold fell.
The Rangers were given a free kick in Livingston, combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to play Menga, who once touched and hit the center of the box.
At the time, the rangers dominated the property but found the home defense impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly quiet.
The pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a parade of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied off the feet of Rangers Golkip Allen McGregor and Lithgow shot wide of yet another draw from Livingston.
Crossers always came back to Livingston's box and were always rounded, while two 11-yards were demanded - after Halkett challenged Glenn Middleton's replacement, and one for handball - were waived.
"Wonderful" by Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to surpass the expectations in this high way.
Their style of play and staff has hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but great credit has had to go to the hole for the way he has refreshed the team since his arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was a huge, super organized defense leader, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall through to their seventies.
Ned had a lot of inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they fell short of the standards.
The last pass was missed – just as they opened the home page – and it was something like a wake-up call for the rangers who settled in the midfield.
Erdogan received a special reception in Cologne.
There were laughter in the blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the chief of Turkey and Germany were watching to drink coffee in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – which was planned to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have talked about issues including human rights, press freedom in Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan has set out on his way to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police have taken security measures to block a strong crowd of 25,000 people from their assembly in front of the mosque, but many supporters have appeared to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – have also heard their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Everywhere protesters reflect the divisions of a visitor who is greeted as a hero by several German Turks and as a monarch of others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies in collision with a car.
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred not far from the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southwest of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the rescue assistants helped, but the man died on the pitch.
The crash occurred months after a cyclist died in a driver's escape on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
The police said the officers were trying to identify the man and inform the family.
Road closures and bus deflections are on the street and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Discipline
Six prisoners were injured in an unordered and a high-security prison for men, the prison officer said.
Unorderment broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST a Sunday and it continues.
Specialist "Tornado" officers were ordered to take care of the order, which involved eight prisoners in a wing.
The officers were placed on the spot for small miracles in the face.
A press statement from the prison said: Specially trained prison personnel were hired to take care of the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members were treated for bliss.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the responsibility of the police could be expelled and spent longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous perpetrators in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
Last October, police officers were called to jail to take care of a serious inconvenience and the personnel were attacked with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa dries Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas can benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week as Hurricane Rosa sinks last energy down through the southwestern desert and brings flood risks.
National droughts have already caused flooding for months and decades for western Arizona heading south and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct way across Phoenix to the dens and come closer later with rain.
The National Remembrance of Phoenix wrote in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones could maintain the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest national hurricane center models predict 2 to 4 zantimeters of rain, with isolated numbers up to 6 zantimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, can receive 1 to 2 zantimeters, with isolated numbers up to 4 zantimeters.
For those without flood risks, the rain is a blessing because the region is affected by a drought.
Although the floods are a very serious concern, a little bit of rain will probably be good because in the southwest there are dry conditions at the moment.
The United States, after just over 40 percent of Arizona, experiences at least an extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com said.
First, Hurricane Rosa is heading for the country across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane force a Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm drove to more cold water in the Pacific and therefore lost strength.
So, it is expected to row land in Mexico with tropical storms strengthening on Monday in the afternoon or evening.
Rain over parts of Mexico could be difficult, putting a significant flood risk.
"Precipitation from 3 to 6 zantimeters is expected from Baja California and northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 zantimeters possible," weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border and early morning morning on Tuesday as a tropical depression, where she will then move up through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its survivors is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the United States' southwestern desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that this rain will produce life-threatening floods and mud flows in the desert, and landfills in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attacked four suspected murders
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for presumed murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The youth was found injured in the area of the Excelsior terraces in Midsomer Norton, around 4 a.m. a Saturday.
When he was brought to the hospital, his health condition was stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and at least 20-year-old man was arrested at night near Radstock, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police have called to witnesses who may have picked up something on the phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh is suffering from the anger of the Democratic Party.
"The election of Judge Kavanaugh as an election against the reckless and empirical tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at an election party in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered through the whole recklessness and anger of the Democratic Party throughout the election process.
Kavanaugh vehemently and emotionally dismissed Christine Blasey Ford's allegations before Congress that he had sexually harassed her when she was still a teenager.
Ford has also sworn that it is true.
The president said a Samsden that "the American people saw the splendor and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh to confirm as a voice for one of the best lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a confirmed number of deaths for the public.
Kavanaugh's nomination was noted by the president during his speech on the importance of Republican electoral participation in half of the term.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
"I'm not running, I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I've been fighting all over the place for great candidates."
Trump argued that he was on a mission to "become and slow down."
The first decisive election at Senate level for Kavanaugh's nomination should already take place on Friday, a senior math worker told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number continues to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many have been swept away as huge waves hit the coast, as a major earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities at Samsden said.
Hundreds of people attended a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday as 6-metre-high waves struck across the coast in the dark, many of which ripped to death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami became threatening yesterday, people were still on the beach tracking their activities and were not immediately running away," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesian disaster protection, said in a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it was full of cars, huts, Hziser, and everything on land was ripped away," Nugroho said, noting that the tsunami had hit the sea at 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Some people have climbed trees to escape the tsunami and have survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people have been evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs made public by disaster protection show many buildings and buttresses that have been destroyed, bridges that have been ripped away and collapsed into a mosque that surrounds all of the water.
The Samsden were swept away by the coastal town.
Earthquakes have been reported in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology said in a communiqué that the energy released during the earthquake of its peace had the power of 200 times the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical situation of the city at the end of a long stretch of bay may have further intensified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho has described the shoe as "extreme" and so that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have been destroyed.
Corpses were found under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, plus 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the injuries and damage could be great on the 300km long coast north of Palu, in a area called di Doggola, and is close to the epicenter.
The communication "as completely collapsed and we are without information" of Donggola, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a communiqué, and their staff and volunteers are invaded the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, it's a tragedy, it's a tragedy," he said.
The agency as his Samsden has been fervently criticized because they haven't been able to see that his tsunami hit Palu, officials said the waves came out at the same time as the warning.
Amateur images on social media point to a man on a higher stack who is alerted by calls from those on the bottom of the road before the tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall hits the coast, and builds buildings and cars mat.
Reuters was only able to confirm the images.
The quakes and tsunami caused its massive power outage and the communication around Palu paralyzed waters made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has first shipped transport aircraft with aid from Jakarta and other cities, as well as the authorities, but those evacuated still urgently need food and things for the most important needs.
The local airport was just opened for rescue teams and will remain tracked until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800.
It's like a scam.
While the staff of World Vision of Donggola safely arrived in Palu City as where the employees were interrupted and camped on the grounds of their office, seven scenes of destruction had to be inflicted on each other, according to Lord Doseba.
"I've been told that there are a lot of people who have lost their homes," he said.
It's like a scam.
As the relief teams began to recognize the extent of the destruction, some complained that foreign relief teams with great experience were only allowed to gain access to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, material and personnel may only be allowed to enter the country if the affected area is declared as a national disaster area.
But it's just going to happen.
"As always, it's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'Okay, it's like a national disaster,' we can open up to international aid but date as yet to happen."
As the second night in Palu comes after the earthquake and tsunami of its peace, friends and families hope that here missing belongs to those miracles that always appear after such disasters.
In the same way, it's like a small gin rescued from a channel.
On a Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who was buried under a heap of rubble, right next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders who were shot to death for the Asian players.
Others from the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, as well as the Lord's Monday.
"When I was in a parachute, I had to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon just like him, in the hours after the news where the rumors of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel and the paragliding group went around, sent WhatsApp news to the teams that participated in the Beach Festival.
Sadly, it was only one of the two squads, and only one of the two squads.
"I'm not saying that it's just that the news is being delivered," he said.
Robbers robbed $26,750 while filling a vending machine in Newport /Levee.
The robbers happily denounced a Brink's security guard who was about to fill his Bancomat, stolen $26,750 in Newport/Levee, according to a Newport police letter.
The driver was about to empty the Bancomat into an entertainment complex and was just about to pay off the money, policeman Dennis McCarthy wrote.
While he was busy, another man "came from behind Brink's employee" and stolen his money case that was just to be delivered.
There are more suspects who have fled the scene, but the police did not know how much it would have been.
Anyone with any information about the identity should contact the police of Newport at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He tweeted, "It's officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has since been called Ye and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The album will be released on Saturday Night Live, where the release of the new album will be announced.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande di for "emotional reasons" can't be on the show, according to the show's founder.
Even though it's an abbreviation to his professional name, the West has previously said that the word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said at a presentation of his new album on Radio Big Boy earlier this year.
"So I am you, I am the sea, I am the sea."
It comes from Kanye, dat means the one, to only yes - the mirror of our good, our evil, our perseverance, everything.
The album is the reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous rappers who change his name here.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has decided on Love and Brother Love.
A former mat singer from the West, the JAY-Z, has always played with small and large letters.
The U.S. government has sworn to oppose civilians
In the run-up to the 50-year celebrations of the bloody arrest of students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn never to attack the military against the civilians.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to "never use the military too much to suppress the Mexican Volcano."
During a peaceful demonstration at the Plaza on October 2, 1968, the troops shot at the people and killed 300 at a time when the left-handed back went through Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has announced that young Mexicans will be supported by monthly subsidies to students and by the opening of more free universities.
He had said that the labour and the failures of school averages promoted criminal ties.
The U.S. would have doubled the funding of the K.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the sum in research in the field of artificial intelligence, says the investor and friends of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after hearing more and more from circles of the U.S. government that the U.S. does not have a proper strategy in research on AI.
Meanwhile, China has presented its latest plan for years: the first in the research of AI is by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget of artificial intelligence as a good start, considering that all other nations are so far behind the United States, and we are working towards the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next leap will be measured in the United States, Lee CNN said in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" came out this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, as director general at Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most well-known AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, later he was director general at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
Lee knew about the previous technology competitions in the United States as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when they would be next to help find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state aid, such as Lee.
"It's only China that is taking the academy to the top; it's the societies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have engaged the luminaires and the latest years of the universities to work on AI.
As a result, Lee's immigration law could also be improved in the U.S. to enforce AI research.
"I think the green card should be automatically offered to professors in AI, as soon as he.
The Chinese government announced its next-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations will make for US researchers, but the quality of academic work as in China is not as good, according to the LEE.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Defense Ministry established joint AI centers to bring together partners from industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the creation of an Artificial Intelligence Committee.
In this month, DARPA has just $2 trillion in investment and an initiative announced calling it AI Next.
As for the NSF, which currently invests over $100 million in AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government, which is supposed to have established a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not acted for months.
Macedonia decides to hold a referendum on the name of the country
In a referendum on Sunday, Macedonia will change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move to alleviate its external disputes with Greece, which prevents accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of Noopesland is an attempt to subjugate the province and has urged its veto against its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated a proposal for the new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of the majority slave population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would only vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign showed that it would be difficult for you to achieve 50 percent for the elections to be valid.
The referendum's presidency said: "You are in favour of a NATO and EU membership with acceptance for the agreement with Greece."
Other namesakes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the prize would be paid for inclusion in the organizations such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of Macedonia so that young people can live freely under the precept of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is only legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would be able to get the result of the vote.
A two-thirds majority is needed in the House of Representatives.
The state's election committee would not be able to report any disagreements in the elections until 13 o'clock.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to the 2016 parliamentary elections, where 66 percent of the electorate voted.
"I'm choosing to come for my children, our place as in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko have been known in the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country for the way into NATO and into the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, set up a small stage in silence in front of the tents of those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get up high, only through the backyard," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they want us only as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev, as a member of NATO, would bring our major investments to Macedonia, according to Chomagetaux, which has over 20 percent.
"I believe that because of this, the majority of the population is more than 80 percent for NATO and the EU," said Zaev after leaving the election cab.
He said "yes" would be the result of "confirmation for our future."
A recent poll by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than required.
According to the Macedonian Telma TV poll, 57 percent of the respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent are mated.
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50 per cent must vote plus one.
It would be the first time that the presidential elections would be held in the first round of the pro-Government campaign.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero crosses all of Brighton's defences and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through ‘defense of Brighton at Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero dropped the ball lightly in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian storm crossed a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the lake.
He ran as the first three defenders of Brighton and then hated him open field.
The Aguero as well as 4 opponents.
He's got a little bit of a cock in his head, and he's got a little bit of a cock in his head.
Then he went to the place where the sterling had taken over.
The English as the first ball movement on the field rushed forward and passed back to Aguero, who with the right foot of the goalkeeper of Brighton sat the ball in the right corner.
"Aquero is currently having small problems in his feet," City's manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We had to wait for him to play for 55, 60 minutes.
Dat as happened.
We're happy that he got the shot at the moment."
But one was the Sterling who hated the Sky Blues' initial advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
The Aquero crossed the ball far into the halves of Brighton.
He had a wonderful pass over the left flank of Leroy Sane.
It's a bit of a steep pass, and the sterling has a long pass.
The sky blues had just thrown the ball into the net before it went out.
City plays against Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game at 12h55 at Dénchden in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Joking about the game against the Rockies
With the selection of the nationals in the playoffs, as a reason there to force a new start.
But the always-ready-for-a-challenge joker hopes to take the upper hand against the Colorado Rockies, but only when the Rockies are still in the playoffs that are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinch a wild-card with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday evening, but still struggling to secure their title in the first division.
"And if we don't play for anything, at least we can do a big game, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the public and the other teams that are likely to play at the highest level that I will experience this year.
Why shouldn't I do that?"
It's important to keep in mind that the nationals should be able to play the game, but it's a good idea to make a joke about the situation.
The joker, who will be playing his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and will play a Sunday on his break day.
Washington's reeds as 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA in 300 strikeouts and 220 2/3 live this season.
Trump on the run for election in West Virginia
The president pointed to the situation around his election of Brett Kavanaugh for the House of Representatives while pointing to the importance of a Republican victory in these interim elections.
"Everything that I've seen has been going on in November.
Five weeks before the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones - I'm not running but I'm really running for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these terrible, terribly radical groups of Democrats, you see how it's happening now.
And those who are determined to seize power under all circumstances, you see the sinlessness, the community.
Those as it doesn't matter who hurt them, who they have to overcome for their power and gain control, act as it pleases them, the power and control, we don't give them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resisting and blocking."
"And you see dad in the last four days," he said, describing Democrats as "rose and senseless and crude and deluded."
He mentions the Senate Judiciary Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by the name, which was heavily exploited.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you read the document?
Uh, uh, wat.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Work is no longer God's work.
It's an intolerance to those who think they are intolerant.
When I voted against the vote in my polls, I was a little surprised.
In the end, I'm the last one from a working party that would be welcomed - just because we say wat we think.
My party colleague Joan Ryan has been treated as similar because she is resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, when censorship criticized me, I wasn't right about Jeremy Corbyn.
Matt's view on the importance of a responsible approach in the economy, national security, and Europe, ironically similar attitudes to those Jeremy has complained to leading figures.
The note for Nottingham East Workers' Meeting on Friday says that "we want our meeting to be inclusive and productive."
In most of my 8 years as a local worker representative, the Friday evening meetings were exactly dated.
Sadly, today, as Dat has more than just the tone at many meetings and the promises of "my kindness, my fine" politics than has been forgotten for a long time, anyway, it has ever been so.
It is increasingly striking that other opinions will not be tolerated in the working party and every opinion will be voted as being acceptable to the party.
This as a short time after Jeremy took over the leadership, as colleagues with whom I had previously dubbed we had similar political views on ever realized that I would have taken up the time and position that I would otherwise never have taken up - in the national security as well.
Every time I've publicly sworn - and it's not really important I say - I then get a tirade of remarks on social media against the politics of the middle, and which we say I only have my place in the working party.
It's just my experience.
Nevertheless, I know that it is better for me than for some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are exposed to sexist or racist remarks every day and hardly ever look away.
One of the saddest aspects in these political times is how the level of abuse is becoming more and more normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the workers' party to embrace a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer from God and with every "non-confidence" move or change of selection rules the party is becoming more and more clear.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of advice to keep me quiet, not to be too hard, and then I'd be "in line."
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, preceded by a negligence by the Thatcher government during which my classroom has virtually collapsed, I have tried to improve the public services for those who need it most – be it as local politicians or as government ministers.
I've never hid my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt my political position and the points on which I do not agree with the current leadership.
For those who want to encourage the movement of peace, all I want to say is that if the country faces a Brexit that harms the economy, trade and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my allegiance to the Labour Party.
But the only message I have concerns the Nottingham momentum, it is for my electors, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve and I promise that no threats or political statements will stop me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose Ayr undefeated
Two attempts in the last few years have scored the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves the triumph in this spectacular Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
It's the only one that's out of 10.
In the end, it was a better defense, just as the better seizures of opportunities, which the home team and coach Peter Murchie could be happy about.
"We've been pushed into our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Good for Ayr, they got the chance better than me."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, assisted by Frazier Clima, brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, whom he received in a game by the Warriors, weakened Melrose and Jason Baggot was able to launch an unchanged attempt.
Clima was able to convert a penalty for Ayr, just before half-time, he then converted an attempt alone to score the 17:5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's run, converted by Baggot, was able to reduce the difference to five points.
After an interruption due to an injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was injured, and a new start, Ayr was able to restart through a leg of Stafford McDowall, converted by Clima.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and again, Melrose was able to take advantage of the advantage with a run by Bruce Colvine, after strong pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tightened the climax without a ball on the straw line, Macpherson was able to score a touchdown at the back of the attacking Ayr.
The Clima was able to transform as he did from the beginning after Kyle Rowe was able to start David Armstrong's kickoff and helped flank player Gregor Henry to his fifth run.

Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Martial arts patrols under tackle at the headquarters of La Paz.
Public buildings have raised an ocean-blue flag.
The marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon run under the motto: "The sea belongs to us rightfully.
It's our duty."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost in a 19th-century conflict in Chile is still alive – the will to sail out on the Pacific Ocean again.
At present, the hope is greater than ever, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the spirit of cohesion and freedom and naturally hopes for a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are pursuing the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens in the hope that The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia and – after decades of sporadic talks – force Chile to negotiate with Bolivia on sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who is struggling with a contentious struggle for re-election next year – is heavily reliant on the talks of a Monday.
"We're going to be back to the Pacific shortly before," he said in late August.
But some analysts are of the opinion that the court may not decide in favor of Bolivia - and that not much would change if it did, however.
The UN agency, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, did not have any violence over Chile and notified that it did not interfere in possible conversations.
That the court's decision has already been reached six months after the final proceedings, shows that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In the last four years, the Bolivians have been fighting against the Bolivarians, and they have been fighting against the Bolivarians.
"The question of access to the sea has been torpedoed by the current Bolivian administration," said Zarate.
Morales's combative rhetoric has weakened all Chilean will, clarified.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to carry on the talks after that.
The two countries did not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, as Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rebutted that the court's decision was particularly swift.
On Monday, Bolivia offered "an extraordinary opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "complete a 139-year-old dispute with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime exit as a political springboard.
"Bolivia never ceases to claim its right to access the Pacific," he said.
"It's an opportunity for us to leave our past behind."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen before it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm first if it can't trust Washington.
He spoke in front of the UN General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to keep its promises to the presidents of the rivals at the summit in Singapore.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attempted to re-establish disrupted nuclear negotiations of diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's "a dream" that further sanctions and the United States' assault on a declaration for the Korean War would enforce any and all of Korea's knees.
Washington is cautious to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards a massive disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a general skepticism that Pyongyang thinks it is serious with the disarmament of an arsenal that sees the country as the only guarantee of its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows show a massive rise of head coverings on the streets.
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, then don't look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveil on the catwalk a bunch of oversized head coverings for their SS19 collection, which put the style on parisian fashion weeks in the spotlight.
Absolutely unpractical heat has flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an oversized beige hat with something that resembled a feather in the model's head.
Other oversized accessories with jewelled watermelons, a mixture of hat and pineapple – but they are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne has also released some funny masks – just right for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks have attached lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter than the Haute Couture.
One creation resembles a diving costume complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looks like a melted glasscornet.
And if you want to see me, you're not going to be disappointed.
Keep in mind that you will be able to find a great way to get to your destination.
The oversized heat strongly resembles the feast of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide board, which was already seen in Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical heat that social media has flooded, is sending yet another great creation to the catwalk – a strawberries as big as the model it presents.
The deep orange bast basket, with bast frogs and a white song grip, was the main focus of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection on the Paris Fashion Weeks.
Star stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big heat and beach baskets on our streets next summer - because designers have achieved such a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are indispensable for citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools hold the record for academic performance and this continued in 2018 with new outstanding exam results, which could only be strengthened by individual and collective performance in sports, art, music and other social endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), want to strive for the best level of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for further and higher schools, for their chosen career and their place as a citizen of the world.
As a school with a well-developed and discussed curriculum, we see modern languages as popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "When you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in your own language, it goes into your heart."
This is a strong reminder that we should not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Since these exams, we can see that languages are at the very top, with the best results within the independent schools.
Sixty-eight percent of foreign-language students graduated with an A+.
The data collected by the 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students have an A+ and Mandarin, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish have also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that students and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as electives are now considered the same as majors (sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, but also different in between.
A 2014 survey by the English Commission on Vocational and Skills found that patrons suggest that it is difficult to fill vacancies, 17 percent due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming important in preparing young people for their future tasks.
With more future work opportunities requiring languages, these skills are becoming increasingly important in a global world.
Regardless of the career that one chooses when learning a second language, one has a real head start in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in England, 75 percent are unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, while French as a single language with 15 percent is still in the two-digit area.
That's why it's so important to invest in the learning of languages in today's children.
In other words, with the growth of the economy, children have a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school offers a different language.
A bunch of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while learning other languages that might be more important to England after 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there are always a variety of languages and independent schools to choose from, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are eager to provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve something, no matter what the future looks like.
It cannot be disputed in a global business environment that languages are vital for the future of the country and that must reflect itself in education.
In fact, modern languages must be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools offer these whales, variety and stunning performance for the young people of Scotland.
I'm fine with the fair.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans who are waiting for LeBron James to start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play a Sunday in the pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It just has to be determined how many minutes he plays.
"It's more than one in less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As usual, James was asked at the beginning of this week about his plans for the Lakers' six-player pre-season program.
"I don't need any pre-season players at this point of my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's whale event tour in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins the evening at Wheeling, West Virginia, a heap of whale event campaigns.
It's Trump's first of five tours in the next week, with stations on him friendly sunshine places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote in favour of his elections to the Supreme Court, Trump aims to defer support for the upcoming mid-term elections, from which Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the elections are held in November.
At what time is Trump's West Virginia whale event this evening and how do you watch it online?
Trump's election event for West Virginia is scheduled for today evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 pm ET.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia whale event online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump would refer this week's hearing to the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whose election has been put on ice for a week due to the allegation of sexual abuse with a former senator while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the first goal is to help Republicans become the face of the elections in November and get new swings.
President Trump's campaign said the five events next week aimed to "give volunteers and supporters new energy while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so critical to his agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible during the most important time of the campaign," a spokesman for Trump's campaign said.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the event can bring the evening supporters from "Ohio to Pennsylvania and be treated by the Pittsburg media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, it was the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senator candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is returning to the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to help him get up and running in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a policy scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018 The U.S. team proves courage to keep the hopes of the single fight alive on Sunday
After three single-seat meetings, the quarter-finals can be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging swing pendulum is a very invented sports concept, but one that players believe in, and never more in such competitions as these.
Where do you think the swamp is right?
"They had a lead of six points and now it's the fourth, so we now see that as a small swing," Jordan Spieth said when he finished for today.
Europe has the advantage; of course, playing four points ahead with another twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel a little wind in their sails and they have a lot to be fitted, not in the end the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together every day, and all of them are joined by three of four points.
Spieth was deadly from tea to the green and is an example.
The cheerful keel jaw became harder as his lap progressed, sinking an important putt to pull the match up and where Thomas is two of two behind him.
His putt, through which they won the match at 15, was quit with a similar circle, of that kind, which is a sign that he believes the American team is not out there.
"It's just a game that needs to be played, and it's a game that needs to be played," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of all these games.
18 holes to score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's old, but preferred couples are four out of four ahead and can do nothing more wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't shoot a Saturday afternoon bogey , but they also avoided the Saturday, Friday afternoon and the nine back a Friday afternoon bogey.
On this run, and as their energy seems to flow at and from the spectators, cementing that they are the players who are supposed to beat a Sunday, and there will be no more favorite players to beat a potential European victory when the sun goes down over the Le Golf National, like Fleetwood and Molinari.
At the same time, the two of them are at different angles.
It's a European victory, but it's a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning in Fourball, when he was a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a laugh from which they couldn't get out so quickly.
There's no one there to help you out of laughter.
The four-players are so fascinating because of the interactions between the pairings; the right they give; the right they don't give in the way a strategy and an insight can change.
Europe has so far played better as a team and is going well for the last day, but this four-player session has also shown that the team USA has the will to fight for what has been questioned, especially the states side.
Europe is going 10-6 to the Ryder Cup final day
Europe had a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the fourth ball of a Saturday and the fourth match against the United States with 10-6.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead the game with two wins over a swinging Tiger Woods for their lead to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on European side, who lost the trophy to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a poorly starred American side in the four-balls, seating the series at 3-1.
The U.S. offers more resistance in the four, wins two games, but they do not receive the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 individual matches to hold a Sunday for the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while in Molinari, together with "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, only the second pair are the four-pointers since the first four games in Ryders Cup history.
Against the Woods and Patrick Reed won in the four-ball, they harmonize well against an empty Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau at a sympathetic 5&4.
Woods, who played himself through two games at Samsden, sometimes showed brilliant bursts in the four-ball and four-ball in a row.
Justin Rose, paused in those four-ball mornings, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the fours and beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the first and third ranked in the world.
Europe doesn't just enjoy a beautiful, lovely day in southwest Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas are scoring the final for the Americans with two points at Samsden.
They regained a sweeping 2&1 victory over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the Four Ball and later came back to win against Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the Four although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did a team have a come back from a four-point deficit to enter the singles, though Furyk's side only needed to keep the trophy.
After they were second best for two days, as always, an opposing attack on Sunday looked like not wanted by them.
North Korea says ‘on no account' they would be armed unilaterally without confidence
The North Korean foreign minister has told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are aggravating mistrust against the US and there is no way for North Korea to unilaterally disarm its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea has shown many "good wishes" in recent years, such as the stopping of nuclear and missile testing, decommissioning of the nuclear test site, and not further enlarging nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see a similar response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While Ri rebuts the well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to denuclearization in which North Korea is rewarded for the single step, he stresses his statement in which he does not explicitly denounce a unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has always done in the past.
Ri refers to a joint letter from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump on the first summit between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim negotiated a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States soiled Pyongyang first had to cease its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also appealed for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization-first' and increases the pressure by sanctions to impose itself in a compulsory manner, and raises objections to 'declaration of the end of war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions could force us to our knees is a dream of people who don't know us.
"But the problem is that we're putting our trust in the law."
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, who had beaten a U.S. leader the week before the United Nations.
The minister, however, held three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, saying: "If the party for denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a baggage."
To this extent, the sound of Ri's serene speech was dramatically similar to that of last year, when it was announced before the UN General Assembly that the targets on the US mainland of North Korean missiles were triggered by the "Lord Devil President" Trump as he called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take the first steps towards disarmament, but said that much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it's not important."
China and Russia have pledged to pay Pyongyang for its progress.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue to be steadfast and, in any case, continued until we have achieved a complete, definitive and proven denuclearization process."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea, hoping that they could repeal Pyongyang's nuclear and balistic missile program by deploying funds.
Pompeo met the Ri behind the scenes of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would go back to Pyongyan next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
In July, he left Pyongyang and said that progress had been made, but within hours, North Korea denounced it for its "gangster demands."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a nuclear site and a nuclear complex should the Americans undertake "dementia-pronouncing measures."
He said that Kim would be faced with "dementia-provoking measures" that he seek security guarantees that have secured Trump in Singapore and approach to normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students choose court to be sufficiently rested.
A new court at Harvard University tells all of its students to get more sleep and so try to fight the growing macho culture, in which one goes through the night with coffee in the blood.
One academic found that students of the university, the number one in the world, often have no idea what it means to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham's Women's Hospital, assembled the court, which is the first in the field in America.
He was inspired to start the court after giving a four-resolution on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the fourteenth year, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I going to keep this first, in my last year?'
He said that until now no one had told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The Court, which is offered for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials about how good sleep habits can help academics and sports performance, as well as can bring general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard's medical school and business manager of the university's health services, said that the university decided to offer the court after they realized that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The course, which lasts an hour, offers a range of interactive tasks.
In one part, a picture of a sleeping room is shown, where students can click on coffee bags, horseback riding, sports research and books and then learn about the effects of caffeine and lotion, as well as how sports performance is affected by sleep and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another part, learning that means that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, a stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university area, with interactive icons, then encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We don't know if it's worth changing the behavior of the students directly.
But we believe that they have a right to know that – just as one has a right to know what health problems the smoking of cigarettes brings," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of breaking apart that has been taught all night, still exists, so the professor, and the modern technology and pressure on the students, which is growing, has as a consequence a lack of sleep and is a problem that is growing.
He said that insuring enough quality sleep should be a kind of "secret weapon" against stress, exertion and fear - even to prevent one from contributing, wanting sleep deprivation to the brain and starvation and one having the feeling of always being hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the court, even after choosing one of his courses in the last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the court had opened his eyes and had inspired the court to offer the entire university.
He hopes, in a next step, to get all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students be alerted to when they should go to bed, but also to get up, and beware of harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can cause rhythms from the runway and sleep problems throughout the day.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Menga's goal beats Gerrard's team
The rangers had to endure a further defeat by Dolly Menga's goal, which degraded Steven Gerrard's little-needed side to a 1-0 draw.
Ibrox's side tried to secure their first match since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team brought Gerrard's second defeat and 18 players as coach and left him eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership leader, the Hearts.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before halftime and the line-up of the Rangers team lacked inspiration and could not comply.
While the rangers now slide to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, behind Hiberian by the difference and the goalkeeper.
And there could be further problems coming to the rangers after Abiter Calum Spence had to be treated for a head win, and that was due to an object that apparently was shot at the end of the game.
Gerrard changed sides eight times, which gave him the opportunity to loosen up behind Ayr and get to the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the same Livi 11, which cost the Hearts a point last week and would have been thrilled to see his well-thrilled team hitting opponents here every time.
Although the rangers had the ball more often, Livingston had more with the ball they had hit.
They could have already scored a goal in two minutes in the game when Menga's first pass brought Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder drew his big chance to far.
A deep free shot from Keaghon Jacobs to Captain Craig Halkett gave Alan Lithglow in the defensive only the ability to shoot from afar on the poles.
The rangers were able to win the control, but it looked more like hope than faith and their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had taken a half-meter too good after a quarter-time match with Steven Lawless, but Abiter Steven Thomsen ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers have only scored twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly has almost no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's cap shot and Ovie Ejaria's harmless shot.
While Livi's 34-minute start could be considered a run against the game, no one can claim that they didn't deserve it for their efforts alone.
In the meantime, the runners have agreed to a standard situation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball between Scott Robinson, who kept a cold head and selected Menga for a simple goal shot.
Gerrard responded in the break and swapped Coulibaly against Ryan Kent, which had practically a direct impact as the ex-starter overtook Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came up from the side to block.
But Livingston continued to provide visitors with exactly the genre of game they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett adopting one long ball after another.
The Holt's side could have continued to take advantage of their lead in the last moments, but McGregor kept Jacobs the bass before scoring the Lithgow from a far corner.
The Rangers' interchanged Glenn Middleton had a further right to a half-meter as he clashed with Jacobs, but Thomsen looked away again.
Almanac The inventor of the violin painter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago exactly on the day, and further AIMED... the scouting physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
The violinist developed a method by which one can detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that later became known as the violinist.
Geigerzieler, since becoming a mainstay of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, in 1950 the film "Bells of Colorado" was released with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who laughed more cowboys than scientists:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "This is a violin target, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you don't have the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity and the minerals."
Evans: "Well, now it's going to blow up!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, which is named after him, continues to live on.
New cancer vaccine can help the immune system to detect bipolar cells
New cancer vaccination can help the immune system to detect and kill bipolar cells
Vaccination contributes to the immune system, as it can recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
In the method, immunity cells are taken from a patient and then altered in the laboratory
They can then recognize a protein that is in a lot of cancer cells and then re-injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman who has been treated with the vaccine, which contributes to the immune system to detect malignant cells, the cancer of the egg has disappeared after more than 18 months.
In the method, immunity cells are removed from a patient, then transformed in the lab, so that they detect a protein from many types of cancer, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of various types of cancer," which includes breast, egg, lung and intestinal cancer, as Prof Berzofsky explains.
A similar approach to taking immunity cells from patients and "bringing them along" as one attacks cancer cells has already worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump tirade, with a MAGA cap, after his appearance at SNL.
It's not a good way
Kanye West was featured in the studio during the Saturday Night Live broadcast, following a lengthy performance in which U.S. President Donald Trump starred and said he would be presidential candidate for 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, which is called Ghost Town, he wore a cap with the inscription Make America Great, cut back against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'
"If I were to deal with racism, I would have been expelled from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the broadcast with a sketch featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star makes himself over the board Kavaunagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in charges of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not transmitted, the West's tirade has been uploaded through social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if they've been trying to get their hands on the West.
The West also complained to the audience that he had backstage problems due to his cape.
"They've been messing with me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out like that with the cap."
They've bullied me!
And then they said that I was ill," he said, as the Washington Examiner said.
The West went on to say, "You want to see that sunny place?", followed by a statement that "he would wear his Superman costume, no one can tell us what I can do. You want the world to go ahead?
I'll try the lion."
His comments have brought at least two booths with the audience and the SNL cast looked like it was embarrassing to them, as Variety writes, and one person said to the publication, "The whole studio was totally quiet."
The West has replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose colleague, rapper Mac Miller, had died two days earlier.
West has irritated others with the performance of the song I Love It, wanting to see how a Perrier’s bottle was dressed.
The West received support from the conservative group TPUSA's fourth-ranking, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "And one of those brave heads: THANK YOU FOR HEALING THE MOB'S STAR."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West is simply "who's who, and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I choose DOGEINT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or his "art") in which I think a harmful ideology that my community might like to spread.
He's free.
But we are," she said.
The rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "the artist formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the later muse-bearing Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then renamed himself "the artist previously known as Prince."
Morduklo's attempts at knife picking in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant was convicted before the Belfast Magistrates' Court.
The points of the complaint are checked by the Public Prosecution Service.
The Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks harmful masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his powerful role as Jon Snow in HBO's brutal fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31 years old, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often give young men the feeling that they need to mimic the strong man to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he was "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of harmful masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, is said to be "quite stubborn" about the subject.
"I feel personal, quite stubborn, at the moment - where did you go with the manuscript?" he said.
"What did we bring to men when they grew up, according to the terms of the problem we see today?"
The kit believes that television is partially responsible for the increase of harmful masculinity, precisely because of its extremely masculine characters.
He asks, "What is taught and what is taught?"
What is being taught on television and on the streets that young men must be of the certain side of men?
I think that's one of the big issues of our time - how do we change that?
There's definitely something wrong with young people."
In the interview, he also concluded that he would not want to make a four- or four-story of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that he has enough of "battlefields and horses."
From November onwards, Kit is worth seeing in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor once said that he found his wife Rose's cannibalism the worst thing that came from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so in that sense she gave me my future family, and my life from now on," he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the home of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV or AIDS has risen by 14%.
Health experts say that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
The 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, which marked a difference.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through various parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who were infected with HIV on that road had fallen to almost zero, as Chinese health experts said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Over the next year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of those transmissions of diseases come from insufficient protection and those relationships.
Since 2003, China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to get the problem under control.
Maxine Waters denies that matu workers have leaked data from GOP senators, speaking of "dangerous lies" and "complication theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters has denounced the Sami rumours that a member of her matu staff would have published personal information from three Republican U.S. Senators on the legislatures on their Wikipedia page.
The Democrat from Los Angeles insisted that the claims were cited by "extremely right" figures in websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the released information were apparently private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared on the thunderstorms online, uploaded by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the submissions, has a line to the Waters Office, and they have released information about a member of the Waters maturing staff, according to lawmakers at The Hill.
"These unfounded claims are completely false and an absolute lie," the Waters said.
"The member of my matu staff – whose identity, personal information, and security and danger are as a result of those dishonest and false claims – has in no way anything to do with the leaking of this information.
"This accusation is completely false and a complete lie."
Waters' statements were quickly criticized online, including the former White House press spokesman, Ari Fleischer.
"It's a scam," the man wrote.
"It's clear that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of having something they don't have, they shouldn't be offended.
Don't try to defy one.
You shouldn't have to question the friends of those who are in charge.
It has to be quiet and quiet."
The butcher manifested himself to compare the Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being outraged during the innocence of the thunderstorm.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is well-respected of the water elections, has also posted his opinion on Twitter.
"Beautiful," he whispered.
In its statement, the Water said that its bureau "informed the appropriate authorities and the responsible party of the application of the law about these false claims."
"We are confident that the blame will come to the people of the day," she continued, "and that they will be held accountable for here actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my office."
Johnny English Strikes Again Criticism – Little Intoxicating Rowan Atkinson Parody
It has become a tradition to now look into all new British movies Brexit remakes, which does not seem appropriate in the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise. This began in 2003 and was relaunched again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Isn't it worth the irony of self-satisfaction, which obviously portrays us as stupid, that this nation is an opportunity for export?
Regardless, the gloomy and incompetent Johnny English with a plastic face has his letter for a second time to mislead everything – the name of him already says enough, namely, that it is a wide-ranging comedy creation intended for non-English-speaking theatergoers in other territories.
He is of course a stupid secret agent who, although has a funny appeal for idiot glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a stroke of Mr. Bean, and a clash of that type who has a single note to the "Chariots of Fire" main member at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also actually based on the traveler and international man of the mysterious, who once played Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclaycart television commercials, leaving chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this current Johnny English movie.
I was thrilled by the scene where Johnny English arrives at a helicopter, dressed in a medieval armor, while the rotating helicopter blades clapped briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's Don for Physical Comedy can be seen, but the humor feels "submerged" and strangely exuberant, especially the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible also now want to offer more persuasive comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it was meant for children and not for adults, and to me Johnny English's stupid misadventures are just not as original and focused as Atkinson's daf-stummed sketches in the person of the bean.
The current situation is that the United Kingdom is facing serious difficulties.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super-secret internet network of spies in the UK revealing the identities of all the agents in Asaitz – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop that brings the barrel to a halt for the Prime Minister, a pompous and combative figure who is already involved in a total collapse of political unrest: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this so-called Theresa May character, but there's not much to see in the script.
Here, secret agents inform them, wanting each and every spy is in danger of having to bring back someone from retirement.
And that means the murmuring Johnny English and person, now hired as the school director of a distinguished establishment, but giving secret courses like one gives a spy: some dear jokes here, the English wants to set up an Art School of Rock-sounding spy school.
The English has been expedited back to Whitehall for a brief briefing and urging and reunited with his old suffering-tested sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, with a submarine commander, a sober role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin are all wrong in the name of their Majesty's secret service again in action and make the acquaintance of Olga Kurylenko's wife Fatale, the Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister dangerously falls for a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he could solve Britain's computer problems: the gloomy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
The English and the Bough begin an odyssey of farce alternate maneuvers: disguised as waitresses, they set up a French restaurant in flames; they provide chaos to the shores of Volta's luxury yacht; and the English leave behind some anarchy as he tries to do a virtual reality headset for himself.
All the sketches are sure to be taken out for the last sequence, but as friendly and burskikos everything is, it already has something of children's television in the big picture.
It's pretty messy.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't imagine: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for Britain that would run a four-day week paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan in which the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party apparently wants the heads of enterprises to return the savings they have gained through the revolution of artificial intelligence to the workers through an extra free day.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day week - but paid equally.
Sources say that the idea would be consistent with the parties' economic agenda and also with plans to separate the country and favor the worker.
To switch to a four-day business week is supported by the Trades Union Congress, as a way for workers to become the advantages of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A review of politics is expected to be announced at the end of the year.
It's not worth overnight, but a four-day business week is an aspiration that aligns with the party's approach to rebalancing the employee's economy and favor in the party's general industrial strategy.
The Labour Party was not the first to put forward such an idea, the Greens had already spoken out in the 2017 election campaign for a four-day week.
However, this is not the case for the entire Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: "A four-day week is not a general party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Treasury Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference of last week to celebrate his vision of a social revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to revoke the power of "faceless dictators" and "profits" from supplying companies.
The Treasury also plans that current shareholders and water companies could not obtain investments here if a Labour government could demand certain "deductions" on the grounds of false practices.
He also confirmed plans to ensure that embezzlements would be placed in the fourth floor of enterprises and the so-called "Inclusive Ownership" fund would give 10% of the profits of private sector companies to workers, who could then receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's investigation could change opinions here
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, which raises the question of whether the Bureau's (FBI) findings could convince Republican senators to give their support only.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out something new that would get them to change their minds.
Kennedy has worked more openly than his fellow worker from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"As soon as I entered the audience, I said that I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, this accusation came out, and really said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined, determined."
But Graham's vow was written in stone.
"My opinion on Kavanaugh's board is firm and there has to be a particularly stubborn accusation to be made for them," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: The board vehemently disputed it," Graham said in the context of Christine Blasey Ford.
"Everyone who calls them can't do anything.
It's been 36 years here.
I don't see anything new that could change the situation."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
These gatherings are worth holding in New York again the Global Citizen Festival, an annual museum event that has an immensely impressive line-up of stars that are worth performing, but has an equally impressive mission: ending poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is worth attracting thousands of people at Central Park's "Great Lawn," not only to see such musical acts as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to attract people to the real goal of the event, i.e., the 20th century.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that fights poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), people who go to the concert must perform a number of tasks, or "actions," such as volunteering, writing an e-mail to a leader in the world, calling someone, or carrying out other tasks that help end the goal of poverty.
But how much success did Global Citizen have, with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, an honest way to demand from people that they become active or again a case of “clicktivism” – people who would make a real change by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has registered more than 11 million "actions" of its supporters targeted at different goals.
They say the actions helped them get global leaders to advertise commitments and unlock policies of more than $37 billion worth of aid to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 exposures and reports coming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the collected money so far has had an impact on nearly 649 million people in the world.
One of the main investors, including The Power of Nutrition, is a UK-based partnership of investors and emitters who are committed to "helping children realize their full potential," and promise - after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens - to fight Rwanda for $35 million.
"Mum support from the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can face social injustice from malnutrition to a footstool in history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience of the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that more than 5,000 actions have been addressed to the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and that the government has announced the financial support of a project, The Power of Nutrition, worth reaching more than 5 million women and children with nutritional support.
In response to a FAQ on the website, which asks "what makes you think you might end up in extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen responded: "It's worth a long and hard way - sometimes I fall and fail.
But as all the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we value success, we want to be stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe are just some of the artists who will perform in New York this year, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
U.S. could use a Navy blockade to restrict Russian energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington said that "if necessary," they would deploy the Navy here to stop Russian energy from coming to the marches, including in the Middle East, as U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke betrayed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia’s involvement in Syria – where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government – would all be just a screen for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they want to be in the Middle East, just as they want to be in Eastern Europe and there in the southern part of Europe, to convey energy," he apparently said.
If anyone can believe him, there are always ways to do so.
"The American states of America have the ability, with our navy, to make sure that sea routes are open, and, if necessary, to block them to make sure that energy is not coming to market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance - an American NGO that sees itself as "the voice of the energy consumer."
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran and noted that they are ultimately the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are turning, more or less, towards exercising pressure and replacing fuel," he said, while in the context, Russia is seen as an economy that is totally dependent on fossil energy.
The claim comes while Trump's administration is on a mission to increase the exports of natural liquefied gas to Europe, to replacing Russia, which is a significantly cheaper option for the European consumer.
As a result, employees of the Trump administration, and Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which – if one listens to Trump – Berlin would be captured by Moscow.
Moscow has often claimed that the 11-billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a few economic projects.
The Kremlin argues that the vehement opposition to the Washington project is simply driven by economic reasons and that this would be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that it should be possible for consumers to choose their provider," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has been criticized by Germany, which has once again reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federal Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the United States to stand out from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren deserves a "good look" if she's going to be a presidential candidate for 2020, said Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "look good" if she went into the races for the presidency after the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that they were considering applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and run our footy government, and that also means a woman at the top," she said, according to voices from The Hill.
"On November 6th, I'm going to see if I'm going to be president and run for president."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying he "would lead the country into a wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what's going on with Donald Trump," she said.
Warren has been open to criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before being elected."
There's a lot of evidence to show that Warren's own electorate is not going to be able to compete in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, eighty-five percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters are of the opinion that it should not be contested.
Two-thirds of the population found a good idea.
The study showed that there is more support for the governor of the past, Deval Patrick, with eighty-eight percent who are in favour of it and eighty-eight percent who are against it.
Other high-profile Democrats mentioned in the context of the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that he would officially decide to attend by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump event
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What permeates my bow, what permeates him since he's back home, I can share with other families who are struggling with PTSD ramifications, and with the injuries our soldiers are coming back with," she told an audience at an event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other veterans "are returning a little different, they are more hurried, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what the other soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the military, have been involved with."
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic bodily injury to a woman, and that together in the report on general domestic violence and possession of a weapon in the alcoholic state, said Dann Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support the Defi for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge for a new U.S. policy prohibiting victims of gang violence or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of 18 states in the district have entered a memoir "amicus curiae" ("ami de la cour") in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the Réquerant in the Grace vs. Sessions complaint, which the American Civil Liberties Union opposed to federal policies in August, has not been publicly reported.
She said that her partner, "in his violent constructions, which are gang members," had been abused, but U.S. officials had rejected a request for asylum here on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The states here advocates who support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of requests for U.S. asylum come, as nations that are constantly facing problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement that the new policy would "ignore state law, federal law and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum requests be granted the facts and circumstances of the request, and such a court goes against the principle," says the "ami de la cour."
Affected people continue to argue in the memoir that policies would not allow immigrants to enter, which would harm the U.S. economy, if they were likely to become entrepreneurs, and a "important offer of workers."
In June, attorney general Jeff Sessions demanded that judges grant asylum only to victims who want to escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is possible for those who leave their country due to persecution or fear based on their race, religion, nationality or wish to be members of a particular social group or political opinion," the sessions said on 11 June in its presentation of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even all the serious ones – with which people around the world have to deal every day.
Desperate efforts to save Palu while the number of dead doubles compared to survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more unpredictable.
"It all feels at ease," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while trying to calm her little feverish baby at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings in bodies.
There's almost no water here."
Inside, they were seen returning to destroyed homes by searching through corrupted property to save no matter what.
Hundreds of people were injured and the spindles, damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale, were overcrowded.
Some of the Blessed Ones, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, ran outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the unpleasant neighbors.
When he felt like it was on the 5th floor of the hotel room that he shared with his wife and his girlfriend, experiencing a brutal earthquake, he got tears in his eyes.
"There was no time to save us.
I've been quashed in the ruins of the walls, many of them," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what's going on here or with my child.
I hope they are safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accused China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement that boosted the benefit of mutual US-China trade in a US daily, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press for propaganda purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the advertising paid by China in the Des Moines Register — Iowa state’s best-selling newspaper — after a China accused of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, which China disputes.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections is a new phase of Washington's escalation campaign to put pressure on China, according to a U.S. official.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertising for trade, Beijing and Washington are in a de-escalating trade war, which has led to higher tariffs being imposed on the other's imports.
China’s retaliation tariffs at the start of the trade war were expected to hit exporting states like Iowa – which support Trump’s Republican party – such Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former longtime Governor of Iowa – an important exporting state of agriculture to China – says Beijing wants American workers, farmers and businesses to do the same.
China, as Branstad wrote in an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now about to lease another ship by now publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press."
Through the spread of propaganda, the government of China is opposing the beloved and long-standing tradition of freedom of parole in the free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, on the newspaper stand at the bottom of Beijing's street, there is little opposition and no real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese could have expressed against the economic development of their country," the Chinese Communist Party said in a statement.
He also said that "some of the most famous Chinese newspapers don't want to print their article," but he didn't know how.
The Republicans are evolving from women's voters ahead of the interim election with debacle in Kavanaugh, warn analysts
While many top Republicans behind the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh stand and defend against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned against a counter-reaction in the election, especially from women.
Emotions around the subject were extremely high and most Republicans said they would like to go ahead with the vote.
"Those things can't be rolled back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, who spoke to The Hill for an article published a Sunday.
Reeher said that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute push for an FBI investigation was only worthwhile.
"Women don't value what happened yesterday - they don't forget tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a high-ranking adviser in national porte slogans for the progressive group MoveOn, the Friday, if one can believe a Washington D.C. newspaper.
The protesters, as they walked away from the Senate ranks, sang "November is coming!" while Republicans controlling the "Judiciary Committee" decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a mic report.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation values are extreme," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's high; it's true.
But it could go even higher, especially among the so-called female "swing voters", and the four-star and young voters, 18-29-year-olds, who - although they did not love the president - often do not get elected.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which they provide an accurate description of the sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggest that it could be backfiring if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"It's a confusing move for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former Republican four-seater of the National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee vote or the last vote or whether the Kavanaugh judge will be, it's also a question of how the Republicans handled the whole thing and how they treated them," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats be elected, a TV channel.
But Americans seem to be somehow biased about what they should believe of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, although there is a tendency to believe the slanderer more.
A recent YouGov survey found that 41 percent of respondents definitely or perhaps believe Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they definitely believe Kavanaugh.
A plus, 38 percent say they believed Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his statement, while only 30 percent say the same about the Ford.
After the flake, the FBI is now investigating Ford's and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian wrote.
Ford swore on oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had abused her in a drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court has exposed the genitals of nominees at a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new Internet to go against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has started a startup that is supposed to be a competitor of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where data is stored and who should have access to water information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that his intention behind the intrusion was "the world dominance."
"We need to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can bring together contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, museum libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all together on one browser, and that all the time.
What is unique about "personal online data store" is that it is entirely dependent on the user who can have access to what information.
The company calls it "personal emancipation through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, process qualifications, and acquire skills to be so solidly accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of the Berners-Lee, the Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few matu workers working as developers on the project in a community of volunteer encoders.
From that week on, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized app with the tools found on the intrusion website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether or not they should make a complete change, where all business models here are put on the head overnight.
"We're not allowed here."
In a post on Medium, published by Samsten, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem worth protecting the integrity and quality of the new web on solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet as he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee was an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: World War I pastor celebrated with "Victoria cross"
The only clergyman from the Church of England who ever received a Victoria cross as a fighter during World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lt. Col. The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Order on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglie and Lehaucourt.
However, he was captured by a sniper four days later and never realized that he had been awarded the highest British military victory.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by a group of his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it would be "ingeniously symbolic" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after the action of his bop, which removed him from the Médaille.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann drove his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog and under attack on the field and by machine guns."
He later ran to the shooting line and again drove the battalion, before he took a field weapon with one hand and joined three of the military units.
Lt. Col. Vann was brought in by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said the actions of his grandfather "couldn't be justified but it would be a humiliating experience."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says that he "feels very honored to be a part of the parade" and also said that "the courage of a real hero is proved by the support of many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine the following: You've stayed up all night to watch a packed Bellator 206, only to be denied the viewing of the main line.
On schedule were 13 battles from San Jose, including six on the main map and they were shown on Channel 5 all night long live in the United Kingdom.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to oppose, spectators in the United Kingdom were astonished as the coverage was switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake for the fight until the early morning hours.
One fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program," said David Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communications, as he was addressed on the transmission.
"Peppa the pig, Jo."
The company president of Bellator Scott Coker said they want to revise their appointment plans to accommodate viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think that when I think about the replay, I think that we can probably do that," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning and we're not in a position to raise this to Sunday's time, Monday's time.
But we'll make it.
Believe me, when it was switched there, they were sent a lot of messages here, and they were all not friendly.
We tried to fix this, we thought it was a technical disruption.
But it wasn't, it was a legal problem.
I can assure you that next time it won't happen again.
We reduced the fight to 5 instead of 6 – as we always do – and we tried to deliver more to the fans, but we screwed it up.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "deprived" of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he was raised with the feeling of being inferior to anyone because of his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't realized until he came to the secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
In conversation with the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had spoken about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that he wanted to win the Olympics, and that he wanted to win the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken an interruption of a few months due to a disease.
During her appearance as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt as he grew up "less worth being" than anyone else, because "socially it was not acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, the feelings are less and less worth feeling, the only things that have given us the power and endurance to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "worthy," he said, so that he would not be disappointed when they finally figure out his sexual preferences.
The two-time bronze winner at the Olympics is one of the most famous LGBT advocates and he made his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, calling for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke about this because he feels happy, able to be open and want to live without consequences and do other "hope."
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “surprised me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When a young man goes through so much" - he attended his first Olympics at the age of 1 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find one who was as old as he was in the same heights and depths.
The couple became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know what; there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His father's name is the same as his father Robert, who died of cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had their tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not there to sit in the first row,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he ceased with oaths, and it was only when he ceased with oaths and death that I finally admitted that he was not unmovable," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive at the Olympics in front of a crowd at home, there's no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – Proud by Heather Small – that he played in the background, as he prepared for the Olympic Games and still caused him a dermis.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Mickey Mouse at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to regain his form to avoid an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a 12th record at the event, which takes place every 2 years, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Furyk for four balls and four a Saturday.
Instead of standing at the center of the action, as he did so often for the United States, the five-time main winner spent his day playing cheerleaders and working on the ranks of his game, hoping to improve what he was plotting.
Not even at the peak of his career, he was the most famous driver, and therefore the 48-year-old player is not the ideal cast for the narrow leagues of Le Golf National, where the long-ruined rough missed shot is punished.
And if the ties aren't scary enough, in the ninth game, Mickelson meets British Open champion Francesco Molinari on Sunday, forming a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans with four points back start the 12 individual players, having a difficult start, then the match of Mickelson could prove to be absolutely important.
He trusted his wife, but he didn't think he could do anything else.
"He fully understood his role for today, knocked me on the back, put his arms around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a strong self-confidence.
He is on the table and has contributed to these teams in the past and this week as well.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I had more ideas, but it worked and as we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could represent the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never really reached the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 lost players and seven halves, but Furyk said that his presence had brought far more intangible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's whimsical, he likes to be funny about others and he's a wonderful person who loves to be in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun when they were on the road with him, and also this week, which was fun to watch.
He's much more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a fairly large lead for the singles of the last day in the Ryder Cup can turn very quickly into an uncomfortable ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a side with captain Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans, but it still won by no length with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only scarcely," said Bjorn, depicted after taking the class of 2018 so far a Friday and yesterday's golf season at 5:6.
The story will show me and everyone in that team that this is not over yet.
Give it all up tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
This isn't over until you see points on the bride.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy, and we must continue to focus on that.
I've been saying it all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Speaking of the game, Bjorn said, "I'm never going to be in the first place.
Tomorrow, we've got another one in front of us.
Tomorrow, it's the ones that are going to come out, and that's another pair of shoes.
It's great to be outside with a partner when things are going well, but if you're alone outside, then you'll be tested as a golfer up to blood.
This is the message that you need to send to the player: Get your hands on tomorrow.
Now let your partner return and he must go his way and also be his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, wants his players to beat each other better, as they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three of four points.
Furyk himself knows both sides of those big turns because he was part of the winning team in Brookline before they went out of place as losers because Europe played out the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response to the question when Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gathered his players last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd love to greet the happy start you've seen in Brookline, you've seen in Medinah.
If the pendulum swings in one direction, then a lot of pressure is exerted on the middle players.
"We've made it clear to the people that we're going to be able to do the magic."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the show and faced Rory McIlroy in the lead role, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the other half of the line-up.
"I've decided to do this because I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about his single choices.
Germany's new warship is re-opened
The latest frigate of the German Navy was commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the time of the Cold War, but it is, according to local media, due to defective systems and ever-larger costs not finished before at least next year.
The order of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the frigate class Baden Württemberg, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper "Die Zeit", which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after the ship's delivery saw the fate of the ambitious project at home.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which the Navy had already ordered in 2007, were intended to replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
They have a powerful gun, a raid of air and ship missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and battery signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible that the latest frigates do not occupy the home port for up to two years.
But the constant delays mean for the innovative warships – which are supposed to prove Germany’s impact and oversight – that they are already outdated before they even enter service, noting “Die Zeit”.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media called a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that would have rendered the ship useless in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class are operated by a crew of almost 120 sailors – even half the staff of the old frigates of the Bremen-class.
It also turned out that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and reduces the ability of the Navy to achieve future improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class, which the Germans employed in World War II.
In addition to the flawed hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the team - also becomes a problem.
It is estimated that it has already reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – of the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are especially important due to recent warnings that the German naval strike force is leaving behind.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was "expending the aceable ships."
The officials said that the problem has worsened over time because old ships have been stolen, but no new ships have been prepared.
He claimed that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class would be able to join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of Flantermais
A new research that has been conducted on a plot of land in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how flantermais use the landscape on their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide a new light on the behavior of the unique flight mothers and will help to provide guidelines for future protective activities.
The study is conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland and tracks common and meccan flantermais but also brown laangour and daubenton flantermais at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed at important locations around the grounds to monitor the outdoor activities throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers also perform mobile recording with the help of hand detectors.
Based expert analysis of all records determines the frequency of the flank excretors and what kind of what does.
A map and a report of the living space are then produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal how an area of the habitat is most important to the flora and how they are used of any kind.
This information helps to determine the benefits of living space management work, such as the creation of knowledge and how forest areas are best looked after for flantermais and other similar types.
The population of Flantermaus has declined significantly in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom in the last century.
They are affected by buildings and development work that result in sleeping places and a loss of living space.
Wall rods and lightning can also pose a risk, just like moulded and chemical treatments of building materials, but also attack of home cheeses.
Flamingos aren't really blind.
But due to their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a highly developed echocalization technique to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the flow of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes Flantermais very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly carry out recordings, sleep screenings and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated flanmere reserve in Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which provides a habitat for eight of Scotland's ten flanmere species.
David Thompson says the land is the ideal landscape for it.
"Hey in Threave, we have a wonderful area for flantermais," he said.
"We have the old buildings, the old trees and the wonderful living space.
But there's a lot we still don't know about flantermais, so the work we're doing here and on other foundations will help us better understand what they need to be able to accomplish."
He emphasized the importance of searching for flantermais before a maintenance is carried out on plots, as an unintentional destruction of a single upbringing room could kill up to 400 female and young flantermais and thus possibly exterminate a very local population.
Flantermais are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their living space.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, called on the public to step up to help.
She said, "We still have to learn a lot about flantermais and for many of our species we just don't know how it affects their populations."
Ronaldo has been accused of rape and his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charge a "false report" by saying that people "want to make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyers want to accuse the German news magazine "Der Spiegel" of publishing the false allegations.
Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he then paid $375,000 to not bring the incident to the public, the "Mirror" reported a cheerful report.
When he was reported hours after the allegations, speaking in an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the reporters as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they're saying today, they're false reports," said the five-time winner of Ballon d'Or in the camera.
"They wanted to advertise for themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by calling my name, but that belongs to work.
I'm a happy and very good man," the player added with a laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to denounce "The Mirror" for the false allegations, which they call "inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player wants to demand compensation for "moral damage with a sum that corresponds to the sword of violation, which will be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he had allegedly been raped anally, according to documents from the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed Ronaldo had fallen on his knees after the alleged incident and had said he was "99 percent" a "good guy" apart from that "single percent."
The documents claimed Ronaldo had confirmed that the two had had sex, but that it had taken place with mutual agreement.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police, and that had photos of her injuries, which were shot in the hospital, but had later agreed to resolve the case amicably, because she had "great fear of retaliation" and feared being "deemed" to have taken revenge measures.
The 34-year-old woman says she would now try to break up the marriage because she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was just about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged overthrow, and this summer he switched with a 100-million deal at Italian top club Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will be prepared to lose its car manufacturers forever"
The United Kingdom "will prepare for eternity" if it loses its status as a world-leading car manufacturer, Economy Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it would be "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily suspend production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of delays at the border could cost jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The factory in Burnaston – where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are produced – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK falls out of the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers from the United Kingdom have also expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade should work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main considerations are related to what, according to automakers, supply chain risks in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run "manufacturing synchronously," with parts arriving every 37 minutes from customs shipments both in the United Kingdom and from the EU for cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be an interruption at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages in parts.
It would then be impossible for Toyota to keep a stock of more than a day at the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and thereby production would stop.
Mr Clark told Theresa May her Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid cross-border checks."
"We absolutely need a deal, we want the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success now, but also to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The statement not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to carry out what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run, they warned that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union leader of Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I can say that if these jobs are lost, they will never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein, according to the White House, may be rescheduled
Donald Trump's unfortunate meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "could be delayed for another week," as the fight for candidate Brett Kavanaugh for the Federal Supreme Court was still unacceptable, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, who, in the event of a possible interference of the Russians in elections, is investigating links between Trump supporters in Russia and a potential impeachment of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump is expelling the Deputy Attorney General and thus putting Mueller's independence at stake is the number one issue in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about being persuaded to record conversations with Trump and about the possibility of repealing the president over the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein disagreed with the report.
But last month he went to the White House and, according to reports, he was able to stay there.
A meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not "get out" Rosenstein, but you were denied the meeting to avoid an overlap with the administration of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of close sexual misconduct, were all angry.
On Friday, Trump called for an FBI investigation of a week's allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meetings, she replied: "There has been no date yet for this, it could be this week, it could also be that I have to resign it after a week, with all the other things left at the Federal Supreme Court.
But I'm still looking at it and I always like to keep the press in the last place."
Some reporters have questioned the claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing from the White House since September 10.
Hosted by Chris Wallace.
Sanders argued that the lack of information was not caused by an aversion to television reporters, which is based on "effect hacking," even though she admitted, "I do not argue the fact that they are engaged in effect hacking."
You've been told that there will be more direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president holds more R&D meetings than any president before him," she said, adding no evidence: "We've looked at the numbers."
Information rounds are still taking place, Sanders said, but "but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president directly, then it's definitely better to talk to me.
We're trying to do that a lot and you've seen that we've done that a lot over the past few weeks, and that replaces a press briefing in the future if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or speeches attending press conferences.
Press conferences alone.
In New York City this week, the president may have proved why by presenting a labyrinthine and heavily bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
The Minister of Health has called on EU workers to join NHS Scotland due to Brexit fears
The health minister has written to the EU staff of the Scottish NHS (State Health Service) to express the country's gratitude and urge them to stay even after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeanne Freeman sent a letter about six months before the United Kingdom exited the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to take over the cost of an application for a regulated status for EU citizens working in its delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit are advancing and there are expected decisions for this autumn.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this must be a time for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we care for.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay."
Christion Abercrombie's head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie suffered a head injury after a head injury in the 31:27 defeat of Vanderbilt Commodores a Saturday, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee state coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury happened shortly before half-time.
"He's gone down to the ground and he's gone down," Reed said.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the seed line and placed him on a beer and brought him afterwards for a further verdict.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center's surgery.
Harris added that "there is no detail on the nature/extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
This is Abercrombie, a college athlete in his 2nd year, his first season at Tennessee State after the transfer of Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers must pay higher stamp taxes if they buy a land item in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp costs if they buy a plot of land in the United Kingdom, using the additional tax under the Tory plan to help the homeless.
The move neutralizes the success of Corbyn's action to attract young voters
The tax increase is imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Financial experts expect them to climb to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp costs if they buy a plot of land in the United Kingdom, with the additional tax being used under the Tory plan to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's action, attracting young voters with promises, providing more affordable housing, and aiming at good earners.
The stamp tax increase is imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, while the additional money reinforces the struggle of the government against sleeping on the streets.
The additional tax – which is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second-floor residents in coffee-to-loan houses – could amount to up to three percent.
Financial experts expect the step to reach <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom citizens, which drives prices and light and makes it difficult for first-timers to get foot in the residential building.
Many rich areas in the country – especially in the capital – have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new guideline comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax to help younger people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping land prices high by buying up land, but not using it, and he urged Ms. May to give up quotas on affordable homes, in order to avoid "domestic overcrowding" by Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a striking raid on housing reform proposals, including loyer controls and an end to forced evacuations "without guilt."
He also wants to give the community more authority to build new homes.
Ms May said: "Last year I said that I would use my tenure as Prime Minister to revive the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that's what it means to repair the wreckage.
The UK is always open to people who live, work and want to build a life.
It may not be true that it is for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to buy homes such as British berries.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away and the enjoyment of sleeping on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland CEO Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become manager of Scotland.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is just in third place in the League One, three points away from the top.
He entered the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership (1st League of Scotland) in the last season.
"I want to be a player for my country.
I got a B-cap and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching a lot of games from Scotland to Hampden as a child with my father and that's something that's always pulled me back.
But that's only going to happen when I'm in the club."
Ross's predecessor as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he is not afraid to follow such established names at such a large club, while he has previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the end of the day, I was asked, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and equipment of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I would only consider myself successful here if I could return the club there."
Ross has only three years of experience as a manager, after a time as an assistant manager in Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the loss in the third league and transform St Mirren from the loss candidate to the championship title winner in the following season.
And Ross says he now feels better than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I think it's a good idea," he recalls when he came to the house.
"I really felt that the administration was the right thing for me to play even more.
It sounds odd, but I have beaten myself well, been able to live well and have enjoyed some welcome highlights.
But playing can make sense.
There's a lot of stuff that needs to be done every week.
I still do this as stress and pressure through the work, but the administration just feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now that I'm doing it, it feels like the best thing I've done as an adult in my entire life."

The perfect time for a pint is Sunday at 5:30, according to a study
The summer heat wave has increased the revenue of British pubs fighting for survival, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups experienced an increase of 2.7 percent in July – but revenues in restaurants declined 4.8 percent, as figures show.
Peter Martin of the consulting firm CGA, which compiled the numbers, said: "Unsustainable sunshine and the longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern as June, when the pubs increased by 2.8 percent.
The decline of 1.8 percent in June in restoration continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars and bars were much more crowded than the restaurants had to offer.
Pubs and those who eat will also suffer under the sun, although not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to drink something.
In all managed pubs and bars, drink sales rose by 6.6 percent that month, while eating was three percent down."
Paul Newman of Leisure and Hospitality Analyst RSM said: "The results continue to lead the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impacts of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales on the out-of-home market.
It's not surprising that restaurant group continues to struggle, but a sales drop of 4.8 percent year-on-year is in addition to the sustained cost pressure, especially as.
The long, extremely hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators in the food industry and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring such urgently expected otempause."
In July, sales in all pubs and restaurants, including re-openings, increased by 2.7 percent, which also reflects the slowdown in brand re-openings.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – one of whom is just 11 – has secret social media accounts, according to a survey, which they hide from their parents and schoolteachers.
A survey of 20,000 schoolchildren from secondary school has revealed an intrusion in "fake insta" pages
The news has driven the fear that sexual content would be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main account" they showed to the parents
One out of five children – one of whom is just 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary schoolchildren revealed a rapid increase in "fake insta" accounts - a playback on the Instagram photo-free website.
The news prompted the fear that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they would run a reported "main account" that they show to the parents while also having a private one.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who called out, "Rape me."
Research by Digital Awareness UK at the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which had been allowed to operate private accounts.
HMC's Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online areas where parents and schoolteachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the "Vocabulary of Athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee at the annual General Assembly of the Supervisory Board as a Supervisory Board member.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated lightweight athlete and chairman Ian Beattie saw the move as a significant opportunity for those who practice sports to benefit from their broad experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the athletics community of all Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly if we had to take the lead," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help to conduct sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-metre run at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and held a total of 4 Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC expert, can no longer go after having a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke before a mountain.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only with time it turns out whether and to what degree I recover.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to go again, and today I do mobility exercises!
"Thank you for the warnings!"
Advertising for milk pumpkins, comparing mothers to cows, reaches the middlemen online
A company for milk pumpkins has reached the middle with an online advertisement that compares stealing mothers to cows that are strangled.
For the launch of the so-called "first unobtrusive portable milk pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie has released a non-serious music-video-inspired advertisement to highlight the freedom of mothers – who pump off milk – with new genes.
Four real mothers dancing in a hee-filled chest to a music that contains the following lyrics: "Yes, I stroke myself, but you don't see a dick" and "In case you didn't notice it, they don't say that they're my breast."
The choir continues to sing, "Pompou or, pompou or, I feed my puppies, pompou or, pompou or, I brush my ladies."
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video triggered mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It's a bad choice to use to promote this product.
"Just as we have to conceive and give birth to give birth to milk, except that their little ones are taken away a few days after birth," one wrote.
Elvis's mother-in-law's mother-in-law's mother-in-law's mother-in-law's mother-in-law's
Another commented: "Comprehensively traumatic both for the mother and for the baby.
"But why don't they use a milk pump for mothers who take care of their babies?"
Another said, "It's such a disgusting story."
Others defended the ad, while a mother admitted that she found the song "immeasurably funny."
"I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought one if I were still stealing.
I felt as if I was in a cold place.
It's a bit insane, but I understand it as it should be.
"This is a brilliant product," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement that targets moms who are pumping off (often at work or the toilets) and feel like 'cooking'.
This is not an advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pumps placed in their souties.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who pump off milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pompom is very unobtrusive, has no drums or slings and fits discreetly into a stylized salt and thus offers women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner in ECD at "Mother," commented: "Elvie's pottery is a revolutionary product that deserves a keen and provocative introduction.
By drawing a parallel, between pumping down mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the pumping down of milk and the associated challenges and at the same time demonstrate in an entertaining and greasy manner.
This isn't the first time Elvis has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mother for designer Marta Jakubowski ran across the catwalk while wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were silenced in a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of imprisoned migrant children has reached a peak, although the alleged border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the sharp rhetoric of the Trump administration and the guidelines imposed by them have made it difficult to bring children under sponsorship.
Traditionally, most sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared to stay in the country, to put on the game by signing up to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June when federal agencies announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their state would have to hand over fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, timed before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of children from people who claimed to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested previously had not been punished.
"Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
"We're going to go after those people," said the Lord Albence.
In attempting to work out the children more quickly, officials, according to subcontractors, introduced new rules, by which some of them had to appear before the court within a month after the arrest, instead of after 60 days (the previous standard).
Many appear to be using video conferencing instead of personal in order to advance their case for a legal status of an immigration court.
Those who do not qualify for help will be expelled quickly.
As children remain in custody for longer, they are more likely to become anxious and depressed, which, according to subcontractors and reports made known in recent months from the system, can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape.
Lawyers have indicated that these concerns are still being exacerbated in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that the signs due to the size of the facility will be overlooked that a child is struggling with it.
They added that providing children in the tent city without sufficient time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could worsen the trauma they are struggling with.
Syria demands that the U.S., France and Turkey withdraw their "occupation" immediately
Before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, although the war in the country had already lasted eight years.
Al-Moualem, who is also the vice-premier, said that the foreign forces, using the pretext of combating terrorism, illegally stay on Syrian soil and are "compliant with them."
"We need to be ready and ready," he said to the audience.
Al-Mualem has insisted that the "war on terrorism in Syria is as good as it is over," where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have lost their homes.
He said that Damascus's "holy struggle continues until we have cleansed all Syrian areas" both from terrorist groups as well as "illegal foreign presences."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, training and advising mainly Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, al-Moualem said the conditions for them to return were in line and he has accused "some Western countries of spreading irrational fears" that have urged refugees to stay away.
"We have worked with the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should actually be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no build-up aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for a buffer zone in the last major rebel-held Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
Al-Moualem, however, insisted that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and he expressed the hope that the military action would take jihadists, including fighters of the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, into the viewpoint, which "will be erased."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members will soon come together to draft an emergency constitution for Syria and establish the way for elections.
Al-Moualem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the Council should be restricted to "revise the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump won a second term in office
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020, unless how many liberal viewers are likely to hope a resignation or a scandal would pre-empt his presidency.
"The most dramatic end of a presidency that ever happened!"
So far, however, there has been no sign of inconvenience on the part of the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's top broadcasting ratings have doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million mainstream viewers, while four years ago it was still 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" peaked the cable rating with no less than 3.5 million viewers on mainstream nights.
"This is a celebration that unnerves people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, serial director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a popular comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
He had a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
Chauffeur told him he would vote for the Lord Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
He replied, "Because he's making me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's a chaos in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, actions from the White House could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigration families will reunite and determine the health of the global economy.
Ignoring this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And by the way, it surpasses the understanding of an informed citizen, when one catches himself full of six hours' worth of Washington's attention, and watches a panel discussion of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background," which represents the source for his book "Fear" - Paul Manafort's $5,000 quote.
For example, I'll never see Super Mario again with the same eyes as before.
"Part of what he's doing is letting it feel like a reality show that he does something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director-general of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about Trump's show with rotating cast and day-to-day unexpected conspiracies.
You can't make a mistake, otherwise you won't be able to.

It's not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is seeing a cash flow, thanks to the reorganization of the congressional districts that two officials won in a race around the same seat.
This newly established suburb of Pittsburg is to the detriment of Democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in a sunny election last spring in another district.
The Lamb joins against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is snowing over with the new 17th.
The cards were re-signed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been tampered with in favor of Republicans.
The race around the new 17th kicked off an exchange for campaign funding between the main funding arm, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb has become a well-known name for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania after a scarce victory in a much-observed solar balloon in March.
The seat was held for over a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points ahead.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight lead.
The U.S. has decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but has refrained from doing so.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without great resistance from the United States.
Mr. Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the administration team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall the American leaders of their diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan," said Header Nauert, spokeswoman for the ministry in a statement at the beginning of the month.
However, only sanctions were taken against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid, including for drug controls, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which cut financial aid payments and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, the functionaries of North and Central America diverted a high-level conference with an emphasis on security and economic prosperity to join a similar meeting last year, which was taken as a step forward in efforts to settle migrants on and down the road.
But in mid-September, leading functionaries made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place ahead of time and thus effectively paused all considerations for sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence must now set to host the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a signal for the imports that the administration is setting for the meetings, the diplomats said.
And the three American singers returned very quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any newly-released news or penalties from Washington.
A representative speaker of the White House to Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate, which was made by the three American Hussains, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who worked closely with the administration and who also spoke about the conditions of anonymity.
The History of Learning
Your next job message could be special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible legal impediment, about which there is now considerable evidence in the public files.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, wants to find out with his inquiry on the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia to attack our elections has also been co-opted.
If Congress is to be re-assembled, then Mr. Trump will have to show responsibility for the new assembly, shortly before he has to show himself the electorate again, and perhaps even a jury of his colleagues.
That's a lot of conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's demise is inevitable - or that of his European equivalents.
We all have to make decisions on the two sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the length of this dispute.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and have not taken the opportunity to prevent the years of massacres that have resulted.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's ruthless march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing some of these turning points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who is steering the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year that he secretly admitted the president and speculated that he is not for his post.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' report is flawed.
"What will our response be if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is sworn in to the Supreme Court, even if there are credible accusations of sexual excess and dishonest charges against him?
And, above all, are we going to elect in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Trump responsible?
If we don't do this, we're going to have a bad time with democracy.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew belonging to the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial homeland and was deported to Auschwitz.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, she sent me off to start Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika afterwards.
With that in my legacy, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna fight
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna a Thursday is aware that the victory against the Austrians, having initially played impressively this month in Spain against Villarreal, put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season since the 2-2 match with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a leap forward to achieve better things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we got something and they went home with a point.
Maybe we'll end up with a bit of a hiccup, but on the whole, a game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were in the second half the better side.
It's a big European night again.
Hopefully we can get three points but that will be a difficult match because they had a good result in their last match but, with the spectators on our side, I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result.
It's been a long time since I've had a lot of injuries and injuries in the club itself, but it's been a lot of work.
The squad is good and the boys have a lot of fun; the training is good.
Hopefully, we will be able to get ahead and be successful in the last season."
Women can't sleep because of their fears of loss of life.
Even though the participants of the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be supplied, few people spoke to members of their family about it.
About half of the individuals in this nationwide study said they were going to talk to their partner about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want to be taken care of by a member of their family, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
That's how one starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to care for you if you don't make your wishes known early enough.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get support, as the choices play an important role in calculating the costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your consultant can also help to find a way to pay the costs.
Your choices to pay for your long-term care include a traditional insurance for long-term care, a hybrid cash life insurance to help cover the costs or a self-insurance with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Take a look at your legal documents: Conflicts of Law
Establish a health insurance proxy so that a person trusts your expensive door to oversee your health care and can ensure that professionals follow your wishes in the event that they are unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You're going to choose a person you trust to make your financial decisions and make sure that the bills are paid if you're unable to.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly parent would have a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.

A man was shot with an airstrike in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with an air rifle while on the way home when he was out at night.
The victim, in the 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the abdomen and in the hand.
The gunman described the shooting, which occurred at 2:30 BST, as a "accidental act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
They don't want to be killed, and the police don't want to be killed.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died during a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian state of Palu, so the households, with the expectation that the number of dead will continue to rise.
Because the communication opportunities have collapsed, the official aid could not get a chance to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, a region in the north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which is at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was about to celebrate its 40th birthday when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over more than 300km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative region under the province, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morawali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala were often hit by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the information of the Indonesian Disaster Deterrence Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggalamei killed 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is suffering from seismic fires and is being hit regularly by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of last year:
2004: A major bend on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong bends hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 force hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 strong bend struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 strong bend hit one of the Menawai Islands, near Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An overwhelming protest hit the Jaya Regency in Aceh, sparking destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly protest and tsunami.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed in the tsunami.
2018: Indonesian tourists hit Lombok Island and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The site destroyed thousands of buildings and locked up thousands of tourists temporarily on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaksa and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was released for soupçon of domestic violence, allegation of a report of domestic violence, and for resistance to a detention, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to convict the suspects, he took him off the phone.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured debt of $500, KTUU reported.
He was in a courtroom, where he declared that a "certainty is not guilty," as was requested after the confession of guilt, the broadcaster said.
Palin faces three Class-A offences, which means he could be jailed for one year and face a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offense, punishable with a roof in prison and a fine of $2000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the suspected attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, allegation of a report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon while intoxicated and associated with the incident.
His friend claimed that he had slapped his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups in 2016 for seeing her son's violent behavior and connection with PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-strong earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks are out and it is expected that the number of dead will increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck a little further away from the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as the tsunami hit the shores.
Federal prosecutors want to suspect rare death penalty for NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare penalty that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a leaned home depot truck to carry out the attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, and had pedestrians and cyclists who were overrun in his way in October.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors had to prove that Saipov "wanted" to kill eight people and "wanted" to cause serious physical damage, according to the letter of intent to demand the death penalty, issued by the Southern District of New York.
The two charges could lead to a possible death penalty, according to a court case.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury sued Saipov's indictment of 22 charges, which included eight murder charges in support of protectionist extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack needed "substantial planning and forethought," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "cruel, terrible and perishable."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has suffered injuries, pain, and loss to relatives and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan DIego Mendoza and Damian Pagnucco," said the statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since she has pursued the Southern District of New York for the last time a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union for two years earlier during the Cold War.
The two Rose Mountains were killed on June 19, 1953 at the Electric Chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court files.
He told the police that he was doing well because of what he had done.
Saipov told the agencies that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the accusation.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung up in his hospital room, police said.
He was not charged with 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal duty defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"We think that the decision to envisage the death penalty, instead of a confession of guilt and a life in prison without the possibility of being released, will prolong the trauma of these events for everyone," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked not to envisage the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has sworn during a protest at a Tory conference that he will "mobilize the people's army."
The former UKIP leader said the politicians had to "muscle the heat" of the Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbone Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be "out" if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the challenge made by Madam May to bring the deeply separate ranks back together has been dubbed by pro-remaining tories who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has problems to track their checkers' compromise plan around the attacks of Brexiteers, remaining in the EU.
Allies have insisted that it should continue to fight to get a deal with Brussels, despite the backlash – and should force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose either its package or ‘chaos’.
Lord Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he was going to exit the Chequers."
He suggested that the Lord should have given Farage a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he's gone, we'd be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I stand up for Brexit but we have to get rid of the checkers."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subjected.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone has suggested that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: the idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to remain is completely wrong."
Andrea Jenkyns, the storyteller of Brexit, was also on the march, and the journalists said: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who really go through the streets and lead us to be elected at all.
When I'm ready, I'm going to start listening."
In a closed message to Madam May, it added: "The premieres will keep their job if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that the politicians had to "feel the heat" if they opposed the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a trust between the ice - the people - in our political class," he said.
"They're trying to go back to Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we're not letting you get away with it.'"
In a message to an enthusiastic public, he added: "I think that our political class, which has recently been behind Brexit, is letting the heat shine.
"We are mobilizing the people's armies of this country who have given us the victory with Brexit and will soon cease to exist until we are an independent, self-governing, proudly united kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A small group of activists have been around after the group's founding this weekend's Tories Against Brexit banners.
Labour peer Lord Adonis has been mad with the Conservatives because of the security issues they had with a party app when the conference began.
"These are the people who tell us that they know how to install the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
The presidential candidates are expected to be "serious" to become presidential candidates.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said it was "serious to become a presidential candidate" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke to the Samsden about their future during a speech at the stadium in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against GOP State Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It was the center of speculation that was uncontested against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday morning event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the electorate in the Stadhal format since Trump took his post.
One of the candidates asked for a presidential nominee.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to flee our futile government, and that also means that a woman must be at the top."
It came to a close after a deadly shooting of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, have announced a Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in relation to the deadly shooting against basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET Press Conference.
They released a video of the shooting and asked for help to identify the man seen in the video.
The Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"The Wayde Sims suffered a shot in the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to help his colleague and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was asked and admitted that he was on the scene, with a gun, and admitted that he shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a 6.6ft junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, last season played 32 matches with 10 starts and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is more likely to win the world championship after winning Sebastian Vettel.
It is clear that Mercedes' team success will play a major role in the race as Valtteri Bottas qualified the Saturday before Lewis Hamilton.
From the pole, Bottas got a good start and almost took Hamilton out while defending his position in the first two tiers and inviting Vettel to attack his players.
Vettel went first in the pits and led Hamilton to drive the traffic at the end of the pack, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes drove into the pits a tour afterwards and was behind the Vettel as he came out, but Hamilton became the first after a wheel-to-wheel action, as the Ferrari driver inadvertently had to release the band and still risked to defend the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first tour on his 21st birthday.
He was then the first for a majority of the course while holding his tires for a tough finish and to take Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
He ended up on the 44th tour and drove the pits but he was not able to raise his rhythm in the last eight tier yet, while the Raikkonen won the fourth place.
It's a tough roof because Valtteri had a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me pass by.
The team read such an exceptional job to have one two, Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made a Saturday at a rally cheating on Senator Dianne Feinstein because he insisted that he had not leaked Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are "wicked and dishonest and dishonest."
"The only thing that could happen and what was beautiful during the last few days in the Senate was when one saw the riot, when one saw the rose and the evil and the dishonest and the dishonest," he said.
"When someone sees what is made public and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer... you leaked the document - 2oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no. [chuckles]
I haven't leaked.
Hey, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't," he added, as he responded to the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with details about the allegations against Ford's Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein argued that the leak was known from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as it asked."
But his allegation did not come well with the president, who during the rally commented on a Saturday: "I tell you, that was very bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president, who continued to nominate his defense of the Supreme Court, who was accused by three women of sexual misconduct, suggested that Democrats would oppose the claims for their own purposes.
"They want to get back the power with all the tools that are needed.
It sees the evil, the equality, it doesn't matter who they are doing what they do, how they have to override to gain power and control," reports Mediaite as what the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars improved for the loss in the Elite League the free against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 at Dundee a Saturday.
The giants were early ahead with two goals by strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie broke up the home team before the giants were back due to Dwyer.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen Goaler secured the victory.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on a Friday evening.
There was a fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, and the giants won the three games before.
Dwyer's opening was in the fourth minute at 3:35 by a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford giving the assist while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a charged initial period, Sullivan returned the home side at 13:10 to the game before Matt Marquardt scored Cownie's balance at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the giants would be with a lead and the first break when he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard brought them back to an equal level with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure they won with his team in their fifth and half of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next match.
In the meantime, it's safe to say that hundreds of people can flee from an earthquake on the airplane.
A flight pilot in Indonesia is recognized as a hero after he died while trying to make sure that a plane with hundreds of people gets safely off the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many more are still missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
There are a lot of people in the area and a lot of people are trapped in the streets of the city.
But although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in wildly shaky control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He remained to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the slope, could safely flee.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower as he thought he was going to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision was likely to save hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
Sea prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a large hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him before reaching the Palu helicopter.
"It breaks our hearts when we hear it," he said.
Meanwhile, agencies feared that the number of dead could go up to thousands, while the country's disaster deterrence agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"It is expected that the number will continue to shine, because many bodies are still lying under the trunk while others cannot be reached," said the agency's spokesman, Sutop Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that were up to 6 meters high destroyed Palu, where a sun is held a mass burial.
The military and transport aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute brings an ambulance bodies.
The water is scarce.
"Mini-markets are plagued everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is making rapid efforts to help the survivors, but we don't know what we will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could be a lot worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military of the country: "I pray you all to work night and day to complete your tasks in the context of the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was first hit this year by an earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crashed: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that carried out a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia has now said that one man has disappeared, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers in the crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was about to sink.
Air Niugini said in a public statement that they could not stand up for a male passenger since Saturday night.
The flight company said they work with local agencies, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane landed on water as it was attempted to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The police said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers would still be in hospital, and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact outcome of the accident remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane had landed in the lagoon, not far from the slope.
There were some people who thought that the plane had gone down the slope.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had been attacked by thieves.
"That's an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others had made it through the water, which went to the hips, to the safety exits on the plane that was going down with it, to wade
He said the stewardess panicked and yelled that he had suffered a small wound in the head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked closely to improve a shipyard also helped in the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people ashore before the plane submerged in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the air safety network indicated that in the last two decades 111 people died in accidents of PNG-registered airlines, but none of them were in relation to Air Niugini.
Analyst retraces the time span of the night and animal a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution ended Saturday's explanation of her case in a second investigation into a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has long been an expert in intelligence analysis.
He retraced for the jury how a cell phone data used to coexist with 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night it died.
Rowlett said he received location data from many mobile phone operators who showed that Tellis was with Chambers at night of his death, contradicting his statements of one, The Clarion Ledger reports.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sandford.
Sandford made a statement, claiming that the roof was not in the city.
When investigators asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sandford's truck that night, Sandford said he was going "lean because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconvenience was that Tellis said that he had known the Chambers since he died about two weeks ago.
The phones showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after a while after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and contact information from the Chambers' mobile phone.
"He's gone out of his life," said Hale.
It is expected that the defense of a sun will begin to give its last arguments.
The judge said he expected the trial to take me to the jury.
The High Breed: What is the meaning of Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive message.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claim that the hip hop has gone from its origins of political messages to the solution of social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and love conscious hip hop again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently regained popularity in the UK due to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
After a black one?!
New York City's New York Times has been accused of "short-term" sexual assault on a "short-term"
A New York baby girl accuses a couple of discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrectly addressed text message from the mother, who complained that it was "after a black."
The couple denies that they are racist, and compares the plaintiffs with "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed horror when it found out that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when it arrived for its first day of work in 2016.
"After a blackout," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But, instead of sending it to his husband, he sent it to Madame Maurice, two times.
After noticing the Fauxpas, a "unpleasant" Plasco Flaxman dismissed Madame Maurice, explaining that the nanny had just gone, an African-American, had done poor work and that instead of a Filipino, it would have been expected, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and was sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice is accusing the couple of getting a compensation from the dismissal, and expects a compensation of about $350 per day for the job of 6 months for which it would have lived in the house for which it was initially hired, but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, something like that doesn't happen," said a freeman in the post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rebuffed allegations that they were racist, saying it was the sensible decision to cancel Maurice's position, fearing that they could not trust him after they insulted it.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
There is no racism.
We are not racist people," said the man, Joel Plasco, in the post.
Is there a way for your children to get into the hands of someone with whom they have been abused, even if it's a madness?
Your newborn baby?
Dajee."
Plasco said, comparing the complaint to "extortion," that his wife had only had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
Is there a way to get rid of such a person?
This is not a good way to trade," added the investment banker.
While the court case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social media, tearing them for their behavior and logic.
The Paddington dispatchers feared that the readers could not relate to a beer that spoke, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to get into the mood of someone who celebrates reading it first before it's published.
"It's very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington's success."
It said that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by one of a small teddy bear to write the children's book, would have been rose, if his work had not been accepted, and added that the 60th birthday of the books would be "battery sweet" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who describes it as a "very important family member," it says that his father was quietly proud of his later success.
"He was a very rude man, and he was not a person who bragged," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was a bit like a child would have achieved something: it's someone who is really proud of them even if it's not one's own creation.
I think he saw a little bit of Paddington's success in that direction.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was about to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, his daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur's 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save his life without success.
"The Nad has often called to say that it looks very bad, that it is not expected that it will pack," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I was called by Nad to say that it was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say adieu.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'm on it.
I'm going to make sense.
The drugs that the doctors gave him to keep his heart at bay slowly and slowly relapsed and left his system.
It was a short time ago, and that was just the end.
I just sit there and wait, knowing that all this is happening.
I couldn't scream or scream or scream because I was in a situation with family and people.
I'm really going to get raped."
Finally, Madam Ednan-Laperouse, moment in mourning for the loss of her daughter, had to get into the plane with the other passengers – without knowing what she had to go through.
"Nobody knew anything," he said.
"I've kept my head down, and the tears have always fallen.
It's hard to explain, but I saved a huge amount of sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved.
Women and Grief Send Cards to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide worked to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent maps with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support, along with a Welsh bridge.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm feeling," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cake with an inflammatory smile.
"Everyone knew it because of his grin.
They've always said that they're going to get their hands on it no matter what."
But he left his job before he died because he was "in a dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his sibling after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that this will have consequences."
Mrs. Davis made the cards, "to notify the people that there are people outside who can go to one and talk to one, even if it's a friend.
Just sit down, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after her mother's death.
He didn't say that he was feeling bad or depressed or that he was going to feel bad," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we realized that there was something different going on.
On Christmas Day, he was at the end - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
It said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to become one with it: "It raps a laugh through the whole family.
It's ripping us off.
We all have to fight and fight.

Kavanaugh's future hangs in an unstable balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could really get something like what he asked for - a time-limited investigation, with limited scope - then maybe we could achieve a bit of unity," said Lord Flake Saturday, adding that he would be afraid that the committee would be "outnumbered and outnumbered."
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The time has come for them to be completely overwhelmed.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans get poor results, then they will be heavily weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush took the phone and called on the senators to lobby them to support her Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces its report?
There will be an election in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 elections in the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to pass an equality and swear an indictment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's survivors 'fall' under Kim
The number of survivors from North Korea and South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the Union Ministry in the south, saying that there were 1,127 survivors last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China at the expense of human smugglers played a major role.
Pyongyang has not made any comments.
The majority of the survivors from the North will eventually be offered South Korean state sovereignty.
Seoul says that since the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the survivors more like illegal migrants than as refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
The relations between North and South Korea – which are still technically war-torn – have improved sharply in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks about the halted denuclearization negotiations.
This is after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agree that they should work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has imposed sanctions on the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no self-confidence in our national security and under these conditions it will be impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally for the first time," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court in his temperament.
Pelosi gave the comments of Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like that, she would be saying "hysterically,"" Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a thunderstorm.
Kavanaugh has claimed that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as they were both emotionally disagreeing.
During his introductory statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, partly yelling or swallowing while talking to his family during his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a "gross and coordinated call-murder campaign" organized by liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed that Kavanaugh's statements proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it shows that he voted against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements in the way he ran against the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi expressed concerns as it was asked whether it was going to try to accuse Kavanaugh if a sworn-in was made, and whether the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm just saying that here - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only not fit to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in court where he's at right now," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is regarded as conservative justice.
In his ruling, Kavanaugh's questions about the possibility that he might be violating certain decisions of the Supreme Court have gone out of his way.
"It's not the time to take a hysterical, biased person to court and then expect us to say 'this isn't wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And the woman has to do it.
It's a fair rage, months and years of anger that has overwhelmed, and hasn't gotten out without crying.
"We're going to cry when we're going to rose," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, don't you?"
She continues, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a guiding force somewhere, where she said that she would also cry when she rose, but that she developed a technique, which means that when she rose and began to cry, she would then cry to the person with whom she spoke, "I will cry because I will speak to you," she said.
I'm a rose."
And then it just went on.
I thought it would be brilliant."
Tears are partially allowed as a valve for anger because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my harshest memories of a former job, in a mostly male office where I screamed with indescribable anger, was that an elderly woman took me on the collar – a bare manager I was always afraid of – and pulled me into a trap.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know that the rose is.
"You're going to be sad and happy that you're going to be happy."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extraordinary affair on a boat called Monkey Business and went out of the race, Madame Schroeder, with great frustration, thought that it should not continue to think about the idea of becoming a presidential candidate for herself.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
He called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was already late in the campaign, it was behind with the donation collection, so it swore that it would not go into the course unless it collected $2 million.
It was a battle that was lost.
He found out that some of his supporters, who gave men $1000, only gave him $250.
"Am I going to get a refund?" he asked.
As it held its speeches and announced that it was not launching a formal campaign against it, it was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who had gone to support, frustration with the system that makes it so difficult to raise money and for voters and not delegates to blame – and anger against that sex.
"Someone might think I've had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled her reaction to the press.
"I was told that the company was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what I was going to write on my grave.
"Have you screamed?"
The U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing.
The first salves of the trade war between the United States and China have hit one, and even if the struggle is not over for a long time, a break between the countries could be long-term beneficial for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warnings at the beginning of this year by spending an important Chinese exporter, such as solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new tariffs hitting objects worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), so that in the end half of the funds coming from China to the US were spent.
Beijing has retracted every time, setting recent tariffs at five to ten percent on U.S. dollars worth $60 billion.
China has vowed that it will join the shot-by-shot of the United States, and the world's second-largest economy will not push it in as quickly.
If they wanted to get Washington to stop, they would have to go on demands, but publicly making themselves small before the US would be too big a embarrassment for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right decisions, it could positively support the U.S. pressure in China's trade war in the long run as it slows down the interconnection of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could trigger an economic swirl in the two countries is ultimately much more dangerous than the spectators have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, a scientific employee at the Think Asia New Tank Center.
Syria is 'prepared' for refugees returning, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it will be ready for those who want to return and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All the conditions have now been met so that those refugees who want to return to the country and the poor refugees due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their everyday lives and their living conditions can return.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are more than six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they did not accept any contingent aid or assistance from countries sponsored by the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup as they defeated the Team USA with a result of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown as the Danish captain's team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had the majority of the tournament's problems, shot his tea shot into the water at par-3 of the 16th laugh, thus losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was excellent in all his rounds, and has become one of four players who have ever had a 5-0-0 since the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with 5&4 of the worst player on the rankings of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best-placed player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 against England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has become the European with the most victories of all time at 25.5 as the career point of the tournament.
"I don't normally cry today, I can't do anything else.
It was a hard year.
I am so thankful to Thomas that he took me along and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
"I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He becomes the torch to his landskoleeg, John Ram, who defeated US legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles game a Sunday.
"The tremendous pride I feel in defeating Tiger Woods, I watched him grow up," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games to France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A weird statistic for one of the best players of all time, winning 14 major titles as second after Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team had trouble finding fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the entire tournament over golf at a high level.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
There were moments in the mornings when we showed Europe our fire.
We've been fighting.
The chapel for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll get together again, I'll talk to the PGA of America in our Ryder Cup committee and we'll continue.
I love the 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You've got to take one out.
We've been overrun."
