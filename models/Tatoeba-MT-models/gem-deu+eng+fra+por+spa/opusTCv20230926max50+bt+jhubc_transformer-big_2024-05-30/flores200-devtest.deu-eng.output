USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the Olympic Committee of the United States and accepts it as an absolute necessity that the Olympic family is committed to a safe environment for all our athletes.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal on the top were chestnut brown and on the bottom were light or carotenoid colored.
The finding also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called Rachis, but have other feathers features – rear hooks and barbules – the researchers concluded that the Rachis was probably a later evolutionary evolution than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used to fly, but rather to regulate temperature or to control the heart. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the feathers of an adult rather than the downs of a chick.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not chicken down.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at the police headquarters of Turkish Gaziantep, killing two police officers and wounding over twenty more people.

They have found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: it has been found that the activity of all the stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
In order to determine the Rossby number of a star associated with the plasma current, the luminosity and rotation are taken together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of circumpolations of the magnetic field.

The work was largely theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

Extreme drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
"In an interview, he said the new variant was 'extremely disturbing and alarming due to the very high mortality rate.'"
Some patients may have contracted the pathogen in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were medical hospital workers.

Infrared images show temperature differences between night and day, indicating that they are probably caves.
"They are colder in the day than the surrounding surface and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as the large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the soil," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin and put a pre-printed sheet of paper on which the candidate of their choice is registered in an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there are no envelopes at the start of the election and that no envelopes are thrown in, except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

Her other race, the giant slalom, finished in 10th place in the women’s group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, making her 2:11.60 minutes slower than first-place Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who took ninth place.
Four female skiers from cruising did not reach the finish line, and 45 of the 117 female skiers in the giant slalom were unable to place themselves in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and secured their phone and laptop.”
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car rushed in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked, while the rescue services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was charged with the murder of her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She is in custody until prosecution and trial, but eyewitness testimony could be falsified as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee remarks: “Journalists seem to cross a dangerous border when they post photos, etc. of suspects.”
The Crown Office, which is in charge of prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians are demanding a reset of borders to the state before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other issues allegedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, but the Palestinian Authority only wants to accept such a presence for five years.
The guards of the accompanying attempt to contain the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the attempt was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Managing Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training lessons.
Martelly has sworn in a new Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is Martelly’s fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The partly violent protests were triggered by the non-execution of elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
More than 60 cases of overheating have been reported in defective iPods, triggering six fires in total, and four people have suffered mild burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economic Affairs, Commerce and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
“Last week, METI announced that it had been notified by Apple of 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company described as ‘not serious.’”
The ministry responded by describing Apple’s report as “really regrettable.”
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Civil Protection Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He trained as a maternity doctor and began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work at the hospital, Liggins began in his spare time to investigate premature labor.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that the government's investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, ""Luna was the first queen of the extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."""
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as crazy as I was ... maybe even more crazy ... I love her and will miss her ... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal elections, the proportion of those who oppose Australia’s becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympic Games was supposed to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle disciplines and in three team squads at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned due to his many complaints.
He was unable to take the medications needed to overcome his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supply to the Earth, along with organic matter that can make proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists promise themselves insights into how planets, especially the Earth, emerge.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as “political gossip and foolishness.”
It is speculated that he could apply for the office of president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground radar to enable air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional means of transport will be set up and the above-ground trains will not stop in Wembley. No parking or park-and-ride facilities are available on site.
With concerns about the lack of transport facilities, the probability that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team increased.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the emergence of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved within just two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process took much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza forte, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a variety of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to a thin wire that can be turned and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called picture manuscripts, in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the PH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been extracted (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird and forms a kind of protective layer.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a sink toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets, and in Roman culture toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that visited men and women in mixed society.
If you’re calling someone thousands of miles away, you’re using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
Scientists are using telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It takes a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The biggest service the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat prey medium-sized animals, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are still many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat far smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that every cat has and which ensures that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called packs.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to the lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior and are just as lethal to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not particularly well), swim, jump large distances and pull with the five-fold strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roaring of the tiger does not sound like the full-bodied roaring of the lion, but rather like a sentence of grunting, roaring words.
Ozelots eat small animals. If they can, they capture monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than himself.
Scientists think that Ozelotes are tracking and tracking animals to eat (prey) with their sense of smell. They are sniffing at where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ozelots chase their prey by visually aligning with their surroundings and then plunge onto their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (e.g., when they move across a mountain range or river, or when they relocate to a new island, so they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population needs different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, and it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food via the sun through photosynthesis and provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. We mainly feed on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaur was the greatest predator of his time, so he feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, meaning there was no escape for any animal crossing his path.
We don’t know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other mosaics, and maybe even a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not fit for him.
While most of their food may be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called seven-sleeper.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to hold banquets together, where they lay on their sides while they ate their meals.
Ancient Rome dishes could not contain foods that came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they had neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of God.
They offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to conform to the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, homes were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops were simply open to the street shop counters. Stone was used for building the house.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Old Norse legends say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. When he travelled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie “The Legacy of the Templars,” you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776"; the text is head-on at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches x 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of his life.
So it is possible that the note was simply added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"He was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge across multiple generations, a sustained cultural footprint and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and failing to be recognized as real civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 federal states first formed a weak central government based on the federal treaty, which consisted only of Congress.
Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, in enforcing all of its laws, it relied on the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate.
He also had no authority to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so seriously that its representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful in the world and was FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motorsports.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands Japan became, Japan is geographically often referred to as "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors drove past it and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a change in the cereal cultivation methods of the indigenous people and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions, declaring Taiwan province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
Until 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world’s most widespread still image format is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its image format has been taken over from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35 mm format confusingly measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much reviled and often ridiculed third-party rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a level of order in an image.
It states that the crossing point of the lines that form an image vertically and horizontally thirds is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had held the European states together in spite of different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the churches exist for this very reason.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being met.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective as it cut off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating entire sections of the sea, which posed a threat even to neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the predominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to join the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different ages. Every span of time in China and every family in power was a dynasty of its own.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which took place between the Han and Jin dynasties for 60 years.
During these times fierce wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Age of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and the best could excel.
The same goes for the military, because instead of class membership, the army rankings were now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life, and he often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Only" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a vivid picture of Mohammed’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s not easy to find, even if you know it exists, and once you’re in the cave, you’re completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built in the third century BC by the Egyptians, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to worship deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops’ wives and family members.
The "slash" symbol looks like a V and the "slash" symbol looks like a bracket or a square where the lower line is missing.
Upward means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Downward means that you start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Striking usually generates a softer sound, while striking is stronger and more expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; however, remember that the printed sheet markings are there for musical reasons, which is why they should normally be respected.
The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris on 6 October 1789 in Versailles by a mob of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming crowd of people threatening the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the upset crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of the US imperialists in conquering the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of spending, and interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that resulted from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which coincidentally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general notions: on the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and, on the other hand, that technology, in turn, has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than social.
One can say, for example, that the passenger car inevitably entails the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is economically unsustainable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread car ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures related to this geography emerged and these, since they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined over the course of the twelfth century, mainly due to the crusaders returning with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offer of Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also migrated from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, the styles in the West are lagging 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that, as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to fix clothes.
Demand economy is agriculture, which aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, cultivation that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion and combines with alternate farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers operated a subsistence economy, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called ""wild"" or wild. Some wild children were held captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child's neglect was due to the inability of the parents to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations."
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or had traumatic experiences before they were exposed or ran away.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When fully reared by animals, the wild child displays behaviors (within the limits of his physical abilities) that are almost entirely in line with those of his specific foster animal, such as his fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that supports individuals in a novel learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or when starting a new project.
In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the small paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is designed to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle alone.
Children are housed in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving, and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care system is a piece of security for these children.
Our nursing family system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The nursing home should cover all the needs they did not receive in the home from which they were previously taken out.
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "sustained relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience responses on websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, a few milliseconds of facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can see if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article The President’s Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who can no longer understand language because of brain damage can still correctly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation provides for new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
Moreover, omitting it has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only readily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which all contain essential amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way as the chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposeful awakening during normal sleep periods and falling asleep briefly (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you are someone who introduces the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of fluid before bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
The level of inner calm that a person possesses correlates in reverse with the level of tension in body and mind.
The less the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can gain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been extended to include the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the Gods Yoga, which through the visualization of various deities cleanses the energy channels, opens the chakras and creates the enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the end of the war, the clashes between the systems, the course and the culture caused the countries to be hostile.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It should last for the next 40 years and in reality be deployed by deputy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed completely and the only hope was a retreat and a repositioning along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them after they invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy was traditionally to ensure that a country remains able to transport people and goods, while at the same time hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring workforce and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly by submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Z<0xC4><0x81>gros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as farm animals to easily get to their milk, fur, meat and skin.
House goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures. The goats were cared for by goat herders, quite similar to the more well-known sheep herders; often they were children or adolescent ones. These grazing methods are still used today.
Already in the 16th century, subsidiary tracks were built in England.
Although the conveyor tracks consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early to secure the position of the rails, but gradually the realization that rails that carry a band of iron are more efficient began to prevail.
This became commonplace, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning "right man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not go upright as regularly.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to ease future suffering a little.
In many cases, this is merely a symptomatic treatment, but if you do not want only temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of people.
After his adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given to John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap wide pages that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists nowadays believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or as bits to use the computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so widespread that it is not possible to make a diagnosis immediately.
The best sign of ingesting poisoning can be the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing people.
Both predatory bugs and bed bugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or the housing of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease in adults younger and middle-aged.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over parenting.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works with the help of the scientific method. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific research.
However, it is not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test that serves to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and conducting observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in the Latin language.
Aristotle's views on all science issues including psychology were acknowledged.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often essentially based on the presence of the body's own cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Certain behaviors of a cycle, which are not only reactions to signs of external cycles, are known to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-preserving oscillators that perform free oscillating cycles even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the key indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to build their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material in question and whether the cells in question are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to drive to their workplace and are passed by by others whose workplace is at the place they just left.
In this dynamic commute, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on the private car.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has carried human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.x
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similarly many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such malfunctions, why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the two.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave somewhat consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be presented mathematically roughly.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and find more efficient food and sex partners.
Most insects can fold back their wings along their body.
As a result, they have a wider selection of small slips where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and one-day flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the Sun (and even the other stars), is moving around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, since it doesn’t seem like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and most water-rich river in the world, flowing more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, partly up to six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans across the planet’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Empire marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants, it is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, since they can all be found in their original form in nature and can be mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, formulated the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also formulated the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
The universe as a whole is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
Consequently, after its invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has stepped into the background with the advent of newer writing methods, so it has been pushed back in its status and in its use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a sharpener.
You can be curious about what will become of the keyboard when something new comes out.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to compose a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill and splitting the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearby side and 100 km on the distant side.
It is thinner under the mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the close side, there could be more Mary, as the crust is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment make them do or don’t do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow’s theory of need hierarchy and Hertzberg’s two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performing performance assessments, assigning responsibilities, and taking employees into duty.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and makes everything their own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run according to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local management.
The presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is the management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.x"
Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? One goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to address customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must develop a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus delimiting the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
Emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head.
While AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent machine adaptation.
AI research encompasses the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, drawing up strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems.
Today, the AI system is widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and military and has also been installed in numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of any school class, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus ride is not eligible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution: students can view museum pieces from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, Bennet School students in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is rebuilt every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a compilation album.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blog experience, that usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging “also forces students to learn more about the world around them.” The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires students to write wisely and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other people's texts and present their own perspectives on certain topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s enchanting, bilingual capital, and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further to the south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north the unspoilt beauty of nature spreads in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as what is considered to be typical Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, when it comes to wildlife, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Also, wearing a ring is helpful (none that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider assault, and that it is not uncommon to be pursued, to be grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stay consistent when rejecting men, and don’t be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences either way; that doesn’t mean it’s okay!)
Today’s Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinnef are sold, but this is all just for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, every stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to learn about the state of the fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is <0x7E>500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.x
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made Timbuktu a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport, it is nowadays an impoverished city.
In 1990, due to the threat of desert sand, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites.
It was one of the main stations of Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has an Arab rather than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily shelter and admission fees.
It can also be worthwhile to purchase a wild card that grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name given to the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a dazzling bar chart made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.x
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island’s urbanization is densely crowded on newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have made their own, and if you are looking for traces of the area’s colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world, stretching over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that lies within the Indian territory is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stocks of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, one third of which is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengali royal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart throughout the day from the cross-district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between the districts are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses that are cozy and stable.x
Collectible taxis provide a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is an inclined rope bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 m.
The passage height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the approval for traffic was not made until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017 and the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited today's eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also operated subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the Great Province of the West Indies, was formed in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having its polo team and players among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed here at other times of the year.x
Information about competitions and sales points for polo tickets can be found at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is determined in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British Pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and on Stanley credit cards. US Dollars are also widely accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but UK and US currencies can be accepted; ask the owners in advance which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropicals. During the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no pronounced rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the Park Authority, visitors should stay away from at least 100 yards/metre of bears and wolves and 25 yards/metre of all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bisons, wapitis, moose, bears and virtually all the big animals can work, it can happen that they move on to attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Also, be aware that odours can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking highly fragrant foods, and be sure to keep a clean warehouse.
Apia is the capital of Samoa located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 50s of the 18th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of an ignoble navy dump in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland is spread over two ports, there are many beaches, the most popular ones being located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming facilities and most offer shade donated by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be more compatible.
The local tap water can be drunk without hesitation, but if you're worried, you'll also find bottled water easily.
"For Australians, the idea of coffee ""Flat White"" is foreign. A small black one is ""Espresso", cappuccino is stuffed high with cream (not with foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Dice whales occur near the beach and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770 and can occasionally occur outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the assurance that he/she will have a place to stay when he/she arrives at the destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as tent pitches, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also withhold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. visas).
However, any changes or requests should first be made to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to go early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that music is still played on parts of the festival until late at night, even if the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as breaking ice causes quite awful noise for the most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg also provide time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of efforts to keep guests on site for as long as possible and have a lot of money spent. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in the mood and make sure they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages for free, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players are aware of the importance of staying sober.
If you want to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes, you should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing point.
On icy and snowy roads the adhesion is low and you cannot drive as if you were on naked asphalt.
In the case of snowstorms, there can be so much snow that you can get stuck in a very short time.
Visibility can also be affected by falling or wandering snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.x
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues throughout the year for the most part.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in common language refers to a land trip to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can better watch them with binoculars.
A foot safari (also called "bush walk", "walking safari" or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most of the coronavirus cancellation policies did not apply until July 2020, for which the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, an average ticket is about <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing moist clothes can help with drying, and many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not in the room.
If no iron is available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which prove to be more effective in combating certain hazards.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation, or at worst even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are usually not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods that are exempt from duties and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers whose destination country is subject to high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is arguably the biggest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, untapped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp curves prevail here.
The specified speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite tasty. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as well as in southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are widely used, with apples being sold to pastries all year round and cherries and plums being used in summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts, and popular cakes are often particularly good for a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich baked goods, try what is known as Berliner, pancakes or crabs, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without any other attributes, it usually refers to the food that originated from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple-spiced dishes, with the Javanese preferring peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar) and a range of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are aids for the feet of the riders, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider’s feet may be trapped in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and gets caught with his foot on the stirrup, he can be dragged along as the horse goes through. To keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a riser strap to fall off the saddle as soon as it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes along the walls that offer endless possibilities.
Descent sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and descend a slope over a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes also known as "skipenners", who plan their entire holiday around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings with depictions of skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of the ski run as a sport date back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first leisure ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski hiking with backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It resembles alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include this, since the latter are run on steep terrain and require much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you are able to travel slightly longer distances than when hiking – very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-kept trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Normally you would have to apply for multiple visas and passport checks if you wanted to travel through several countries.
However, the Schengen area works a bit like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to pass through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa individually for each of the Schengen member states, saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no general definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques; some tax authorities define over 100-year-old goods as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit can be lower in areas like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be called "antique", although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
Also in the past, not all Sámi have raised large-scale reindeer, but have lived from fishing, hunting and the like. Reindeer kept them mainly as migratory animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Although the term 'Gypsies' is widely used by non-Gypsies, it is often perceived as offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma."
If a travel notice is issued for the country you are going to visit, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than yours, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and too much simplified compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or the loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of it that depend on the geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and wildfires are forms and effects of storms, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterhoses and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly warned to beware of any kind of storm that affects their area, as this can affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that is considered a war zone should take a professional training course for it.
"An internet search for ""course about hostile environments"" will probably show the address of a local company."
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travelers planning a gender-equal operation abroad must ensure that they carry valid identification documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue non-specified gender (X) passports or documents that have been updated to the desired name and gender is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very different.
The search of security checks has also become much more intrusive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals prior to their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact while passing the scanner.
Crack currents are the returning current of waves broken on the beach, often in reefs or the like.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a rapid flow to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are caused by overstrain in attempting to swim back against the current, which can prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won’t be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not so pronounced), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt again to their culture of origin.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and abandoned some behaviors of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers had to adapt in a new country.
It may not be expected that returning travelers will also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it is quiet before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The story of the sounds and the light is just like a story book.
The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the various pyramids illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. 2020 were sixteen active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula bordered by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula here cross into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360-kilometre chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as by expeditions that require data and voice remote connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to that service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is study and course offerings abroad.
This is particularly popular with school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their studies.
In many cases, participating in an overseas bridging year program can actually improve your chances of getting higher education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
For the archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually large enough for each yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, one in six or eight owns a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning in the evening and staying on the ship.
If you only go ashore in the course of on-board excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown or have a traumatic experience behind them.
There is no need to be embarrassed: this is nothing but the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how aircraft operate and how they operate during a flight can help some people overcome the fear associated with the unknown or the feeling of being out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Often time is a very important factor in company documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies, difficulties occurred.
If they ship things via air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines do not allow to send baggage without a passenger, and that is where you come into play.
The obvious method of flying in first or business class is to flip a thick batch of money for the privilege (or, even better, to get your own company to take over the costs).
However, this is not cheap: As a general rule of thumb, you can expect to have to pay up to four times the normal economy rate for the business and eleven times for the first class!
Generally speaking, it’s useless to even look for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of airliners who, for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, are willing to pay a lot of money and demand corresponding prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good traffic hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, advanced and bustling business center located on a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping malls are characterized by classic red tiled roofs, the market from the 18th century, as well as ancient mosques and churches, although the city exudes an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe rather than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons above some graves.
It is worth a half hour to stroll through the fascinating village.
To the north and in the immediate vicinity lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendour in bright colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly via Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Also in the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (Pilgrimage site) – a place that is world famous for its Marien apparitions.
Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave site as well as a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time here, and many others with relatives who were murdered there or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, awe and respect it deserves. Don’t make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not spoil the site by attaching or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only given in Catalan, as it is legally set as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements are made in the metro exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate cliché, the best way to get around Paris is to show oneself at its best and behave like someone who is 'bien élevé', which will make it much easier to get around.
The harsh outward appearance of the Parisians disappears very quickly if you show basic manners.
The Plitwitz Lakes National Park is heavily forested, there are mainly beech, spruce and fir trees, and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and alternating altitudes, it has a remarkably large variety of plant societies.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and eagles as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that extend beyond the knees, and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries, there are wrap-around skirts for women that come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men need to wear pants that reach above the knees.
Also these can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. For all men there is a one size!
Majorcan cuisine, as in similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any right available ingredient such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns start with the word you for ""you"" always with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It may also make reading easier, but writing is rather difficult because you have to determine whether a tune or property word is used as the main word.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to look out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means "love," whereas carro means "carriage of arms."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand formulations.
If you speak a Romance language, it is of course easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a bit of Spanish might soon come to the conclusion that Portuguese is so similar that you don’t have to learn it extra.
Premodern observatories are usually no longer in operation today and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during its peak phase did not represent the problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum flowers represented the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other nobles in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to also remove "only one" specimen."
If you visit a formally designed garden and collect "specimens", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to get around and buy almost anything after arriving.
Since you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to expect both heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to ride goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, castle visits in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the feast were adopted all over the world by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often hold a vigil on Saturday night, during Easter weekend, with the celebrations of the churches often starting at midnight, where the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or swimming.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to embark on the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans entered the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you’ll experience Polar Night, which means the sun won’t rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are among the most common business clothes and colleagues use their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with the focus on group performance rather than praise for individual achievements.
Often, for all decisions they make, workers need to obtain the consent of their superiors and are expected to follow the instructions of their bosses unconditionally.
