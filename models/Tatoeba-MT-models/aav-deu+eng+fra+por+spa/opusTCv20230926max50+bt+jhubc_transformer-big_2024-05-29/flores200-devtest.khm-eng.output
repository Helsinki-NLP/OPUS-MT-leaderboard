Not only does it indicate the general theory that at least some dinosaurs have wings, but it also provides detailed information about the polymers, which are not generally identifiable as colours and dimensional triangles.
Scientists say the animal's hair is brown at the top and yellow at the bottom.
This new study also provides an insight into the evolution of the brain.
Because dinosaur wings don't have good growth and are called rachis, but there are other features of the wings - the hairs and finer hairs - the researchers found that the backs are more likely to evolve later in life when they feature these features.
A wing structure shows that the wings are not for use in flight, but are better for temperature adjustment or for display only. Researchers have shown that although this is the tail of a dinosaur, the sample shows that the wing is an adult and not a chicken wing.
According to the researchers, even though this is a young dinosaur's tail, a sample of adult dinosaurs, it's not a chicken.
