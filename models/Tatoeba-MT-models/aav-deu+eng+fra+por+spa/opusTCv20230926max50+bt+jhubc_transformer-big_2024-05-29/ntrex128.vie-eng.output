Welsh MPs worry about ‘looking like puppets’
There is a certain concern of some members of the National Assembly regarding the change of their titles to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue was raised by plans to change the name of parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Congress at the conference worry that this may be a problem that raises mixed public opinion.
A Labour MP said his party was worried that "the phrase would rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Welsh native readers: In Wales, twp means temporary and pwp means dung.
A Plaid Party delegate pointed out that the whole party was "not proud" and suggested other names.
A Conservative Party delegate said his party had "no bias" about the name change, but did not forget to mention the easy abbreviation MWP for Muppet.
The Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire letter u.
The National Assembly Committee is currently drafting a bill regarding the renaming, stating: "The final decision on any identifiers of the members of the National Assembly will of course be of concern to the delegates themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a referendum on proposals to seek a consensus basis for calling parliament the Welsh Parliament.
Considering the story of the titles of the Members of Parliament, the Committee favored the choice of Members of Parliament of Wales or WMP, but the results of the referendum showed a tendency towards Members of Parliament of Wales.
Members of Congress are openly offering alternative options, but efforts to reach consensus may be of concern to Election Commission Chief Elin Jones, who is tasked with submitting a draft amendment in the coming weeks.
The draft amendment will include other changes to the way parliament operates, including the provisions for dismissal of members of Congress and the design of the government apparatus.
Members of Congress will give a final vote on what they should be renamed when they comment on the draft amendment.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing national name
Voters voted Sunday on whether they would change the country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The comprehensive vote was set in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long asserted that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the opposition party over the rebranding of the country, has vowed to repeal the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the country’s national name is the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church Bells Fall in Silence When Crisis Happens in Harlem
“Historically, the elderly I’ve been exposed to share that every corner of the street has a bar and a church,” Adams said.
“To this day, there is no church and no bar.”
He felt that the disappearance of bars was acceptable.
He said that nowadays "Humans have many ways to communicate."
“Bars are no longer public lounges where people come and go all the time.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not be as sustainable as the leaders expected "and sooner or later it will all be back at the starting line."
He added that these churches could be replaced by condominiums with many condominiums of locals, which would not help in preserving the sanctity of the locality.
He added, “A significant portion of the people who buy apartments in those apartment buildings will be white, and then the prospect of the closure of churches will come faster than ever because there’s no reason for the people in those apartments to become parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a town for people of color - the Metropolitan Community in the 1870s, becoming St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregations moved in the 1930s.
A congregation of black worshippers nearby took over the site.
St. Martin’s was taken over by a black congregation under the stewardship of Father John Howard Johnson, who headed a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a shopping mall street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or urging people of color.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building, but when Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they set it up as a bell.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell "the bell of the poor."
The bell operator in July favored another name: “A cultural treasure” and “an immutable historical treasure.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell ringing in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who pursued the larger bell ringing at Riverside Cathedral 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's would not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin’s over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought up by lay leaders in the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The diocesan administration – the parish’s governing body, which includes lay leaders – referred to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese “will seek to transfer costs” to the diocesan department, although it is not involved in hiring the architects and contractors mentioned.
Some laypeople are unhappy about the lack of transparency on the diocese side.
Sharks attack 13-year-old scuba diving hunting lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while scuba diving in California on Saturday, the first day of the shrimp season, authorities said.
The incident took place before 7 a.m., near Beacon's coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was driving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help and then they all swam out and pulled the boy out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just a delightful scream when he caught the shrimp, but then he "realized that the boy was shouting, 'I got bitten!
I was bitten!”
The whole collarbone of the boy was exposed," Hammel noticed as soon as he reached the boy.
“I told everyone to get out of the water right now: ‘There are sharks there!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by plane to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he was insured, in a critical condition.
The shark was the culprit in the attack, which has not yet been identified.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that they spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but they determined it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to his upper body.
Officials closed beach entrances from the Ponto Sea in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and safety purposes.
Giles reveals that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's strategy to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s is pushing for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with its traditional beauty stalls, which are always assisted by professionals.
As part of a massive push into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which is continuing to grow as sales in the fashion and home appliances sectors decline, larger beauty stalls will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and replicated in more stores next year if there are signs of improvement.
The investment in the beauty industry comes as supermarkets look for ways to take advantage of stalls as alternatives to TV, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it has for the first time doubled the size of its beauty products to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Available brands such as L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have more space and areas selling brand items similar to those displayed in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also reinforcing its Boutique makeup line so that the majority of its products are purely plant-based – something increasingly sought after by younger customers.
Fragrance Shop will test discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first to open in Croydon, south of London, last week and the second to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching to buying small amounts of food every day at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to put more effort into attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said stalls will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to confront Aldi and Lidl’s incentives for more non-food services and items.
Sainsbury’s, which has put Argos stalls in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats stalls since they bought both brands two years ago, has spurred grocery sales and made the acquisition more lucrative.
The supermarket had previously tried to enhance its beauty and pharmaceutical arrays but failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after there was a problem regarding how to divide sales from merchandise stalls in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold 281 of its pharmacy to Celesio, the owner of pharmacy chain Lloyds, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a part in the plan, by strengthening a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our range of beauty products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training for employees who will give advice directly.
Our wide range of brands are designed to suit every need and charming environment as well as convenient locations, which means we are now an attractive stopover, challenging the traditional way to shop.”
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has been “furious” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from her <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal in her stylish brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn’t have time for their Truly furniture and accessories brand.
The couple’s business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning’s 37-year-old host took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den, angering star Peter Jones as she pulled out of their super-profitable styling brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own lucrative new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
In a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources said Jones was “furious” when the show’s golden girl admitted that her new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m – meant she didn’t have enough time to devote to their Truly furniture and accessories brand.
The business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left the UK for one of her lodges.
A source said: "For now, Truly is Holly's top priority.
It should have been her long-term future that could be with her for the next few decades.
Your decision to leave is surprising to everyone involved.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, which is very close to the launch.
There’s a warehouse full of cargo at Marlow headquarters that’s ready to go.”
Experts believe the departure of host This Morning, one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions of dollars by investing heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and furniture, and the ability to backtrack on product launches.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin became close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby formed Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We will not comment on his business.”
It was a great fight, and I loved each other deeply.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider “unruly” for seeing the North Korean leader as positive.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a clone tone of voice, “the host.”
"I'm not giving up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when Trump praised it as a major step forward in denuclearization in North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Ministry chief Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “satisfactory response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing its sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his campaign speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We are going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could be killed.
We are now in a good relationship.”
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results – ending missile tests, freeing hostages and returning the remains of US service members home.
And he defends his unusual approach when it comes to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this cramped area, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia devastate the island and kill hundreds of people
After the disaster from the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has gone missing, no national disaster claims have been made, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very decisive in not asking for international aid, so that’s very challenging,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is rallying a team to move to Palu, they are still unsure whether foreign employees can work in the area.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies are allowed to contribute aid efforts.
Despite the ongoing earthquake situation that Indonesia is experiencing, the country is still not well prepared for the resentment of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, such places are not common in other locations.
Although warnings are effective, the lack of tsunami sirens in Palu has the potential to lead to damage.
At peak times, moving between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
An ambulance train has stayed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims seeking to reach Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia’s aging infrastructure a hub of his election campaign and has squandered money on roads and railways.
But the financial shortage has made it difficult for Joko’s administration as he faces re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from tensions between sects that have not yet ended in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority pursue a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets, using machetes, bows, and other primitive weapons.

Chelsea are almost half ahead of the match after the opening goal of Belgium star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this phase, the striker of the Royal Cavalry passes the ball to Mateo Kovacic before moving around the midfield area and rushing onto the Liverpool side of the field.
Kovacic had a wall pop from the middle of the field.
He had a beautiful fist, towards Hazard is rushing to the forbidden area.

The match between Liverpool and Napoli in the Champions League group stage will take place at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa Leaguge on Tuesday at 3 p.m. in London.
Damage from the Indonesian tsunami reached 832.
The death toll from earthquakes and waves in Indonesia has risen to 832, the National Disaster Center announced early Sunday.
Many people were said to have been trapped in the wreckage of buildings brought back by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, which led to waves as high as 20 feet, centre spokeswoman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, is submerged in the rubble of buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman to death
After the discovery of the body of a woman discovered this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation has begun.
The 44-year-old was discovered at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, with stab wounds, after which a 32-year-old male suspect was arrested.
Police called on locals if they saw or heard anything, to report it.
Detective Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its early stages but I urge anyone in the John Street neighborhood of Birkenhead to report to us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I also urge anyone, especially the drivers, who have inadvertently saved anything from the corners of the journey to contact us as they can get important information for our investigation.”
Police identified the woman as a local resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the home.

The Cromwell statue of Congress becomes the latest memorial to the story of 'rewriting history'
The exclusion would be a trail of justice for the destruction of the Taliban by many of his followers, who have destroyed countless buildings and religions in Britain.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's words as "insane" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "It is inevitable that the debate about leaving the statues of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will become the focus.
Symbols of civil wars in England were not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be replaced by the actions of his father Thomas in the last century.
Cromwell's representative Sir William Hamo Thassycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and is part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Perhaps by the end of the 19th century, Cromwell will be seen by many as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his own mind, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it’s a perfectly accurate example of the topic in the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the next development of our country and Cromwell was a typical figure in the divide.
His achievements as a Defender of God are also worthy of honor and recognition.”
Pig Killer Attacks Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, known as "Yuan" was found dead with a severed artery, his whole body was bloodied near a cage in a market in Luo Banhui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a slaughterhouse on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is believed to have moved with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and saw a door of the pigstorm next to it open wide.
He said there was a large boar in the cage with blood around the muzzle.
The report of a forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs were bloody and incomplete,” the cousin, known as “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
Security cameras showed Yuan arriving at the market around 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, he was found dead.
The killer pig is not the pig in the brothers' herd.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market's regulator are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although uncommon, cases of human-attack pigs have been previously documented.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, injuring her husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pressed a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs aren’t usually aggressive but that the smell of blood can serve as a bait.
“They just want to be close.
“They’re reserved, they’re curious... they don’t want to hurt anyone.
You just need to treat them properly,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa brought heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa is weakening on its way to the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had 85 mph winds, Category 1 Windstorm, as of 5 a.m. on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward to the U.S. West Coast. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical cyclone forms, it will begin to carry much of the northern humidity temperature into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, low-pressure humidity temperatures will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous flash floods, debris streams and even the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Humid temperatures will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at the peaks, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to reach between 2 and 4 inches in the southwestern regions, especially across Arizona.
Flash floods can occur when the situation deteriorates rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
The situation will be extremely dilemma if you venture into the desert when there is a threat from tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into violent rivers and thunderstorms that will carry local wind gusts and dust whirlwinds.
The low pressure will bring some local heavy rains to many parts of the Southern California coast.
Total rainfall can reach more than half an inch, causing debris flows and slippery roads.
This will be the region’s first rainfall in the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical rains began pouring into Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before rains became more common late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will hit Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Extreme temperatures across the United States can be seen in October when the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in temperature in nearby localities.
A typical example of a significant temperature difference in the U.S. central region on Sunday.
The temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer warmth and warmth will be renewed and strengthened again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start in October with temperatures prevalent in about 80 in the Southern Plains to the northeast.
New York City temperatures could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees higher on average.
Long-term weather forecasts are suggesting a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's hearing on six television networks of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues, with broadcasters disrupting regular broadcasts with last-minute sensationalism on Friday: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a calm move, said he was 100% sure that it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing, Nielsen pointed out in the report on Friday.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures are not immediately available to other broadcasters including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has a number of problems when calculating the viewers in the office.
To correlate, the number of spectators is similar to that of a final-ticket match or an Oscar.
Fox News, the host of which strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all broadcasters with an average rating of 5.69 million viewers in an all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The concern remains strong after the hearing.
Flake is the central figure in Friday’s noise.
After the Republican moderate just released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was watched by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning that he was yelled at by protesters as he tried to move the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes turned down for a few minutes when questioned, broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the whole country?”
He was accused of saying, “You have power while too many women are powerless.”
Flake said before the elevator closed that his office had issued a statement, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television stations will have live coverage hours later, when the Judiciary Committee will have to vote on whether Brett Kavanaugh is nominated.
But Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would look into the charges against the candidate next week, something some in the minority Democrats have been urging.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his colleague, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice carries weight, as it is clear that the Republican Party will not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May Rejects 'Political Criticism' for Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May dismissed criticism of her plans to leave the European Union as a "political card" for Britain's future and undermined national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Session in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, Boris Johnson, the former foreign minister, stressed his counter-attack on their so-called Chequers deal over Brexit, arguing that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs is “completely absurd.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting case of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims dropped glasses during the clash.
Police found the glass from the scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on the glass, according to CBS’s WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Baton Rouge Regional Autopsy Bureau released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a bullet wound from the head to the neck.
The department is counting on Louisiana State Police, the Evacuation Task Force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, Southern University Police and regional residents to assist in the investigation for the arrest.
LSU’s physical director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law agency for its “integrity and pursuit of justice”.
Sims is only 20 years old.
The six-foot-tall striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 blows per game in the previous season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "short" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
Wade said, “That’s what you’ll always have to look out for.”
Volcano erupts into Mexico City
Ash erupted from the Popocatepetl volcano has flowed to neighbourhoods south of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater hit and they recorded 183 emissions and ash within 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring multiple upheavals and shakes.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash that blur the layers of car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of Independence Day
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, as thousands of protesters took part on the occasion marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's bipartisan vote on separatism.
A group of masked separatists were held back by riot police with eggs and powder paint, causing clouds of black dust on the often crowded streets of tourists.
The upheaval erupted late in the day when police used batons to crack down on the fight.
For hours, pro-independence supporters chanted "No Forgetting, No Forgiving" to face off with protesters protesting against the words, "Great Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remained high in the region under independent ideology a year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal with Madrid but welcomed by Catalan separatists.
Voters in the direction of independence dominated, although low approval ratings with anti-separatists largely boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling places in the region amid violent clashes.
Pro-independence factions camped through Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protests took place first, but they had to take place with other developments.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist rally with his wife, said he had no hope of Catalonia's prospects for independence.
“Last year we had the happiest moments.
I watched my parents cry because they were happy to be able to vote but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite winning a key victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence factions have struggled to stay motivated this year with many of their most famous leaders either isolated or detained awaiting trial for their role in holding a referendum to declare independence afterwards.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who returned to the police pro-democracy rally with her phone, said the conflict had been extinguished by politicians on both sides.
“The story is getting more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison ahead of trial since late last year, announced he would run for election in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Joining as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the backsliding in democratic and repressive values that we have witnessed from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car crashed into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Police investigating Bob Blemmings said the incident caused damage to the gates and the building itself.
There were shots pointing at the car at some point.
Menga's shot brought a 1-0 win to Livingston over Rangers
Dolly Menga's lead to Livingston's victory
Livingston is on the rise to surprise Rangers as the Ibrox home team is led by Steven Gerrard with only two losses in 18 games.
Dolly Menga’s score proved to be different as Gary Holt’s side raised their sights on the Hibernian in a matter of seconds.
Gerrard’s side have yet to score a goal in the Premier League this season and face the Hearts leaders, who are eight points ahead, on Sunday.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has stretched his unbeaten streak of six games, as head coach Holt has also experienced defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity to play against the visitors below.
Holt’s team should have been ahead before they scored, with their front-facing tactics making Rangers more difficult.
Scott Robinson struggled but surpassed the goal, after which Alan Lithgow only managed to direct his efforts stronger after giving the ball to Craig Halkett on the sidelines.
The home team is confident to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can trouble the visitors with these individual techniques.
And that's the strategy for the fixed scoring shot.
Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston took the lead, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson teaming up towards Menga, who had the touchdown and scored right in the middle of the goal.
At the moment, Rangers have dominated the possession of the ball but find the defence is impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly is almost without difficulty,
The match continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos received help from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow switched to another Livingston play script.
The lead continued into the Livingston goal and was repeatedly caught, when two penalties – after Halkett's challenge to replace Glenn Middleton, one for touching the ball – were successfully prevented.
'Labeling' with Livingston - analysis
from BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A good result and match for Livingston.
The team was excellent, continuing to reach the expectations in the back-to-back.
The style of play and their players have rarely changed since they returned to the top, but significant credit must be given to Holt because of the way he has honed the team since he appeared.
You have too many strong players.
Captain Halkett is the overarching one, arranging a greatly organized defense, while Menga keeps Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Just like under Gerrard, they failed to meet those standards.
The last shot was missing - the only chance to open up the home team - and it was a wake-up call for Rangers, the team rebounding in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives many nuances in Cologne
There were smiles and favorable weather on Saturday (September 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at mending ties between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to attend the inauguration of a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to stop a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were also nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters — many of them Kurds — also spoke out, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflect the split of a guest hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and reviled by others as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: Bicyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the junction of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy neighborhood in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedic arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The crash came months after another cyclist was killed in a crash and fled on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
Police said they were working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Roads are blocked and buses are transferred and participants are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Riot
Six employees were injured in a riot in a prison for men with strict security, the prison officer said.
Riots erupted at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday morning and are still ongoing.
"Tornado" experts were sent to deal with the turmoil, which ended around 17:30.
Officers were examined at the scene with minor injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison administration said: “Special training prison staff has been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured workers were treated.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those individuals involved will be transferred to the police and may spend more time behind bars.”
HM Long Lartin holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the nation’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the Prison Superintendent had been treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officers were called to the prison to cope with a serious riot in which officers were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Slow Flooding (Flooding Zones Can Benefit)
Tropical depression hits Arizona very rarely, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the energy streaks of Hurricane Rosa in the southwest desert remain, entailing flash flood risks.
The National Meteorological Department released flash flood monitoring on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa was expected to go in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, but earlier on Monday night there were thunderstorms.
The National Meteorological Department in Phoenix mentioned in a brief message that only "ten tropical cyclones have formed tropical storms or tropical depressions within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest forecast models from the latest National Hurricane Center predict rainfall as high as 2 to 4 inches, with segregated flooding levels of up to 6 inches at the Mogollon Belt in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the central Rockies and Great Basin, will likely be flooded 1 to 2 inches, with segregated flooding levels of up to 4 inches.
For regions that are not suddenly flooded, the rain from Hurricane Rosa may be a good omen because this region is drought.
Although flooding is a deep concern, some waterfalls can be welcomed joyfully because the Southeast is suffering from drought.
According to weather.com, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the lowest level of extreme drought, but still the second highest in the same category.
First, the passage of Hurricane Rosa leaves landslides across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still in hurricane range with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit colder currents in the Pacific Ocean and weakened.
Therefore, forecasts suggest that there will be landslides in Mexico when the tropical depression passes by on Monday evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be significant, signaling the possibility of flooding.
According to Weather.com, "Total rainfall estimates range from 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest of Sonora, which could be up to 10 inches."
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then sweep across Arizona and make landfall in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger predicted by Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and life-threatening floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Intentional Murder Suspects Arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace at Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m.
You were taken to the hospital in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officers have urged people to go to the press if they can keep any video of the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the selfish, angry' of Democrats
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said during a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the selfishness, anger" of the Democratic Party during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh confronted Congress on Thursday, strongly and vehemently denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades before they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's excellence and quality and courage" that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to affirm that one of the most eminent legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a genuine public service resume,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president mentioned the details of Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy when talking about the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm elections.
Just five weeks from one of the most important elections in my life.
I'm not running, I'm running." He shared.
“That’s why I’m going around fighting for good candidates.”
Trump said Democrats want to “restrict and obstruct.”
“The first core procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday,” a senior Republican leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, more damage
At least 384 people have been killed, many washed away when huge waves hit the beaches, as a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves as high as six metres (18 feet) hit the shore at dusk, sweeping away leaving many dead and wreaking havoc on everything along its way.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still engaging in their activities on the beach and did not leave immediately and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Prevention Agency (BNPB), said in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, timber, houses, sweeping through everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some climbed onto trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque submerged in water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes has been observed in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Assessment and Technology Applications (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have strengthened the size of the tsunami, according to the publication.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage may not have stopped along the 300 km (190 miles) coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The media was "completely paralyzed with no news" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This has been a tragedy, but the tragedy could become much more horrifying,” they said.
The agency on Saturday was widely condemned for not announcing that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the wave had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social media, it is possible to hear a man standing high screaming panic at people in the street about the approaching tsunami.
A few minutes later, a wall of water flooded the shore, sweeping along buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that broke regional communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military had begun dispatching cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuees in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami has risen by more than 800.
Very bad situation.
While World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees were staying in canteens erected in office yards, they went through devastating scenes on the road, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad situation.
Even as aid groups began making significant moves at the start of disaster relief tools, some complained that highly specialized foreign aid workers were prevented from moving to Palu.
Under Indonesia’s regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government decides, ‘Yeah, this is a national disaster,’ then we can be ready with international assistance but have not spoken yet.”
As Monday night falls on Palu following Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be magically pieced together the gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled up from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paraglider team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, including the English Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon said that within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the paragliding community, he desperately texted with WhatsApp to rivals in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
However, his message indicates a grey product instead of two green ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t sent,” he said.
The robbers stole $26,750 when the ATM was refilled at Newport in Levee.
According to the Newport Police Department, the robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink bank employee while they were loading money into an ATM at Newport in Levee.
The driver cleaned the ATM in the entertainment district and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported.
While he was busy, a man "came from behind the Brink employee" and took away the bag of money that had to be handed over.
Witnesses said they saw several suspects loitering around the scene, but police did not identify the number of suspects involved in the crime.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspect please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He tweeted about the change on Saturday: “Everyone knew me as Kanye West before.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and uses the name as the eighth album to be released in June.
The change took place before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He was a guest on the show on behalf of singer Ariana Grande when she said she was “emotionally disturbed,” the creator of the show said.
As with the abbreviation in his current name, West had previously said the word had a religious meaning for him.
“I believe that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, while chatting about the title of his album with broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I’m friends, I’m us, it’s us.
The transition from Kanye, which means solely, to Ye – the reflection of good, bad, the contemplation, everything.
The album is more than a reflection of ourselves.
He is one of the most famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs is widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he was targeting Love and Brother Love.
An artist who previously worked with West, JAY-Z, is also wondering about whether or not there are dashes and capital letters.
Mexico's president says he will not send troops against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of its bloody revenge on students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "never send troops to oppress the Mexican people."
The military opened fire during a peace rally in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at the time as left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by offering monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said the problem of unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities has led young people to engage in evils.
The U.S. should double its A.I. aid.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even while the U.S. overall was lacking a formal AI strategy.
China, meanwhile, introduced its plan last year: to become the nation’s leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a positive start, as all other countries are far behind the United States, and we’re looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubled funding could double the chances that the next huge AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “Artificial Intelligence Superpower: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at an AI system that beat the highest-ranked Othello player in the U.S., then he was chief executive officer at Microsoft Research and director of Google's China branch.
Lee approaches previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Advanced Projects Research Agency’s Robot Challenge and cares about when the next competition will take place, to help define the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often struggle to get government aid, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s getting all the scholars at the forefront; it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright stars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States bolster its AI efforts.
He added: “I think green cards should be automatically issued to PhDs in AI.”
China’s State Council issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee added: “China’s National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides aid to those in academic institutions similar to the way the Foundation and other government organizations subsidize U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to intervene with partners from industry and education, and the White House announced the creation of an Artificial Intelligence Selection Committee.
This month the Defense Advanced Research Projects Steering Agency announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they now invest more than $100 million a year in AI research.
U.S. law has sought to establish a National Security Council for Artificial Intelligence, but has not seen a move in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing national name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "Northern Macedonia," a move to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece aimed at blocking accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has vetoed NATO and EU membership.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the newly proposed name, but opponents of nationalism say the change would undermine the national identity of much of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the voters would meet at least 50 percent of the requirements for the referendum’s validity.
The question on the referendum ballot reads: “Do you agree to become a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of a deal with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said it was a price to pay to pursue joining organizations such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from Yugoslavia’s collapse.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje, said: "Today I come to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can freely enjoy the patronage of the European Union because it is towards a safer life for all of us."
While members of parliament are not legally bound, they have said they will abide by the vote to make a decision.
The name change would require two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the share of voters only reached 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in last year’s parliamentary elections when 66 percent of voters registered to vote.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, of Skopje, said: "I vote for my children, because we are in Europe."
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which would pave the way for NATO and European Union accession in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small podium and pulling a chair in front of a tent erected by people who would boycott the referendum.
Kavadarkov said: “We support NATO and the EU, but we want to take part in the main road, not through the backdoor.”
“We are a poor country, but poor to clean.
“If they don’t see us as Macedonia, then we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasia.”
Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe a majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said a “vote” would be “an affirmation of our future.”
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum — well below the required vote.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, said 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they voted yes.
A successful referendum must have a voting rate of 50 percent and one vote.
The defeat in the referendum marked the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it took place in May last year.
Sergio Aguero at Manchester City has pierced the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the defence of Brighton with Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed his level with a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass from the middle of the field when he started to lead the ball.
He chased ahead of three Brighton defenders before breaking into the empty court.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four blue shirt players.
He chased up a defender before stopping the other opponents at the edge of the Brighton goal.
Pass to the left, directing the ball to Sterling.
The Englishman led his first touch in the penalty area to Aguero, who hit his right shoe with a shot to knock Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan down from the right of the net.
Pep Guardiola told reporters: "Aguero has suffered some leg injuries.
"We talked about just letting him play for 55 or 60 minutes.
What happened.
We were so lucky that he scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the first advantage to the Blues in the Premier League game.”
Scoring in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a dribble deep into Brighton's wing during the match.
He took a top-flight shot to the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane with a few leads before leading Sterling to the top goal.
The striker wearing the Blue Shirt put the ball into the net just before the ball slipped out of control.
The match between City and Hoffenheim in the Champions League took place at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to burn all of us against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the final round, there wasn’t much reason to start over.
But a belligerent Scherzer hopes to win Sunday's pitch against the Colorado Rockies, but that only makes sense when it comes to the Rockies, which lead the way to a match against the Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
The Rockies secured at least one special spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure the top spot.
“Although it makes no sense to play, at least we get to throw the ball when we learn about the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams that will play in whatever form the highest I can play this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in a game like that?
The Nationals have yet to announce the player's debut in Sunday's game, but it looks like Scherzer will be kicking the ball in this situation.
Scherzer, who kicks off his 34th start, will have a pitching practice on Thursday and play on his Sunday break.
The Washington team's right arm has an 18-7 record with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 matches this season.
Trump's Campaign in West Virginia
The president covered the details of the situation around his Supreme Court, choosing Brett Kavanaugh when talking about the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm elections.
“Everything we do has potential in November.
Just five weeks from one of the most important elections in my life.
“This is one of the big, big things – not running for office but running is why I’m going around fighting for the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You’re going to see the extreme, negative Democratic Party that’s here right now.
And they are determined to suppress power by using whatever tactics, and then you will see selfishness, tactics.
“They don’t care who’s hurt, who they’re stepping on to gain power and control, they just want power and control, and we’re not going to give them that.”
He added, “Democrats are looking for “restrictions and obstructions.”
“You’ve seen that in the last four days,” he added, adding that Democrats are “angry and selfish and manipulative and false.”
He pointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s assessment of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was buzzing from the bottom.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you disclose the information?
What?
No, no, I expected—it was a kind of body language that wasn’t excellent—it was the worst kind of body language I’d ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer an open party.
Making an opinion is unacceptable.
I was not surprised when the activists of Momentum, in my local party, voted to censor me.
I was, after all, the latest in a series of Labour MPs to be told that I was unwelcome – for raising my opinion.
My fellow congresswoman, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because she firmly supported opposition.
In my case, the censorship move was directed at me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a high-profile economic policy, on national security, in Europe, the same irony that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
Notification to the Nottingham East Labor Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years as a MP for the local Labour Party, Friday night’s leaders’ meetings were all held in such a way.
Sadly, today, it’s not the tone of many meetings and the promise of politics “more kindly, more tenderly” has long been forgotten and actually whether that ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged on whether the party's leaders will accept them or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as former colleagues I thought shared political views with me had begun to expect me to shift my mind and take on positions that I would never approve – whether on national security or the EU market directive.
Whenever I speak publicly – and indeed whatever I say – the abuse on social media that calls for removal, denounces central politics, tells me that I should not join the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who feels that way.
Indeed, I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments pointed at me are politically inclined.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the flow of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away from it.
One of the saddest aspects of this political age is the degree to which abuse has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer that open Party and with every move of “no confidence” or change in the rule of choice, the Party has become shrinking.
I’ve had a lot of advice in the last two years about urging me to stay calm, not too many words, and then I’ll be “okay.”
But I'm not involved in politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a young boy, I was motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which literally caused my comprehensive school to collapse, I have sought to bring better public services to those who need them most – whether local commissioners or government ministers.
I have never concealed my political views, not even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be wronged about my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the move on Friday, all I want to share is that as the country lapses into Brexit, which will hurt our households, businesses and public services, I have no desire to waste my time and energy on loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But really, a message outside of Nottingham Momentum that I wing, to my voters, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve and I promise that there will be no threat of elimination or any political means to prevent me from acting for what I believe is in the greatest interest of my relatives.
Chris Leslie is a member of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Ayr unbeaten lead
The latter two attempts may have falsified the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this prestigious Tennent Premiership match of the day.
Now they are at the top of the group, the only crown of ten teams.
In any case, it’s also their super defense, as well as much as a better chance for them, the home team and coach Peter Murchie are absolutely right to be satisfied.
He added: “So far, we’ve been through our games and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m satisfied.”
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "Give Ayr credit, they take better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute scoring, scored by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but, a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, opened the game for the Warriors, allowing Melrose to show skill and Jason Baggot to make a pitch to the goal.
Climo rose to lead Ayr with a penalty, before, even in the first half, he scored an extra point with a solo scoring 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose had started the second half well and Patrick Anderson scored, Baggot added points, shortening the score to five.
After a long period of severe injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was left behind, and since the reboot, Ayr has outperformed thanks to Stafford McDowall's score, Climo added points.
Acting captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson, then suffered a yellow card, and again, Melrose cost the extra player a non-scoring assist by Bruce Colvine, in the face of intense pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellowed for playing against Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson scored against Ayr's assist.
Climo scored more points, as he had done almost since his return, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's pitch and passed to winger Gregor Henry after the home team's fifth scoring.

Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon were painted with the slogan: “The sea is our right.
“Returning the sea is our mission.”
Every corner of Bolivia’s land, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains alive – as well as the desire to sail out into the Pacific once again.
Those hopes are perhaps the most burning in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said: “Bolivia is motivated, united and calm, and, of course, expected in a positive view of the outcome.”
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ’s ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia’s claim that — after decades of tense exchanges — Chile is obliged to negotiate for a sovereign sea access.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s persuasive president, who faces a fierce debate for re-election next year, also has more cards in Monday’s ruling.
At the end of August, he insisted: “We are about to get back to the Pacific.”
But some analysts say the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia – and this is less likely to change.
The United Nations, which is based in the Netherlands, has no right to hand over its territory to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of potential exchanges.
The ICJ’s ruling came just six months after the final debates showed the situation was “uncomplicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And even further from Bolivia’s litigation, the last four years could be reversed.
Zárate said: “The issue of access to the sea has been attacked by the current Bolivian government.”
She added that Morales’s belligerent statements have silenced the rest of Chile’s goodwill.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of ties with Chile" and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement of mutual interests.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — was using the maritime issue as a political lifeboat.
He added: “Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific.”
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to step through the past.”
North Korea says it will never have nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has revealed that his country will never dismantle nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington beforehand.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two sides.
He made the remarks as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be preparing to restart nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "illusionary dream" of continuing U.S. sanctions and opposition to the declaration to end the Korean War to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautiously agreeing to the statement without Pyongyang making notable disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump look forward to a second summit.
But there is no small doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that it can see as the only way to stay safe.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion Paris launches its latest line of wide-brimmed hats that are about to cover all the major streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely avoid the sun, you don’t have to look far.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveil a series of unusual head-sized designs in their SS19 collection on the runway that will stun the design at Paris Fashion Week.
Non-applicable hats swept Instagram this summer and the designers brought their eye-catching creations to the runway.
Valentino’s standout item is a beige hat over the top of the wide rim attached to feather-like accessories, covering the model’s head.
Other oversized accessories include a picky watermelon, a witch hat, and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks are stitched in a style more similar to Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One is like a scuba diving device complete with a snorkel and goggles, while another looks like a melting ice cream cone.
And if you keep catching up with the giant fashion – then you’re in luck.
Fans are predicting that large-sized hats may soon be spreading across the big streets near you.
Big-sized hats become hot on the heels of ‘La Bomba’, the few inches wide-brimmed hat used by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The craving brand behind the ultra-unrealistic hat that’s rolled up across social media has brought another big creation to the runway – a beach bag that’s nearly as big as a bathing suit.
The flammable orange raffia fiber bag, flared with raffia fiber with white leather handles on top, is a standout item in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large-sized hats and beach bags flooding the big streets next summer – as the designer has made such a huge impact that it’s hard to ignore the need for large-sized accessories.”
John Edwards: Foreign language skills are essential for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland maintain their academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with a string of commendable academic results, reinforced both individually and collectively in terms of sports, arts, music and community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, sponsored by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), are striving to deliver the best quality of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to equip students with deep and broad knowledge, as well as career orientation and the status of their students as global citizens.
As a branch of education that can design and run the school’s distinctive curriculum, we see modern foreign languages continue to be a popular and chosen subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, the things he says will come into his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, the things he says go into his heart.”
This is a convincing message that we don’t rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From recent exams this year, we can see that foreign languages are leading the way in the rankings with the best scores in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students scored higher than A.
Data collected from SCIS’ 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored more than an A in Chinese, while 72 percent learned German, 69 percent learned French and 63 percent learned Spanish also scored an A.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland are moving towards treating foreign languages as essential skills that children and adolescents will not be able to without in the future.
Elective foreign language subjects are being valued as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) majors in private school programs as well as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Careers and Skills Council in 2014 found that among the reasons employers have difficulty finding people, is a lack of foreign language skills.
Therefore, foreign language skills are becoming more and more practical in order to equip young people to enter professional practice in the future.
With more and more career opportunities requiring a foreign language, these skills become practical in an increasingly flat world.
Regardless of how people choose to work, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly in the native language, a multilingual person will obviously lead any challenge.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them are unable to practice a simple section in a foreign language, and French is the only foreign language with a 15 percent percentage.
That’s why investing in foreign language teaching is essential for children today.
Taking multilingual, especially those in developing economies, will equip children with brighter potential to find a real job.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern foreign languages, while others will teach foreign languages that are considered important for the UK in view of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests children enjoy, there are a variety of foreign languages to choose from in private schools, along with a team of teachers with expertise in the profession.
Private schools in Scotland focus on providing an academic environment that prepares and equips children with the skills necessary for success, no matter what the future holds.
It is undeniable that, in an international business environment, foreign languages will continue to be an extremely important factor for the future of the nation, which should be replicated in education.
In fact, modern foreign languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Private schools will continue to offer this opportunity to Scottish youth: diversity and excellence.
There's no other choice.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private School Board.
LeBron made his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is coming to an end for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James play the first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But how long you're going to be in the game is yet to be determined.
Walton said on the Lakers' official website: "It'll be in less than 48 minutes."
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said there was a possibility that James would be in the game for a limited time.
Following the week's training sessions, James was asked about plans for six pre-season games at the Lakers.
He said: “I don’t need to play a few pre-season games at this stage of my career.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins his campaign.
This is the first stop in Trump's five campaigns next week, including in states like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote to approve his nominee for the vacant Supreme Court vacancy is being delayed, with Trump trying to win support ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans face the risk of losing control of Congress as the vote begins in November.
What time does the Trump campaign in West Virginia start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week’s hearing by Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court Justice nominee who is now facing sexual assault charges and the Senate confirmation vote that must be delayed by a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
However, the main purpose of the rally is to enlist support for Republican candidates ahead of the November election.
According to Reuters, the campaign’s goal is to pass five campaigns next week to “energize volunteers and Republican supporters in the race to protect and expand the majority of the votes they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
"Congressional control is an important issue on the agenda, so the president will visit as many states as possible before entering the busy election season," a campaign spokesman for Trump said.
Expected to take place at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, tonight’s campaign could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, while also attracting the Pittsburgh media to report,” West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit in the past month to West Virginia, which he won by 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, the Republican nominee for a West Virginia senator, as he is currently behind in the polls.
Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters: “The fact that the president has to visit the state to enlist support in the vote for the candidate is not a good sign for Morrisey.”
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows determination to fight to keep the trophy in singles matches on Sunday
After three disproportionate matches, a doubles match on Saturday afternoon may be essential for the Ryder Cup.
A pendulum-style wrist swing to create momentum is a completely new sporting concept, but it’s also a movement that athletes really believe in, especially in matches like this.
So where is the momentum now?
“They were six points ahead, they are now four, and I think that’s what motivated us,” Jordan Spieth said as he strolled.
Of course, the European team has an advantage, four points ahead, and they have 12 more games left.
As Spieth said, the U.S. team still has some hope and they are very encouraged, especially with the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas. These two players have played many times and each have won three points.
Spieth is a veteran golfer who plays the ball from the starting point to the hole and he always leads the way as an example.
The shouts of joy grew louder as he reached the round, especially the swipe to equalise the match as he and Thomas played the ball into the hole one after another.
The 15th-day win is the same, meaning he fully believes in the U.S. team’s back-up.
Spieth said: “You have to think carefully and worry about your own game.”
All the athletes have left.
There are 18 holes left to score.
Over the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an indisputable Ryder Cup legend, have been the only couple to score higher than Spieth and Thomas.
This odd but respectable pair of European teams have won 4:0 and can not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only pair that does not bogey on Saturday afternoons, but also avoids bogey on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the following nine holes on Friday mornings.
That victory and the energy from them spread to the crowd of cheering fans giving people the feeling that the two of them were opponents to beat on Sunday; and there was no player more deserving than Fleetwood or Molinari to defend the European team’s victory at sunset on Le Golf National.
Hopefully both of you will appear in different holes at the same time.
However, it is still too early to confirm the European team’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson beat out Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball series in the morning, playing in pairs with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes had the Spaniard and Swedish player completely lost the chance to counterattack.
On Sunday, I'm afraid no one can pull them out of that defeat.
Fourball and foursome matches are always the best to watch because of the interaction between the duo, their advice and observing the gameplay strategy change in a fraction of a second.
The European team played better teammates and were far ahead of the final day, but this foursome series shows that the U.S. team still has a chance to win.
Europe lead 10-6 ahead of the start of the final Ryder Cup
The European team will take advantage before the final day of the Ryder Cup after the spectacular fourball and foursome series, leading the U.S. team 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led this advantage with two wins against Tiger Woods to win another four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on the European side, determined to win the trophy back to his friend at Hazeltine two years ago, won the U.S. in the morning fourball, leading 3-1.
The U.S. team played better in the foursome series, winning two games, but could not win the final.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points in Sunday’s singles series to win back the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European player to win four points in a row when he and Molinari, often referred to as the "Molliwood" pairing, were the second couple after dramatic weekends that won four points in the opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a fourball match, they had a more convincing win over Woods and rookie American Bryson Dechambeau with a score of 5&4.
Woods has played two matches on Saturday and sometimes flashes of light, but so far, he has lost 19 of the 29 games in the fourball and foursome series, including seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, after resting in the morning fourball series, returned with Henrik Stenson in the foursome, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were ranked 1st and 3rd in the world, with a score of 2&1.
However, despite the pleasant weather in southwest Paris, the European team did not have an easy day to play.
Three-time big-winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a milestone for the U.S. team with two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 convincingly against the Spaniards, Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball, and then went on to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 in foursome, despite missing the first two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, only twice a four-point lead can start singles matches, though the Furyk team just need to hold a draw to keep the trophy.
After being considered second for only two days, Sunday is likely to become a backwards blow for the team.
North Korea Says 'No Way' to Unilaterally Disarm Without Faith
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions still being upheld deepened its distrust of the United States and that in this situation it would never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly, said North Korea had taken "many goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing bases and pledging non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we don’t see similar moves from the US side,” he said.
“If we cannot trust the United States, we will not be confident in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri has repeated North Korea’s familiar complaint that Washington has refused to disarm nuclear weapons “phasically” and that North Korea would receive the corresponding benefit of taking them step by step, his remarks this time have a noteworthy point of not rejecting the unilateral disarmament Pyongyang has previously refused.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12. In the statement, Kim pledged efforts towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," while Trump promised security for North Korea.
North Korea is still trying to find a way to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insists it must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington is also opposed to calls for easing harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goals in a coercive manner, even protesting the 'declaration of an end to the war'," Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a fantasy dream of people who don’t know us.
“But the problem is that these sanctions continue to lose our trust.”
Ri made no mention of plans to host a second summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader presented at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the negotiating party on the nuclear disarmament issue is South Korea, not the United States, then the denuclearization talks on the Korean Peninsula will not fall into the present stalemate.”
Ri's tone, however, was different from last year, when he told the General Assembly that North Korea's missile launch on the U.S. mainland was inevitable on a suicide mission after "Evil President" Trump called Kim a "Rocket Man."
Last year at the United Nations, Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, but this year praised Kim for bravely taking steps to disarmament, but he stressed that much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea disarmaments.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t set a deadline for this: “Two years, three years, or even five months doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its efforts.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Security Council sanctions must continue to be vigorously and intransigently enforced until we can confirm the result of complete denuclearization, ultimately, with verifiable evidence.”
The Security Council has agreed to step up sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of official UN General Assembly meetings and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the results of the final visit are not very positive.
He left Pyongyang after a visit in July and said negotiations had made progress, but only hours later, North Korea accused the foreign minister of making “mafia-like demands.”
North Korea has pledged to take part in a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-In this month to dismantle a missile test base and a nuclear complex if the United States makes a "similar move."
He said Chairman Kim directed that the "similar move" he was seeking was the security guarantee that Trump had pledged during the Singapore talks and toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a full rest course
In an effort to combat a machine-pressure learning culture, with ‘night owl students’ drinking coffee instead of water, a new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all college students to sleep more.
Students at the world’s number one university often don’t know the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Women’s Hospital and Brigham designed the course and he believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for this course came after he took a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on the learning process.
“After finishing the talk, a female student came to me and said, ‘Why didn’t you know this until your last year?’
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of good sleep habits to improve learning and athletic outcomes, while improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to recommend the course after finding students with severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course covers a wide range of interactive tasks.
In the dorm room section, students can click on coffee cups, curtains, workout machines and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, how light and sleep deprivation affect athletic performance, as well as the importance of shaping the habit of going to bed on time.
In another section, participants were asked how long-term sleep deprivation could increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, the university campus map, with interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this course cannot immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” Czeisler added.
“The culture of pride of ‘night owl students’ still exists, and modern technologies and increasing pressure on students lead to sleep deprivation as a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, good quality sleep should become a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to fall into a state of hunger, leading us to be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying biology, chemistry and physics, helped Czeisler design the course, and took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course helped him “open his eyes” and inspired him to make an effort to call for a course across the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to join a similar curriculum before starting to compete in the main course.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider when setting their bedtime alarm, waking hours, and being aware of the harms of the ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes down Gerrard's boys
Rangers had an unsuccessful day when Dolly Menga's counterattack caused Steven Gerrard's team to lose 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox hoped to mark their first win since their 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as head coach, stretching an eight-point gap from the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga maintained the attacking position seven minutes before the end of the first half, but Rangers' temperament seemed to have never been crushed.
Rangers have now fallen to 6th place, while Livingston has climbed to 3rd place, and just behind Hibernian in goal difference.
And Rangers had to deal with another problem after referee Calum Spence had to treat a head injury after a clear object was thrown from the front of the field.
Gerrard changed the squad eight times from the one who had passed Ayr to reach the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, retained Livi 11, which drew a point against the Hearts team last week and must have been delighted with the way his pupils surrounded the opponent in each attack.
Although Rangers hold the ball more, Livingston is the team that actually poses the danger of having the ball.
They should have scored just two minutes after Menga first sent Scott Pittman on the pitch, attacking Allan McGregor’s goal but the midfielder missed this opportunity.
A deep shot by Keaghan Jacobs brought the ball to the feet of captain Craig Halkett, but defender Alan Lithgow could only put the ball to the back of the goalpost.
Rangers take control of the ball on the pitch, but their gameplay is based on more hope than confidence, especially during the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos insisted that he should receive a penalty on penalties because he and Steven Lawless had a collision but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian player's appeal.
Rangers only scored twice in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's counterattack.
Although Livi’s opening in the 34th minute was supposed to be an advantage, no one could deny that their win was entirely worth it.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to handle Jacobs' deep edge throw.
Scott Arfield failed to react when Declan Gallagher pitched the ball to Scott Robinson, and Scott calmly chose Menga to make a simple finish.
Gerrard immediately had the option during the break, by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the replacement almost had an immediate impact when the winger poked the ball to Morelos but Kelly was impressed by immediately blocking the direction of the ball.
But Livingston succeeded in enticing the visitors to play the game they wanted, as Lithgow and Halkett repeatedly rolled out long passes.
Holt's team had a chance to rise to the top in the last minutes of the game, but unfortunately McGregor chose the right position to stop Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
Newcomer Glenn Middleton of Rangers appealed for penalties after colliding with Jacobs, but was again rejected by referee Thomson.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
Quoting a page from the "Sunday Morning" Yearbook: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and CONTINUE TO ... future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, inventing the foundation for a device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has become not only a mainstay of science, but also a pillar of popular culture. The following example is a dialogue in the 1950 film "Bills of Coronado", starring scientist and cowboy king Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radiation in the mineral.”
Evans: “Yeah, there’s a noise here!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name, however, remains with time.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System How to ‘Watch’ Damaged Cells
New Cancer Vaccines Can Teach The Immune System How To ‘Watch’ Damaged Cells And Kill Them
Vaccines teach the immune system how to recognize damaged cells during treatment
This method involves taking immune cells from patients, changing cells in the lab.
These cells can then ‘see’ proteins common in many cancers and re-injected into the body.
An experimental vaccine is delivering positive results in patients with different cancers.
A woman is treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize damaged cells and her ovarian cancer cells disappear after more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from patients, changing cells in the lab, so that these cells can "see" the protein common in many cancers, called HER2, which is then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands.”
HER2 “promotes the development of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar research method, taking immune cells from the patient’s body and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells, once worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye receives many "bricks" for showing frantic support for President Trump, wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after Saturday Live Music Night (SNL)
Things didn't go well.
Kanye West received numerous booings in the studio during the SNL Music Night, after his rambling performance. During the performance, he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and vowed to run in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, still wearing his Make America Great Again hat, he angrily expressed his opposition to the Democratic Party and affirmed his support for President Trump.
“Many times I talk to my white friends and they say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
If I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a subtitle starring Matt Damon. In the subtitle, this Hollywood star sarcastically took Brett Kavanaugh's oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations.
Although the show was not aired, the footage of West's angry remarks was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear whether Rock intentionally mocked West for posting this.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was uncomfortable in the back of the chicken wing just because of his hat.
“They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go on a show with that hat.'
They bullied me!
Then they said I was bogged down,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "Do you know what it's like to be bogged down?", he insisted that he would "wear my hero's iconic hat, because no one can force me to do anything. If you want the world to move forward?
Let's love."
Variety reported: His speech made the crowd yell at least twice, while the SNL member was confused, one shared: "The whole studio is dead."
West was chosen to replace singer Ariana Grande, as her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West panicked many with his performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Bottle Perrier.
West received the support of TPUSA's head of conservative group Candace Turner, who once tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: PLEASE THANK YOU FOR SAYING THE POPULAR SPEAK."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “acting in his own way, and that’s really cool.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying a musical product or costume, or supporting his ‘art’) because I believe that the person is pursuing and propagating ideology that is not good for my community.
He has the right to freedom.
We do too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, officially "named Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, but only followed Diddy's path, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Lion; the late music legend Prince, also changed his name to an icon and later changed his name to Prince.
Accused of murder in stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is scheduled to appear in the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The allegation will be investigated by the Prosecutor’s Office.
An angry Game of Thrones movie star criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy television series, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is quite angry with the hero’s archetype and mentions that the male characters on the screen will make young men feel strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something is wrong here" and raised the question of how to tackle the <0x23>MeToo era's toxic masculinity.
Kit recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, 31. He admits he feels 'quite necessary' to solve this problem.
“At this point, I personally feel like I don’t know what we’ve done wrong with so-called masculinity,” he said.
“What have we taught men as adults about the problems that lie ahead of us?”
Kit believes that television may also be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity caused by the extremely masculine characters they build.
He continued: ‘What characteristic is innate and what characteristic is due to education?
What is being taught on TV and on the street that makes boys feel like they have to become male stereotypes?
I think this is really a dilemma of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously there was something unreasonable about our young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be participating in any more prequels or spinoffs about Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, adding that he was “bored of battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s True West remake that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing when he decided to stop playing Game of Thrones.
“I’ve met my wife in this series, which is where I started my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the love interest of the character Jon Snow that Kit plays in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018, on the grounds of Leslie’s family’s mansion in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China Reports 14% Increase in New Infections
The number of Chinese living with HIV and Aids has increased by 14 percent.
Health officials say the country has more than 820,000 people with the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of new cases was recorded at 40,000.
The vast majority of new infections are caused by sexually transmitted infections. This is a major change from the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people living with HIV following this path has dropped to almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000 each year.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection is a serious ongoing problem in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has not been considered illegal in China since 1997, in practice, discrimination against the LGBT community is still very common.
Due to the country’s traditional conservative values, the study estimates that 70-90% of men end up still married, despite having arisen sexual intercourse with men.
Many people are infected with the disease of the century by not using adequate protection when having same-sex sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to providing HIV medicines to all infected patients to cope with the disease.
Maxine Waters has denied her staff leaked data from Republican senators, stressing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, Democrat Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican senators to Wikipedia about lawmakers.
Democrats in Los Angeles insisted the complaints were settled by “far-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and lies are even more despicable,” Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
According to the report, the leak included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
The information began appearing online Thursday by an unidentified person at Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The revelation came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses identified the source of the posts linked to Waters’ office and disclosed information about one of Waters’ employees.
Waters went on to say, “This unfounded accusation is absolutely untrue and absolutely a lie.”
“The employee in my office has been compromised with his identity, personal information and safety due to these false and misleading allegations.
“This unfounded accusation is absolutely untrue and absolutely a lie.”
Waters’s statement immediately drew criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection expresses anger," Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that she has no temperament to become a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of an act that is not theirs, one should not be angry.
They are not challenged.
They were not questioned about the motives of the accuser.
They have to show calmness and calmness.”
Fleischer appears to be comparing Waters’ reaction to Judge Kavanaugh’s response to criticism from Democrats and critics who also accused him of being too angry at Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters’ position in the midterm elections, also voiced his views on Twitter.
"Big if true," he wrote on Twitter.
Waters said her office had warned “the authorities and law enforcement about these false allegations.”
“We will make sure the perpetrators are brought to light,” she continued, “and they will be held accountable for all actions that could be damaging and dangerous to any of my employees.”
Johnny English is a comedic, useless spy by Rowan Atkinson.
Now, it's quite a traditional trend in any new British film to look for the meaning of Brexit. And the next episode of the Johnny English spy comedy-action series is no exception. The series premiered in 2003, with Johnny English and Johnny English Part 2, which premiered in 2011.
Will the act of mocking ourselves on the subject of how useless we are become a new export opportunity for this nation?
Anyway, the limited-edition spy Johnny English with rounded eyes and flexible facial muscles is allowed to mess things up again – his name simply represents a comic book designed for non-English-speaking regions.
Of course he’s an undercover agent, though he always pretends to be weird in the style of Inspector Clouseau, mixing Mr. Bean’s humor and something that contributes to the theme melody of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
The character’s prototype is also based on the international traveler and mystery man Atkinson once starred in the Barclaycard TV commercial that has now fallen into oblivion and caused chaos upon waking up.
There are some interesting scenes in the latest Johnny English episode.
I liked the sight of Johnny English approaching the helicopter while wearing medieval armor and propellers pounding on his hat.
Although Atkinson’s humor is well-expressed, the element of humor here seems to be insufficient and somewhat redundant, especially as "serious" franchises such as the 007 series and Mission Impossible have left comedy as a spice.
The humor in this movie can only make fun of children, I myself think Johnny English’s blunders are not as creative and remarkable as the jokes in Atkinson’s Mr. Bean silent movie.
The situation that led the story was that England was in serious trouble.
Hackers have infiltrated the super-secret British spy network, revealing the identities of all British spies operating outside, leading to the dismay of a missionary agent, a very unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance choice of the prime minister, a proud and powerful figure, who is now facing this lopsided political crisis: Emma Thompson has portrayed this version of Prime Minister Teresa May very well, but in the scenario she doesn’t have a lot of land.
Intelligence advisers reported that the identity of all active spies had been exposed and that she would have to mobilize a retired spy.
And that person was the awkward Johnny English, who was teaching in the countryside, but in fact was teaching off-the-program lessons to become a secret agent: there were some pretty interesting jokes here, because English taught students to be spies in the style of the Rock Academy.
English is summoned back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with former assistant Bough, played by actor Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, taking a ride with a charming female submarine commander. Vicki Pepperdine takes on the role of this talented little waste.
So the duo Batman and Robin who are troublemakers with the Queen's Orders return to duty and meet Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful spy Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger under the curse of the seductive tech billionaire after claiming he can solve all of Britain’s computer headaches: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventure with unimaginable antics: after disguising themselves as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant at a glance; caused chaos on Volta's luxury yacht; and English even more cluttered when trying to use Virtual Reality headsets to probe Volta's home.
At the end of the movie, the knots will definitely be removed, but the excitement is quite similar to the television channels for children.
It's a pretty ordinary work.
And like the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but ask: Can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a fair role, worthy of your talent?
The Labour Party denies it is working on a plan to allow British people to work four days but receive a five-day paycheck.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will allow Britons to work four days a week but earn five days a week.
According to information received, the party wants business owners to transfer their savings from the artificial intelligence revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This means that employees can take a three-day weekend off but still receive the same salary as before.
Sources said the idea was "in line" with the party's economic agenda and expected to increase support for the country's workers.
The British Trade Unions Congress has confirmed the move to work four days a week as a way for workers to enjoy the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “The process of reviewing policies is expected to be announced later this year.
“This goal cannot be achieved in the short term, but working four days a week is an aspiration in line with the party’s policy of rebalancing the economy to the benefit of workers as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse the idea. Britain's Green Party pledged to work four days a week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, the idea has not been adopted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day work week policy is not the policy of the party and the party does not currently consider it.”
Shadow Prime Minister John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to bolster his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “anonymous directors” and “exploitants” at utility companies.
These plans by the shadow prime minister also mean that current shareholders in water-supply companies may not be able to get back their entire stakes because the Labour government can apply ‘deductions’ based on behavior that is deemed wrong.
He also confirmed plans for employees to join the company’s board and set up a Comprehensive Ownership Fund to give 10% of private companies’ equity to company employees, from which they can receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy shares in "60 Minutes" on whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh led them to change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote to appoint him to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised questions about whether the Federal Intelligence Agency's findings could lead any Republican senator to withdraw support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI had found evidence that would have led them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his counterpart from South Carolina.
“I think of course,” Kennedy said.
“I spoke during the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after the allegation was made and asked, ‘Did you do that?’
He answered with determination, determination and determination.”
However, Graham’s vote seemed to be absolutely certain.
“I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh and only one accusation is going to change me.”
“Professor Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all the people she named were unable to verify the story.
Thirty-six years have passed.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizenship Festival and does it contribute to the Elimination of Poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Civics Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive star cast to fulfill an equally impressive mission: to end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Hunger Reduction Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To receive free admission to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees must complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling a phone or any other meaningful form to help raise awareness about the goal of poverty alleviation.
But how successful has this Global Citizenship Festival been, now that it has only 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding tickets for a free music night for people a practical way to convince people to call to action, or is it just another form of “keyboard movement” — people feel they’re making a real difference by signing a petition online or posting a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizenship Foundation has reported more than 10 million “actions” from its supporters, advancing a range of different goals.
They say these actions have helped motivate leaders around the world to make commitments and policies equivalent to the more than $37 billion set up to implement interventions that improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from the group’s actions, with at least $10 billion either disbursed or fundraised.
The group estimates that so far, secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partner organization that includes investors and practitioners, committed to “helping children do their best,” promising to provide $25 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter posts from the Global Citizens team.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can turn social injustice leading to malnutrition into a marker in history,” Nutrition Power Ambassador Tracey Ullman told audiences during a live performance in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project called Nutritional Strength, which ensures nutritional intervention for 5 million women and children.
Answer to one of the group’s Frequently Asked Questions on the group’s website “what makes you believe we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizens responded: “This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail.
But just like the civil rights movements and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will be performing at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to block Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
The Washington Examiner quoted U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke as saying that Washington could mobilize its navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleges that Russia’s involvement in Syria — more notably at the invitation of the legitimate government — is just an excuse to explore new energy markets.
According to the report, he said: “I believe that the reason they entered the Middle East was because they wanted to trade in energy as in Eastern Europe, the southern depression of Europe.”
And according to official reports, there are many ways and measures to prevent this.
“The U.S. has the ability to use its navy to ensure that shipping lanes remain open and will close, when necessary, to ensure that their energy sources are not brought into the market,” he said.
Zinke has urged attendees to attend an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that the two approaches were equally effective.
“The economic option that Iran and Russia can choose is to take advantage of and change the type of fuel,” he said, while calling Russia a “only one strength” with an economy that relies solely on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration is seeking to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 oil project, which, according to Trump, has left Moscow “fully in control” of Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil and gas project, built to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s stiff opposition to the project simply stems from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and consumers have to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance sparked a backlash from Germany, which later reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s top industrial organization, the German Industrial Confederation (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the European Union’s energy policy, as well as bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I face a big problem when there is a third country trying to interfere with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Confederation (BDI), said after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" 2020 presidential run, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
The Hill quoted her as saying, “It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix government errors, and thus need a woman at the top.”
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during a town hall meeting and said he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m really worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been critical of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said “of course the FBI must investigate before voting.”
But a poll on Thursday found that a majority of Warren’s voters did not think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Center for Political Studies, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters “possibly” think the senator should not run for office.
Thirty-two percent supported her candidacy.
The poll showed more voters backing former Governor Deval Patrick to run for office, with 38% of voters backing and 48% opposed.
Other potential Democratic candidates named when it comes to the 2020 presidential race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make a formal decision before January.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) syndrome at Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged in a case of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back, I can totally relate to other families who are also suffering the consequences of PTSD and the trauma that our soldiers bring back,” she told a crowd at the Donald Trump campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his son's arrest "an obvious issue but nobody wants to mention" and said her son and the other veterans returning from the war "had more change, more thorny, and wondered if there was any respect for them and their comrades, the air force and every other member of the military for what they had done for this country."
According to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assaulting domestic violence against a woman, preventing others from reporting domestic violence and possessing a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states and D.C. support challenge to new refugee policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are in support of challenging the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives of 18 states and D.C. sent a brief collective text Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers opposed to the policy.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace and Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has yet to be disclosed.
She said her lover "and the sons of his violent gang members" abused her but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors of the pro-Grace states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum-seekers in the U.S. are at a time when countries face widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy runs counter to a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Council that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades-old state, federal and international legal systems.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered based on the specific facts and circumstances of the requester and this obstruction policy violates that principle,” the brief document said.
Prosecutors also argued in the brief document that the immigration denial policy harms the U.S. economy, because immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide adequate resources of necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked immigration attorneys not to continue allowing asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse in June.
“Only allow asylum for people who leave their countries because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a policy statement on June 11.
Asylum is never a measure of mitigating all the problems — even all the serious ones — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race for survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dire.
“It’s really stressful,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she patted her fevered son at an evacuation center in the desperate city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
People returned to their destroyed homes, picking up things flooded in the water, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were completely overcrowded, after damage from the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Several people were injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulders lying outside Palu Army Hospital. Here the patient was treated outdoors due to the strong aftershocks that continued.
Tears poured out as he recalled the feeling of the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“We don’t have enough time to save ourselves.
I think I was thrown into the ruins of the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the town to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry and cry for help, but then I didn’t hear anything.
I don’t know what happened to my daughter.
I hope they are all safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Bullying’ With ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper addressing the common interests of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press for propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned an additional sum of money from China Daily for the Des Moines Register — Iowa state’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is seeking to interfere in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington’s intensifying campaign to pressure China, according to what U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place ads promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in an escalating trade war, with evidence that they have imposed high tariffs on their imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s tariffs in retaliation in the early stages of the trade war have been designed to target exporters in pro-Trump Republican states such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, saying China "is continuing that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In a propaganda effort, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the U.S. tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Conversely, in the newspaper stalls on the streets of Beijing, you find very little dissent and you won’t see any genuine reflection on the various Chinese opinions about China’s difficult economic trajectory, because it’s clear that the media is completely under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers has shied away from an offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh's case
As many of the top Republicans defend the Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s position against several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they could face a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around this case are strong and most of the Republican candidates on the campaign list say they want to keep voting.
There are things we can’t do again,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he did not think Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) had pressed the button to allow the FBI to conduct enough investigations to appease angry voters.
Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group, said on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – tomorrow they will not forget, and in November they will not forget.”
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched through the Senate's lobby as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue voting for Kavanaugh despite Professor Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
“Enthusiasm and motivation for democracy will be pushed higher than ever,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“It is said that this momentum is now very high; yes.
But it could be even higher, especially among women in the suburbs and young voters, who are 18 to 29 years old and don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford was publicly sworn in on the details of the alleged sexual assault against the Supreme Court Justice nominee, analysts said the public could likely backfire if the Republicans continued their confirmation.
NBC News quoted former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele as saying last week: “This could become a mess that Republicans have to deal with.”
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the official vote, or whether Kavanaugh will become a Supreme Court Justice, it’s more important how Republicans handle the appeal this time around and how they treat the accuser,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a campaign group that supports Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans who disagree about whether to trust Ford or Kavanaugh’s testimony seem to be more skeptical of Kavanaugh.
A new poll conducted by YouGov found that 41 percent of respondents said they were certain or could trust Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they were certain or could trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents thought Kavanaugh may or may not have lied when giving testimony, while only 30% said Ford was sure or probably lied.
After Flake pressed the consensual button, the FBI was investigating Ford’s allegations and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford took an oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk, when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court Justice candidate of exposing his genitals in front of her when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start building new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is now launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend is called Inrupt, a construction company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and what permissions people are given to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to “dominate the world.”
“We have to start now,” he said of the startup project.
"Now is the moment of history."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows users to create their own "online personal data storage" or POD.
This data warehouse can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, personal and other professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all are available in one browser and display simultaneously.
What is unique about this online personal data repository is that the user has the sole right to decide who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it “giving control of data to individuals.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of the Inrupt project is to make sure the company has the right resources, processes, and skills to help deliver Solid to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that has been acquired by IBM, several developers who have contracted to work under the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not discuss with "Facebook and Google whether or not a radical change will occur because all of their business models can be fully upgraded overnight.
“We don’t need their permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Association at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential name in the debate over internet neutrality.
Despite launching the Inrupt project, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” adds Berners-Lee.
Cleric Bernard Vann received the Order of the Victoria Cross during World War 1
The centenary of the Church of England's sole cleric who was awarded the Order of the Cross of Queen Victoria during World War I as a warrior was held in his hometown.
Reverend Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he died of sniping four days later and never knew he had won the highest military honor.
On Saturday, two of his nephews revealed a commemorative stone during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the nephews, Michael Vann, said it was a "brilliant symbol" when the stone was displayed exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann commanded his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog, under heavy fire from rifles and machine guns."
He then plunged into the bullets and, with "great courage", led the battalion above, before plunging into a rifleman and taking down three commandos.
Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “acts that I myself could never do, but there was humility there.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath after the leading Brentwood Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he felt "extremely honored to be part of the parade" and that "the bravery of a true hero will be credited with the support of so many people."
Martial Arts Fans Wake Up All Night to Watch Bellator 206, But Eventually They Only Get Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve been up all night waiting to see Bellator 206 with its crowded stands, but have been denied access to the main event.
The show's introduction from San Jose said there were 13 fights, including six on the main card and was shown live throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the viewers in England were stunned when the screen turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel disrespected after they wake up near the end of the morning to watch the game.
One fan expressed on Twitter that turning the show into a children’s cartoon was like “an ungrateful joke.”
“The government stipulates that martial arts content shown at 6 a.m. is inappropriate, so they have to be turned into a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the transfer.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator Company president Scott Coker said it was reviewing the broadcast schedule to ensure British audiences could watch the show in the future.
Mr. Coker said, “I think if we play it again, we can solve the problem.”
“But on that side it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday and we can’t handle it until Sunday in our time zone, but Monday in their time zone.
But we are trying to find a solution.
Trust me, when people switch programs, there's a lot of text messages and they're not very friendly.
We tried to fix it, which we initially assumed was due to a technical malfunction.
But in the end, it’s not that, it’s government regulation.
I can promise you this won’t happen next time.
We’re going to reduce the number of matches to five, instead of six as originally expected – five is the number of matches we normally offer and we’ve tried to provide excess for the fans.
This is really an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'lost' about sexual orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says that when he grows up, he always feels inferior to others because of his sexual orientation – but that’s what drives him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize “I’m like no other” until he studied in school.
Speaking on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs show, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he has spoken out about the rights of gay men to bring “hope” to others.
He also said being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off to recover.
In the first issue led by Laverne, Daley appears as an outcast, saying he feels "lost" by everyone, because "his gender is not socially accepted as obviously sons and daughters."
To this day, the feeling of being inferior and different still exists, becoming my motivation and strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he had “something accomplished” so that people wouldn’t be disappointed when they learned the truth about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an active campaigner for the LGBT community and he used his image at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to fight discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke up because he felt very lucky to be able to live openly without discrimination and wanted to bring "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion shared that he fell in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black. The two met in 2013 and "surprisingly fell in love."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age gap has never been a hindrance between the two.
“When you go through so much suffering as a child,” he said at the Olympic Games when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who’s going through the ups and downs of his life.”
The couple became parents to Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said his “worldview” had changed.
“If you asked me last year my goal was ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
"But you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert. He died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was dying and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that ‘he can’t sit in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held his hand as he took his last breath, and even when he stopped breathing and died forever, I finally couldn’t admit that he had to be invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew it was my whole life’s dream – jumping a bridge in front of a crowd of fans at the Olympic Games, there really isn’t a better feeling than that,” he said.
It also inspired him to pick his first song – Heather Small’s Proud – which accompanied him in training towards the Olympic Games and still touched him every time he listened.

Mickelson missed out on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday for playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to improve his form to avoid the record becoming a sad experience.
Mickelson played in the biennial event 12 times but captain Jim Furyk left him on the bench in Saturday's fourball and foursome series.
Instead of being the center of action in the U.S., the five-time winner has to spend the day as a cheerleader and play the game in the hopes of getting rid of the discomfort.
The 48-year-old with the knack of hitting on the plane has never been an ideal choice for the cramped Le Golf National course, even when he’s at the top of his form, because the wrong shots here will have heavy consequences.
And if the golf course is not haunting enough, Mickelson also has to play on Sunday 9th match against UK Open champion Francesco Molinari. This week, Molinari teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games.
If the U.S. team, currently losing 4 points before the start of the series of 12 singles matches want to start impressively, then Mickelson’s match is paramount.
Furyk expressed confidence in his players and didn’t talk too much.
"He understood his role very well today, he patted me on the back, put his arms around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He is a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, in the past and throughout this week.
I never imagined he would play two games.
I imagine a lot more, but that’s how things go and we think that’s the right path.
He wants to play, like all his teammates.”
This Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record, becoming the most-matched player in the Ryder Cup.
That could also be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup because the peaks of his personal record have never been in this tournament.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and a draw, although Furyk argued that his presence brought intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people. Having him in the group is really fun," he explains.
"I think the young players were happy to see him and this week was quite fun.
What he has done is more than fighting.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, had the experience that even if his team had a lot of lead when entering the singles matches at the end of the Ryder Cup season, the results could still be easily reversed in an unpleasant way.
The Dane began playing in 1997 in Valderrama, in which their team, led by Seve Ballesteros, was five points ahead of the U.S. team but ended up winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You always have to remind yourself that we’ve been ahead a lot in Valderrama; we’ve been ahead a lot at Brookline and we’ve lost, in Valderrama, we win, but we’re struggling,” Bjorn said, with his face pictured after watching the Class of 2018 game with a 5-3 win on Friday and a 10-6 lead yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that that's not the end.
You still have to be mentally focused tomorrow.
Going to the field and playing well.
The tournament is not over when the score is not on the table.
“We have a goal to win the trophy this year and that’s our focus.
I always say I’m focused on my 12 players, but we also know the strength of your team – they’re the best players in the world.”
Excited by the performance of his golfers on the bumpy golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never say anything.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow is a personal event and it will be very different.
It would be great to play in pairs and everything would go smoothly. But when you play individually, all the possibilities of a player will be revealed.
That’s the message you have to share with every player, that they have to be ready to play their best tomorrow.
Now a pair has to separate and each one has to be ready to play the best.”
In contrast to Bjorn, his opponent's captain, Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than when playing in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself, who had gone through both directions during major turning points on the last day, had been a member of the winning team at Brookline before the defeat while the European team was hailed as the "Miracle in Medinah."
"I memorize every word," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the team's captain in 1999, had assembled and encouraged the players before the final day.
“We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you’re going to want to start as quickly as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medinah.
When the results are following a trend, the matches in the middle will be under a lot of pressure.
We build the squad that way and send players out strategically and try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with leading the team and facing Rory McIlroy in the top-flight match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the first series.
"I chose this group, in that order because I believe it's the way to get through," Bjorn said of his selection for the singles match.
New German warships are still being put into service.
The latest German Navy destroyer should have been tested in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warship, but it should be tested at least next year due to system failure and rising costs.
Die Zeit quoted a military spokesman as saying: “Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg destroyer, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.”
The ship was supposed to have been delivered to the Navy in 2014, but the trouble after delivery hampered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class destroyers.
This means that these ships will be armed with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic trail reductions.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the ability to deploy the latest destroyers far from national ports for up to two years.
However, the continuous delay means that these modern warships – which are supposed to help Germany control outside countries – will become obsolete at the start of use, Die Zeit noted.
The unlucky F125 became a headline last year when the German Navy officially refused to test the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reason behind the ship's return, but German media mentions "serious software and hardware flaws", leading to the ship being completely useless if engaged in combat missions.
The software flaw was particularly serious because the Baden-Wuerttemberg would be operated by a fleet of 120 sailors – only half the manpower on the old Bremen-class destroyer.
At the same time, it can be seen that the ship's weight increased significantly, resulting in reduced performance and limiting the Navy's future upgrade capabilities.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice the weight of the same warship that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is also a serious problem.
The project is said to have substantial capital of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – while the initial estimated cost was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The issue of mobilization of the latest destroyer has become particularly important, amid recent warnings about Germany’s shrinking naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the navy actually "lacked warships capable of combat."
The official said the problem was getting worse over time, because the old ship had been decommissioned but there were no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships were eligible to join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study is underway at a site in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use natural landscapes to hunt for food.
It is hoped that these findings will shed light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and guide future conservation activities.
The study, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, tracked the journey of common bats, soprano pipistrelles, brown-eared bats, and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be located in key locations around the research site to monitor the activity of these bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The audio analyst will analyze all the recordings and determine the sound frequency of the bat and the purpose of each particular bat limb.
Subsequently, maps and reports of bat habitats will be made to have a detailed picture of the natural landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will help determine which habitats play the most important role for bats and how each species lives in that environment.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management activities of organisms, such as prairie planting and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect the bat's bean rig and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and light systems, fly trap paper, some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as pet cat attacks can also pose a risk to bats.
Bats are not completely blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, the ears are more helpful than the eyes when stalking and catching prey.
They use a highly sophisticated echolocation technique to identify obstacles in flight.
NTS is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, while taking bats particularly seriously.
The organization has ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, test and sometimes participate in animal rescue.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Land manager David Thompson said the land was their ideal territory.
“Threave is a great habitat for bats,” he says.
“We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of big trees and good habitat.
But there’s still a lot of mystery about bats, so working here and at other facilities will help us better understand what bats need to grow further.”
He stressed the importance of checking the life of bats before preserving them in land parcels, because accidentally destroying their breeding rigs could kill up to 400 females and vomiting offspring, almost completely destroying the population.
Bats are protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their bean rigs.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the community to participate in helping.
“We still need to learn more about bats, and for many species, we don’t know how far apart their populations are.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and his lawyer prepares to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said sexual accusations against him were "fake news" and someone "wanted to take advantage" of his name.
His lawyer is prepared to sue the German daily Der Spiegel for publishing the allegations.
The Portuguese striker who plays for Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in his Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the player allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
In a live video on Instagram to 142 million followers hours after the allegations were announced, Ronaldo, 33, claimed the report was "fake news".
"No, no, no.
What they say today is all fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner said in front of the camera.
“They want to take advantage of my name.
That's normal.
Say my name, they are famous, but that’s just part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything’s fine,” the player added and smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they called “unacceptable suspicions about private life”.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which may be one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years.”
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at a high-end lounge at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's lounge. According to records filed in Clark County Court, Nevada, he allegedly raped her at the hotel.
Mayorga said Ronaldo was on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99%" a "good guy", with only "1%" not good.
It is documented that Ronaldo has confirmed that the two parties had sexual intercourse, but based on consensus.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and was photographed of the wounds at the hospital, but later agreed to mediate outside the courts because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried because she was "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old said she is now seeking to overturn her previous settlement decision because she continues to suffer from the trauma caused by the alleged incident.
At the time of the allegations, Ronaldo was preparing to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but eventually this summer he switched to playing for the Italian giants Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million transfer deal.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing its position as car maker
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK “will forever regret” losing its global leadership in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He added that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the European Union without further agreement, it will stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 units last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK completely leaves the European Union by the end of March, then we will have to stop production at this plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have also raised concerns about Britain leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of automakers is the supply chain risk in the event of a Brexit without another deal.
Toyota's production line operates on the "just-in-time" principle, with parts delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers in the UK and the European Union for cars made on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without another deal on March 29, there could be a potential disruption at the border and the sector fears it could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
Toyota said it could not keep inventory value for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, so it would have to stop production.
Clark said Prime Minister Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future ties with the European Union would be “precisely adjusted to avoid border checks.”
"We need to make a deal. We want to make the best deal, not only to ensure success in the present, but also to make sure we seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“Evidence from Toyota as well as other automakers shows that we need to ensure continued supply chain success.”
Toyota hasn't said for how long it will shut down production, but in the long term, it warned that the extra cost would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually, workers would lose their jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and who convened the Unite trade union at the factory, said his members were increasingly worried: “In my experience, once I lose these jobs, it’s never going to happen again.
A government spokesman said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
White House announces meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House announced on Sunday that Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “back for another week” as the fight over Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the case of interference in the Russian election, links between the aides of President Trump and Russia and the possibility of the President obstructing the enforcement of justice.
Whether Trump fired the deputy attorney general, which entailed Mueller’s impossibility to operate independently, has fuelled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing headphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein declined to report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid speculation that he was about to resign.
Instead, his meeting with President Trump, who was visiting the United Nations General Assembly in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "didn't want" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing between Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse who testified.
On Friday, President Trump asked the FBI to spend a week investigating the allegations against Kavanaugh, while continuing to delay the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "The date of the meeting has not been set, possibly this week, so it is possible to see the reason for this postponement is because of other issues taking place in the Supreme Court.
“But we will get the news soon and the press will be updated.”
Some reporters may disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the absence of press conferences was not because she didn’t like television reporters “too much talk,” though she said: “I also agree that reporters are a lot of things.”
She then suggested increasing the direct link between President Trump and the press.
“The president is now doing more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president,” she added, without citing evidence: “We’ve looked at the number of press conferences.”
Sanders said there would still be press conferences but "if the press had a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, that would be much better than talking to me.
“We’ve tried a lot and you see we’ve had a lot of work to do over the last few weeks, which will replace a press conference when you can speak directly to the president of the United States.”
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or during press conferences when officials visit.
Press conferences are very rare.
This week, in New York, the president was supposed to declare the reason, but he appeared suddenly in a strange way in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Minister writes letter to European Union staff working in health care in Scotland to talk about fear of Brexit
The health minister has written to staff of the European Union working in the health sector in Scotland to express the nation’s gratitude and desire for staff to remain in post-Brexit.
Health Minister Jeane Freeman sent a letter with a message that would resign within six months of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government is committed to supporting the cost of applications certifying the residency status of citizens of the European Union who are working in the transferred public service sector.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Throughout this summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union continue, which is expected to be made this fall.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible failure to reach an agreement.
I know this is an uncertain time for all of you.
That’s why I want to reiterate that I now appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Furthermore, colleagues from the European Union have brought valuable experience and skills to help strengthen and improve health services, while benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we look forward to your stay.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee Tigers forward Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee-based Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened just before the half-time break.
“He ran toward the edge and collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen at the vertical edge before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further tests.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added "there are no details on the extent/type of injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year Red Shirt student, first played under the Tennessee shirt after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five matches on Saturday before being eliminated from the game and he has a total of 18 games this season.
Foreigners who buy real estate in the UK will be taxed higher
Foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be taxed more, the extra money will be used to help the homeless under Tory's new policies.
This change will nullify success in Corbyn’s effort to attract young voters
The tax increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department expects the policy to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year – to help the homeless
Foreigners who buy real estate in the UK will be taxed more - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Prime Minister Theresa May will announce today.
The change will effectively nullify Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract younger voters with a commitment to provide cheaper housing and target high-income audiences.
The tax increase will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, which will boost the government’s efforts to combat stagnation.
The surcharge – in addition to the current tariffs, including the higher taxes announced two years ago on second homes and homes bought just for that – could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury Department expects this change to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120m per year.
An estimated 13% of the newly built London property has been sold to non-British citizens, which has pushed home prices higher and made it increasingly difficult for first-time homebuyers.
Many of the country’s wealthy areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” as the majority of expats who buy homes spend most of their time in other countries.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to give more young people a chance to own their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking land but not using it, urging May to abandon quotas for affordable homes in order to remedy Britain’s “housing problem.”
Corbyn also announced a series of housing reforms aimed at attracting voters, including controlling rents and ending "bug-free" deportations.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
She said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my term to restoring the British dream – that life would be better for the next generation.
And that means we have to regulate the very chaotic housing market now.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, this doesn’t mean that people who don’t live in the UK and companies based abroad can easily buy homes like hardworking British residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of owning a home has become too far-fetched and the stagnation is still huge.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "ultimate ambition" was to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
Scot, 42, is facing the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which currently holds third place in League One, three points behind first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I want to play for my country as a player.
I had the hat with the B logo and that’s what I wanted,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“My childhood years have been linked to those Scottish games in Hampden with my father, and that’s what I always remember.
However, that opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing the club.”
Sunderland's predecessors to Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Athletic coach Alloa said he did not feel pressured to be a successor after the big names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at the moment will be judged by ‘can I bring the club back to the Premier League?’
The structure and facilities at this club certainly belong to the Premier League,” he said.
"It's not a task to achieve easily, but I only consider myself a success if I can bring the club back to the league."
Ross spent three years as a manager, after a stint as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to restore his position after relegation to third place, and brought St Mirren from the risk of relegation to the championship the following season.
Ross says he feels very comfortable during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academia.
"It's probably a real turning point," he recalls as Alloa's lead.
“I really believe that I am more suited for a managerial role than a player.
This sounds strange because I have been quite successful, got a good income and achieved certain achievements as a player.
But the game is usually not easy.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still have to endure the stress and pressure of the job but I am satisfied with the management job.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m doing it, I’m most comfortable being myself throughout my adult life.”

The summer heatwave has increased sales for struggling pubs in the UK but has put additional pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the figures, pubs and bars saw revenue rise by 2.7% in July – but sales at restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA, a consulting firm, said: “The long wind and England’s innings at the World Cup made July’s sales trend similar to June’s, when pubs increased by 2.8%, and restaurants were more affected.
Revenue at restaurants fell 1.8 percent in June and worsened in July.
Pubs and bars specializing in beverages have the fastest growth when compared to the decline in restaurants.
Food pubs are also affected by the heat, though not as severe as restaurants.
Everyone seems to just want to drink.
Beverage sales at managed pubs and bars rose 6.6 percent in the month while food sales fell 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM hospitality and entertainment industry analyst, said: “These results reflect the trends we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to revenue at restaurants.
Unsurprisingly, restaurants continued to struggle, with sales down 4.8 percent year-on-year while cost pressures steadily increased.
“The long, sunny summer has come at its worst for food vendors, not knowing if in August when the weather is cooler could improve the current situation.”
Total revenue growth in pubs and restaurants, including new locations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand implementation.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s sales supervisor for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK collected and analyzed data on performance from 47 active groups, with combined sales of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and that’s the industry benchmark.
One in five kids have secret social media accounts that parents don’t know about
One in five children – some aged 11 – have secret social media accounts that parents and teachers don’t know about, the survey shows
A survey of 20,000 middle school students found that the number of “virtual Insta” pages has increased significantly.
The news has raised concerns about the rise of pornography online.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account to show to parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed rapid growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they use a “main” account that doesn’t have bad content to show to their parents, and they also have their own account.
A mother stumbled upon the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter and saw a teenager calling on others to “rape me.”
According to a study by the UK Digital Content Awareness Society and the HMC in private schools, 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admit to having their own accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the representative of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual meeting.
Doyle is the most medal-winning athlete in Scotland, and president Ian Beattie sees the change as a great opportunity for sports coaches to use her extensive experience in international competitions over the past decade.
“Eilidh is very respected in the Scottish athletics community, in the UK and around the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by electing her to the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to act as a representative of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland.
An American, who once won the 200-meter and 400-meter gold medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, he has all four Olympic gold medals and he is now a permanent BBC commentator, has been unable to walk after experiencing a slight stroke.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I can't go.
Doctors say only time will tell if I will recover or if I will be in any condition.
It was a tiring journey but in order to fully recover, I learned how to walk again and now I can walk fast!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Milk pump ads comparing mothers to dairy cows divide public opinion online
A company specializing in milk pumps diverged online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to milked cows.
To mark the launch of the product deemed “the world’s first wearable and noise-free suction machine,” consumer technology company Elvie launched a satirical music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the new suction machine gives mothers.
Four mothers danced in a coop filled with hay in a song that sang, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails and in case you don't realize, these aren't my breasts, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Suck out, suck out, I’m feeding the kids, suck out, suck out, I’m milking my girls.”
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a lot of controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying that the ads underestimate the “terror” of the dairy industry.
“It was a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to babies to produce milk, except that cows are robbed of their mothers within a few days of giving birth.”

Another commented: “This can be psychologically damaging to both the mother and the baby.
That’s right, why not use it to advertise pumps for breastfeeding mothers?”
Another commented, “This ad has nothing to do with it.”
There were people who also defended the ad, one woman admitted that she found the song "funny".
“I think this is a unique idea.
I’ll buy myself one if I still breastfeed.
Smoking really made me feel like a cow.
This ad is a bit crazy but I understand its message.
This is a unique product,” another commented.
Another commented: “This is an interesting ad aimed at mothers who need to suck milk (usually at work or in the toilet) and who feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that praises or evaluates the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women revealed that they were dancing with a milk pump hidden in their underwear.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women who suck milk for breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump makes no noise, has no wires or tubes and sits discreetly inside the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, carry babies, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is truly a revolutionary product that deserves a bold introduction and encourages curiosity.
When comparing women to dairy cows, we want people to know about dairy products and their associated challenges, and to express in a fun and empathetic way the freedom that new dairy products bring to mothers.
This isn’t the first time the Elvie pump has appeared in newspaper headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in detention has spiked even though the number of people crossing the border monthly has remained largely unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh arguments and policies have made the process of bringing children to donors even more difficult.
Traditionally, most donors used to be undocumented immigrants, and they were concerned that accepting an immigrant child could jeopardize their ability to stay in the United States.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential donors and other adult members of their families would have to take their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of applicants for sponsorship for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of donors or family members are here illegally, and most of them have criminal records.
So we are continuing to try these individuals,” Albence said.
According to staff working in the camps, to be able to quickly handle cases involving these children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some donors to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, as previously standard.
Many will appear through a video conference call, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are tried are deemed ineligible for sponsorship will be promptly deported.
The longer children are detained, the more anxious or depressed they become, which can lead to violent behavior or attempts to escape, according to staff at refugee camps and according to reports from the system in recent months.
Supporters said growing concern at a larger facility like Tornillo, where they see a struggling child more likely to be ignored due to the camp’s size being too large.
They added that sending children to a city with a refugee camp without giving them enough time to prepare or to say goodbye to friends can be psychologically damaging to many of them.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw from the country immediately
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the civil war entering its eighth year.
Moualem, the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, in the name of counter-terrorism forces, so "will be dealt with".
“They must withdraw from Syria unconditionally and immediately,” he said before the council.
Moualem stressed that “the war on terror in Syria is nearing its end,” with more than 360,000 people dead since 2011, with millions displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this jihad until we purge terrorist groups from the entire territory of Syria” and “the illegal presence of foreign forces.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specializing in training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 infantry in the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said the country’s conditions were good enough for them to return, and he blamed “some Western countries” for sowing “irrational fears” that prevented refugees from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to create conditions for the return of refugees," he said.
“They are using political cards for humanitarian issues.”
The United States and the European Union have warned there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last rebel zone of Idlib had created an opportunity to accelerate political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces into the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee consisting of the government and members of the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's work was limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interfering in elections.
Why Trump will win a second term
Logically, President Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless the impeachment process and scandals result in an impeachment termination of the presidency ahead of time, as liberals are hoping.
This is obviously the “most drama of a presidency!”
So far, there have been no signs of cooling down.
Since 2014, viewership at Golden Hour has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News now has 2.4 million viewers at golden hour, compared to 1.7 million viewers from four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” topped the cable TV charts with more than 3.5 million viewers on the main newsfeeds.
“Although they don’t understand it, many people are drawn to it like body-slaughters,” said Neal Baer, who runs ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” a cabinet secretary who became president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: and Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She recalled her taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
You asked why?
“He said, ‘Because he made me laugh,’” Miss Scovell told me.
This is an interesting thing in the context of chaos.
Of course, unlike what happens on TV, any move by Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or the reunion of immigrant families and the global economy.
Only some television viewers have the privilege of choosing their own channels.
Not only that, but this is even more appealing than the news section when you spend six hours watching a group of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "in-depth" information in his book Fear, or Paul Manafort's $15,000 Emu-feathered bomber jacket ("a showy outfit," the Washington Post writes) and the implications of the overshoots.
I changed my mind about Super Mario.
“One of the things he does is always bring you something new every night that makes it look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars” when it comes to the cast and surprises on Trump’s daily TV show (such as waging a war against N.F.L. or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t miss an episode or you won’t catch up with the trend.
This week I had a conversation with Fleischs, outside the house on the north bank of Kauai under 80 degrees heat, but he hid in his house to watch MSNBC while filming for CNN.
He can’t leave the television screen especially when Brett Kavanaugh is on trial before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is on the table.
“I remember the days when we made those crazy programs and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside poured into the most intense midterm elections for the race to the White House.
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency is witnessing a rain of cash, as a rearrangement of the congressional district has prompted the two incumbents to run for the same seat.
The recent geopolitical rearrangement in Pittsburgh County knocked out Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which shares multiple boundaries with the new 17th district.
The cadastral map was re-engineered after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that old counties were rigged in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has become a financial race between the party's main sponsor organizations, the Democratic Committee on the Congressional Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican Committee on the National Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb was a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the highly-watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th District Congressional District.
The position has been Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators have rated the Democrats higher.
The U.S. was considering sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China, but later pulled back.
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing, and Washington hardly raised any objections.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and the president once owned a hotel in Panama until business partners fired the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions on the non-recognition of Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman said in a statement earlier this month.
But the punishment is only considered for El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, including cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions for some, would cost the Central American country that currently has high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings are underway, North and Central American officials have postponed a security and economic-focused summit to reorganize a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials had announced that they wanted to continue to conduct the conference, helping to end the sanctions considerations against El Salvador by the United States.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, when there is a signal to take administrative measures.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no hard message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their information was corroborated by an outside analyst with close ties to the authorities and also spoke anonymously.
Research History
The next bomb could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on President Trump’s obstruction of justice, which now has a lot of evidence in public records.
It is thought that Mueller is shifting his investigation to Trump’s collusion with Russia in the presidential election.
If there’s a party change in Congress, Trump will have a tough time in Congress, right before the time for the campaign to win voters, and even with people in the same party.
There are a lot of issues, I don’t mean that President Trump’s departure is inevitable — just like his counterparts in Europe.
Both sides of the Atlantic need to make choices, and this will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if the West also agreed against and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to escape the years of carnage.
History revolves around such milestones, and the uncompromising struggles of the democratic party will either increase or delay.
Americans have to deal with some of these problems.
What if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been sitting in the fire since reports last year that he had secretly proposed eavesdropping on the president and speculation about his inadequacy.
Rosenstein claims that the Times report is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the F.B.I.’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair – or if he confirms with the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
On top of that, will we vote midterm for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will lose power for a long time.
But I believe that we will not fail, because I have learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that had occupied our home.
She survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, gave me the opportunity to light candles on the altar on the Sabbath.
With my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans's optimism ahead of Rapid Vienna clash
Rangers played against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would give them the advantage to qualify for the Europa League Group G round.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better things.
"It's a good thing for us because Villarreal are a strong team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with confidence that we would win a point.
We could have won at the end of the game, but the draw was not a bad result.
They may have played better in the first half but we countered in the second half and were in better form.
Thursday is going to be a big game in Europe.
“Hopefully we can get the three points but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the previous match, but with the support of the fans, I’m sure we can get through and win a good result.
“Last year was a difficult period, I was injured and the changes at the club but now I have a very good feeling.
The team is good, the players are in good form and the training quality is good.
“Hopefully we can continue to go deeper to achieve a successful new season.”
Women Are Worried to Lose Sleep Because of Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear understanding of what they were interested in, few spoke with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about this,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business at Nationwide.
Here are the steps to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t mentally prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes first.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss the location and how you will be cared for, as those options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a payment method for those costs.
Your financing options for long-term care purposes may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-worthy life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or purchasing insurance with your own money — as long as you have the money.
Carefully prepare legal documents: Avoid possible legal battles.
There is a health care plan available so you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee the medical care process and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider authorizing your financial accounts.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure to pay your bills if you can’t afford it.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
List those details so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about doctors?” asked Martin.
“What kinds of drugs are there?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have you made a plan?”
The man who fired multiple shots with a rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a rifle on his way home during the night.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arms.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "spontaneous act."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injury was not life-threatening and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll was expected to rise.
Contact was cut off, and aid workers were unable to receive any information from the Donggala government, a region north of Palu near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a fjord on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a capital spanning more than 300 km (180 mi) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The capital, an administrative region administered by the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the two key sectors of the economy in Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also an important industry here, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Natural Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also made landfall in western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami to hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake strikes near the city of Padang, capital of eastern Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake strikes one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake strikes the capital Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and panic as people recall the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed as buildings collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly concentrated in the north of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a report of domestic violence and opposing an arrest warrant, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Government Police.
According to police reports, when a woman tried to call the police to report a crime invoked, he grabbed the phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su and must pay an unsecured $500 bail, according to KTUU’s report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, claiming he was “definitely not guilty” when asked to defend himself, according to the report.
Palin faces three Grade A counts, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with class B misdemeanor, jailed for one day and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently being filed in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering in reports of domestic violence, and possessing a weapon in a state of insanity related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The video being posted on social media shows the timing of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck.
Federal prosecutors are asking for the death penalty for suspected NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, crashing into pedestrians and cyclists on October 10.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily injury, according to a notice of a proposed death penalty request filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges can be sentenced to death, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of attempted murder, often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “meticulous planning and advancement,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s practices as “cruel, cruel and inhuman.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has inflicted injury, injury and loss on the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian," the court said in a statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York carried out the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "completely disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We think the decision to carry out the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence confession without the possibility of a release will only prolong the vulnerability of this event for those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to give the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say Nigel Farage must take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people” during a rally at a Conservative party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must "feel the heat" from European skeptics - because one of Prime Minister Theresa May's MPs suggested he should take responsibility for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative party supporter Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK was "out of the coalition" now if Farage was Brexit minister.
But the challenge May faces as she tries to reconcile the deep divisions between Conservative MPs, who support staying in the European Union, has joined a protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to stick to a compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, Remain Supporters and the European Union.
The allies insisted she would push ahead by trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and forcing European skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her plan and the "current turmoil".
Bone said during the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "protest the Chequers plan".
He suggested Farage should be in the Senate and be responsible for the talks with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would probably be out of the coalition now,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit but we need to oppose the Chequers plan.”
He testified to his opposition to the European Union: “We do not fight in world wars to submit to others.
We want to make our own laws.”
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the coalition is completely untrue.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the rally, telling reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Not many people support the Chequers plan, the opposition won’t vote for it, which usually doesn’t happen to our party, our activists, who are willing to call for the support of the people and vote for us in the first place.
Give up the Chequers plan and listen to the people.”
In a message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their seats as they keep their promises to the people.”
Farage said politicians must join the protests to "feel the heat" if they change the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to give up Brexit and we’re here today to say ‘we’re not going to let you do that.’
In a message to his supporters, he added: “I want the political class, who are intent on changing Brexit, to feel the heat of the current situation.
“We are mobilizing the people who have brought Brexit to victory and we will never surrender until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Remaining supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour protest in the city centre.
Some activists held up Conservative Party banners against Brexit after the group’s debut this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives about the security issues they were facing as the conference opened.
“These are the people who once told us that they can control the IT system and all the technology it provides to Canada, including the issue of borderless free trade in Ireland,” he added.
“This is totally a joke.
“Brexit is not a good thing,” he added.
Warren intends to be determined to “elect” the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be determined to "run for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future while speaking at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November, in a race against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who served as co-chairman of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
People speculate that she could take on Trump’s position in 2020.
The event, which took place Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, was her 36th meeting with voters at the town hall since President Trump took office.
One attendee asked her about her intention to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to get into politics to reform the government and to have a woman at the top."
Arrested in shooting death of LSU Sims player
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. ET TV News.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died," Sheriff Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, on Sports 247.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene, possessing a weapon, and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 1.98-meter-tall teenager who grew up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games with 10 in the official squad last season with an average playing time of 17.4 minutes, winning 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins world championship after victory over Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Bottas clearly had an advantage over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday as Mercedes remained a strong team in the season.
From the starting point, Bottas had a good start and successively surpassed Hamilton to defend his position in the first two laps and caused Vettel to fight against his own teammates.
Vettel got into the first pit and dropped Hamilton on the track again, a decisive action.
The Mercedes entered the pit behind Vettel, but Hamilton got ahead as the driver in the Ferrari was forced to slow down to avoid risk after two legs to secure third place.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the race and finished seventh at the end of the first leg on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead throughout the race without changing tires to a quick finish and overcame Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the pit in the 44th lap but was unable to speed up in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough race because Valtteri did a great job on the weekend and it was a really good driver.
In the end, the team had an excellent race to win the No. 1 and No. 2 spots," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Sen. Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's campaign because she insisted she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the Supreme Court's allegation of sexual assault in the Brett Kavanaugh case.
Speaking during the West Virginia campaign, the president did not directly target Ford’s disclosure to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed people “bad intentions and dishonesty.”
“What’s happened and what’s going on in the last days in the Senate is amazing, you can feel the anger, you can see people who are angry, ugly and upset and dishonest,” he said.
“When they look at the articles and read the leaked news, they say, ‘Oh, I’m not the one who did it.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked the news, didn't you?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document, right-- "Oh my God, what's going on?
No, no, no.
I don't make a leak."
Come on, let's wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we didn’t do that,” the president parodyed the senator’s words.
Feinstein was sent a letter by Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the information was leaked earlier in September — but Feinstein denied that her office leaked the information.
“I’m not hiding Dr. Ford’s allegations, I’m not leaking her story,” Finnstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as she asked.”
But the president seemed dissatisfied with her refusal behavior and he commented during the campaign Saturday night: “I’m going to tell you about that, it’s really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president argues that Democrats are using the allegations for her own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power in every way.
You see the meaning and the discomfort because they don’t care who they hurt, they want power and control,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars won 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the game against Dundee
Dundee Stars offset Friday's loss to Belfast Giants in the Elite League by a 5-3 win in the second leg at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two goals early thanks to the scoring of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised for the home team before Dwyer added points for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard continued to draw for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to help the team win the match.
It was the team’s third Elite League defeat by Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in a match in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth encounter between the two sides this season, and the Giants have won the previous three games.
Dwy's opening goal in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford also doubled the goal four minutes later.
In the early minutes, Sullivan helped the home team shorten the score at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the player who helped Cownie level the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first half when scoring the second goal at the end of the half.
The home team consulted and Bouchard again leveled the score with a spectacular goal in the 27th minute:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen take Dundee to the lead at the end of the second half and he scored his fifth goal for his team in the final minutes of the match.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are now resting to await their next match against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controllers sacrificed their lives to save hundreds of passengers from the quake
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are being hailed as a hero after his death to ensure that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers can take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to raged in the area and many people are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the swaying control tower because of strong winds at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
Britain stayed behind to make sure that the plane carrying Batik Air Flight 6321 figures, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the air traffic control tower because he thought it had collapsed.
Then he died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved lives, according to ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he stopped breathing before the plane reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken when we hear this news,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, a spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency said it was difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The death toll continues to rise as many bodies remain trapped under the rubble and we have not yet reached many people,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves as high as six meters have devastated Palu, where mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute there is an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to support survivors but we don’t know how the situation is there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: "I look forward to all of you working day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says there is still a man missing after plane crash
The operator of the plane that crashed in the Pacific in Micronesia said one man was missing, following earlier statements that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that, until Saturday afternoon, we could not find a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more details about passengers, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
Airlines said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all remained in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
Airline and the Navy both said the plane landed at sea shortly after leaving the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was missing an airstrip.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was at a very low altitude.
“This is a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could wade through waist-deep waters to reach emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby while repairing the wharf also helped rescue by using buoys to pick up people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Data from the aviation safety network showed 111 people died in crashes by airlines registered in the PNG network over the past two decades but none involving Air Niugini.
Analysts say the girl was burned alive the night she died.
The filing was based on Saturday's retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He demonstrated to the jury how to use the mobile record to summarize the movements of 21-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from a mobile phone number that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claims, Clarion Ledger reported.
The data showed that his cell phone was at the same location as Chambers’s while he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned him.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday and certified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "liaring because my truck was in Nashville."
Another conflicting detail is that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records show they had only known each other for about a week.
Rowlett said that occasionally after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped you out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense lawyer is expected to start closed-door debates on Sunday.
The judge said he expected a jury hearing that day.
High Breed Team: What Is Positive Hip Hop?
The trio of hip hop artists wanted to protest the genre’s negative views by incorporating positive messages into their music.
The High Breed group, from Bristol, claims hip hop has ceased to convey political messages and address social issues.
The group wanted to bring the genre back to its true origins and popularize positive hip hop music.
Recently artists such as the Fugees Group and Common have gained a better reputation in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
NY teen sues couple who fired her after 'racist' text message
A New York nanny sued a couple who fired her for discrimination after she received a mistaken message from her mother complaining that she was “a black person.”
The couple rejected them as racists, treating the lawsuit as a “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed depression when she discovered her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day at work in 2016.
“NO, NO, ON THE OTHER BLACK PERSON,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the confusion, Plasco-Flaxman "annoyed" her firing Maurice, who said that the African-born nanny was about to quit had done a bad job and that she hoped to have a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice gets paid a day’s wages and goes to Uber herself.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple to seek compensation for their firing with $350 a day over a six-month period for the job she was hired to receive money even though they didn’t sign any contracts.
“I want to show them, look, you can’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple objected to allegations that they were racists, saying it was justified to terminate Maurice's work out of fear that they could not trust her after having insulted her.
“My wife sent her a message she wasn’t going to send.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But can you give your child to someone you have offended, even by mistake?
What about the newborn baby?
Please tell me."
When comparing the case to a "blackmail" case, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
“How would you deal with such a person?
This is not a good thing to do,” the investment banker added.
While legal proceedings were taking place, public opinion quickly pointed to the couple on social media, denigrating their behavior and the logic of the story.
Paddington fears that readers won’t care about the story of a talking bear, the letter says.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was widely accepted by readers, the letter reveals: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone else’s shoes when you read the book that was first published.
It’s amazing that we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
When talking about his father, a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children’s book from a little toy bear, he was still optimistic when his work was rejected, she added in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication, which was a “mixed delight” after his death last year.
When talking about Paddington, she described it as “a very important member of our family,” adding that her father had always been quietly proud of his success.
“He’s a pretty quiet man, and he’s not an aggressive man,” she said.
“But because Paddington really existed for him, it’s almost like having a child and he’s already had some success: you’re proud of them even if they don’t really exist.
I think you've seen Paddington's work that way.
Even though it was a product of his creativity and imagination, he always held a place for Paddington.”
My daughter passed away and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
As soon as she landed her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“I call Nad often to say it’s bad and she shouldn’t have been,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying she would stop breathing for two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll see you soon.
I will always be with you.
The doctors pumped the heart medicine and slowly pulled the tube out of her body.
She stopped breathing a few times and this was the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was not over.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because I was with my family and everyone else.
I have to be the one who unites them.”
Eventually Ednan-Laperouse, still grieving by her daughter’s passing, boarded the plane with the other passengers facing the challenge she would have to overcome.
“No one knows,” she said.
"I bowed my head and cried all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but when I was on the flight I felt sorry for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.”
Woman Posts Postcard to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people could call for assistance.
Ms Davis's son, 13-year-old Tyler, suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to be in a feeling that I have to go through every day,” she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with laughter.
“Everyone knows it because of the laughter.
They used to say his laughter lit up every room.”
However, he quit his job before committing suicide because he found himself "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s younger brother, who was 11 at the time, died just like his older brother after taking his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that there will be a chain reaction."
Davis designed the cards, “to let people know that there are always people you can meet, talk to, or even make friends.
Don’t live in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davies’s for many years, lost her partner Mark 15 years ago, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He’s not talking about feeling bored or frustrated or anything like that,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed he changed his attitude.
He’s bored at school on Christmas Day – when the kids open their presents and he doesn’t look at them or anything around him.”
She said her husband’s death was a huge loss for them, but they still had to try to overcome it: “This has caused a huge hole in our family.
It breaks our hearts.
But we all continue to live and fight for it.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
Flake said on Saturday that “I think if we can really get something like what you’ve asked for — a time-limited, scope-limited investigation — we can get a little bit,” adding that he fears committees will “get caught up” in partisan squabbles.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their procrastination is only a matter of time.
The midterm elections have gone through five weeks, Nov. 6 – if expected, Republicans in a bad state will be even weaker in their efforts to find the top representative they want to vote for.
George W. Bush phoned senators, lobbying to support Kavanaugh, who served as White House aide under President Bush, from which he could reach out to his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases the reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 are Republicans and 49 are Democrats.
It was not immediately clear if Kavanaugh could get at least 50 Senate votes, which allowed Mike Pence, now vice president, to remove the knot and confirm his position on the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'dramatically decreased' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors has fallen sharply since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said there were 1127 defections last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tightening controls on the border between North Korea and China and a large proportion of smugglers arrested were key factors in the change.
North Korea has not made any public comments.
Most defectors from North Korea have finally been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most defectors flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea, and they can easily pass through the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China sees defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to repatriate.
Relations between North and South Korea — technically still at war — have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on denuclearization.
The moves come after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where both sides agreed to broaden terms to move toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for causing delays in progress.
“Without any confidence on the U.S. side, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such a case, there is no other way that we will unilaterally find our own disarmament,” Ri said in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "extremist," and said he was not fit for a position on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi has called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh an "extremist" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview that took place Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help, but I think if a woman ever did that they would call it ‘extreme,’” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh insisted on denying allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were minors.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh expressed a lot of emotion, at times he was almost screaming and choking about his family and five months of high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic Party before the committee, calling the charges against him a “well-planned assassination” due to anger over Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he was unfit for the position at the Supreme Court, as he clearly demonstrated his conduct against the Democratic Party.
“I think you’ve removed yourself from your position by making statements and your treatment of the Clintons and the Democratic Party,” she said.
Pelosi declined when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democratic Party won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only will he not be on the Supreme Court, but he will have to testify in court,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s ability to make a ruling against the Affordable Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh shied away from the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“This is not the time for a person who is radical and biased in a court of law and expects us to say, ‘Isn’t that great?’” Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to take advantage of it.
This was really a heavy criticism, month after month, year after year, and she could not overcome without crying and wrestling.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me after 45 years.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, and you?”
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman, she was the senior director, she said she was crying when she was angry too but to form a reaction when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was just talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And you keep crying.
And I think this is great."
You’re allowed to cry so this behavior is part of the way out of rage because they’re basically misunderstood.
One of my deepest memories of working at my first company is that it was a men-only place, where I cried when there was an explosion of anger, when I was pulled into the stairs by an older woman — the cold manager who always scared me — who was the one who pulled me in.
She said to me, “Never let them see you cry.”
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and happy that they’re by your side.”
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race, Schroeder was deeply disappointed, arguing that there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
Thirty years later she laughed and said to me, “It wasn’t a wise decision.”
“There have been seven other candidates in the race, and they need another one.
Someone called this race "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Due to her late participation in the campaign, she lost the fundraising campaign, so she vowed that she would not run unless she raised $2 million.
The war has failed.
She discovered that some supporters gave her $250 instead of $1,000 to support the male candidate.
She asked herself, “Would they think I was discounted?”
When she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she overcame the emotion – expressing gratitude to those who had supported her, frustrated with the system that made it difficult for fundraising and targeted voters rather than delegates – that she was outraged by being sexist.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
“You thought Kleenex was the sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking about what they were going to put on my gravestone?
“Are you crying?”
U.S.-China trade war could be a good sign for Beijing
Experts say the opening ends of the trade war between the United States and China have stalled, and the war will continue, and rifts between countries could be an advantage for Beijing.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued his first warning by slapping tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The escalation has intensified in recent weeks with tariffs worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) hitting half of Chinese imports into the United States.
Beijing retaliated by raising tariffs from five to ten percent to $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to retaliate in line with U.S. action and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to be shaken soon.
Getting Washington to make concessions means Beijing has to make demands, but openly succumbing to the U.S. is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
But experts say if Beijing can come up with the right moves, the long-term pressure of the trade war with the United States could be a positive signal for China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing can start an economic relationship in either country is actually much more dangerous than previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a Asia-focused researcher at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready to let refugees voluntarily return and is calling for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the national situation is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renovate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore living conditions
All conditions are now available for the voluntary return of refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and economic conditions affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the championship when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points in defeating the US.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has participated in most tournaments, threw his shot into the water at the third shot at hole 16, admitting he lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of only four players to have won 5-0-0 since the current season started in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5 & 4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played the last Ryder Cup game of his career.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cup seasons, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the greatest champion of all competitions with a total of 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop it.
This has been a really tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing and trusting me.
I am very happy to receive the cup.
As for my team, I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said of the feeling after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"It's a great honor to be able to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up and admired him so much," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup tournaments.
Statistics of one of the greatest players of all time show that he has won 14 major trophies and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team did their best to find tickets for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who were originally highly qualified golfers of the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the players, they fought so well.
This morning we had a hard time with the high temperatures in Europe.
We were eliminated.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 players on the team played very well.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to play the PGA in the U.S. and the Ryder Cup and we’re going to go on to the top.
I love all 12 players and I am proud to be captain.
I take off my hat and say hello to you.
We played very well.”
Red Tide: Red Tide Density Decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Association shows that the density of the Red Tide has declined in much of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, algae blooms have been reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties – which causes the density of red tides to decrease.
The Red Tide phenomenon spreads for about 130 miles along the coast north of Pinellas to the south of Lee County.
Small patches were also found within 10 miles off Hillsborough County, but fewer locations than last week.
Red Tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
Average density along the coast or offshore of Pinellas County has been reported over the past week, low to high offshore density of Hillsborough County, low to high density in Manatee County, low to high density off Sarasota County, low to high density in Charlotte County, low to high density along the coast or offshore in Lee County, and low density in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in Northwest Florida over the past week.
