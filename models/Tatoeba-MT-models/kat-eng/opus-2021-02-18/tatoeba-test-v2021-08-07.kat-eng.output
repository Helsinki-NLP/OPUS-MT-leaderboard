You can go if you want.
You can go now.
It would be better not to go.
You decided.
You don't have money.
You're teasing.
You're buying me with my mother.
You have a few books.
You have your ear.
You have your ear.
You have your flesh.
You have my permission.
You have water.

Yoga!
You like elephants.
You can invite everyone who will be invited to join you.

G., United States
You're in.
You're in Europe!
You're lying to me now.
You're not a doctor.
Don't listen.
You don't have permission here.
You're sad.
You're hungry.
You're sick!
You're sad.
You're too low.
You're too low.
You're too low.
You're too low.
Nothing.
Your mother is so beautiful!
That's you!
You learn English.
You try it.
You weren't tired.
Be patient.
Be patient.
They'll never be invited to his company.
