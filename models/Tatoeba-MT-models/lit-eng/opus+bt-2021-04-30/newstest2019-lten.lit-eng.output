MG Baltic case: new lawyer says before getting to know the case
The 11th hearing of the MG Baltic case on Monday was attended by all the accused: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The hearing began with testimony from the accused.
At the last hearing, Alexander Doroshev, the new lawyer of Š. Gustavis, appointed by the state, told the judges' panel before he had access to the file.
Linas Belevičius, attorney at MG Baltic, then stated that in order to ensure a full personal defence, the panel of judges must allow the new lawyer access to the case file and requested that the hearing be postponed.
"In order to ensure a person's defence, he must have access to criminal case material.
This is not just a formal sitting," said L. Belevičius.
The new lawyer, A. Doroshev, noted that he had not been able to get to know the accused act or the entire material of the case.
In a previous trial, suspect Š. Gustaini announced that he was refusing his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard at the meeting.
Advocates of the accused resented that the audio records submitted to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, when taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions favourable to the Group in the Seimas and other state institutions, also had an impact on determining the winners of public procurement, remind ELTA.
During the pre-trial investigation more than 150 persons were interviewed, of which more than 50 were Seimas Members of the previous and this term of office, several former ministers, members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 polls and more than 30 searches were conducted.
It is suspected that Š. Gustavis received a bribe of more than 8 thousand euros, G. Steponavičius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand E. Masiulis is suspected of taking a bribe of more than 106 thousand euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade in effects, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade in effects and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade in effects of these parties.
Politicians are suspected to have negotiated bribes with Vice President of MG Baltic Group R. Kurlianskis and later offered or supported initiatives in favour of the Group at the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethical Guardians: Liberal Movement Board on the Right of Action of the Vilnius Division
"The decisions taken by the board are in accordance with the statutes," the head of the board Vytautas Tamošiūnas informed the BNS after the meeting of the commission.
"Our decision was not some new one.
We had already made a clarification as a commission in July when the issue of Pagegiai and Utena was raised.
We then said that, according to the statute, this is a matter of competence for the board.
And if the board decides that some department can do what it wants - go with the committee and the board approves of it, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then it is the decision that all divisions form party lists.
And if you don't get along with the board, then there's an opportunity to suspend membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to V. Tamošiunas, the party board will now decide on further actions.
On October 17, the Liberal Movement Board of the Party overturned the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in the municipal elections not with the list of the party, but with the new election committee.
In the opinion of the party's board, the decision of the capital's liberals to participate in elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes, decisions of the board.
By October 31, Vilnius Division had to withdraw its aspirations to participate in municipal elections with the list of the committee.
But the department didn't do it.
The former head of the division, Member of Parliament Aušrinė Armonaitė, has already withdrawn from the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, former chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, promising to seek another term as head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "Behind Vilnius, we are proud of!"
He left the party too.
Elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place in March next year.
The villagers in North India commuted a tiger with a tractor, which had previously torn one man apart, officials reported on Monday.
Forest Officer Mahavir Kaujlagi (Mahavir Kaujlagi) said that the tiger had torn a man working in the fields late on Sunday, the villagers surrounded the beast and, as the female tried to escape, commuted her with a tractor.
Residents say that this tiger attacked and draped one young man about 10 days ago as well.
The commemorative village is in the Dudhva Tigers Reserve in Lakhympur Kher District, approximately 250 km southeast of Laknau, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh.
It shall be prohibited to use tigers in protected areas.
Discipline Director Ramesh Pandey (Ramesh Pandey) said the case would be reported to police under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
In April, villagers in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh state beat another tiger; he suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is a National Animal of India; tigers are considered an endangered species under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
Last year's government figures show that at least one person was killed daily in clashes with wild tigers or elephants during the previous three years.
Human conflicts with the tigers have gradually increased since the 1970s, when India launched a program to protect the tigers, under which reserves were established in national parks, and the galabing of the big cats began to be considered a crime.
Although the methods of counting tigers have changed, the censuses would indicate that the then population of approximately 1,800 tigers had grown to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Mandatory microchip labelling is proposed for cats and dogs
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Committee on Environmental Protection of the Seimas, together with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection which propose mandatory marking of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs must be marked with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and labelling would be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be labelled free of charge with state funds, and in 2020 all cats will be marked free of charge, therefore, residents will not be bothered and costs will be covered by the specially planned state funding," said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for labelling of domestic animals.
This is expected to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal farmers, illegal multipliers or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that all owners of animals will be compensated during the transitional period on the basis of the expected average price for the provision of the chip and service, which will amount to around EUR 5.
The total cost of labelling all pets can be up to €6 million.
The need for these funds is expected to be spread over three years and will amount to €2 million per year.
It is expected that funds will be allocated to labelling programmes through the Municipal Environmental Protection Support Special Programme, whose revenues will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and redistribution of funds.
These funds will be available to municipalities not only for cat and dog labelling, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to K. Mažeika, the practice of compulsory labelling is widespread in almost all European Union countries, which allows to protect both the animals themselves (because the lost can easily be returned to the owners) and saves the time of the animal breeders themselves when the search for the escaped and lost pet takes a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only marked pets are allowed to travel.
At the same time, labelling is an obligation to take responsible care of the animal throughout its life.
Previous proposals for compulsory labelling have met with opposition, as appropriate programmes have been proposed to be financed by the population.
"The model now presented should avoid this criticism, as animal protection is proposed to be financed by increased income in the environmental support programme and the right to label not only by veterinarians but also by the public, i.e. by persons in animal care institutions who have taken special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the project's authors say.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas Members representing different parliamentary groups of the Seimas - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 members of government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
A spokesperson for the provincial governor, Arif Noori, indicated that seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four other soldiers were wounded during an attack on a joint army and police control post in the Chogyani district.
According to A. Noori, six militants were killed during a three-hour battle with Afghan forces, and ten more Talibans were wounded.
A spokesperson for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, circulated a statement to the media in which the movement assumes responsibility for Monday's attack in Ghazni province.
Mr Noori said that this post was installed two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
The post was completely destroyed during the attack.
"East" extended a helping hand to Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will be held in Vilnius "East" Arena, where Kosovo and Ukraine clubs will meet.
The duel will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius Rytas, who has a warm relationship with Ukrainian basketball, will accept Cherkaski Mavpy, Cherkasai Cherkaski Mavpy and Pristina Prishtina teams under his roof at the Arena.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were not able to host this match at home, so we are very happy that our Vilnius friends agreed to accept us," said Maxim Michelson, head coach of the Ukrainian team thanked "Tomorrow".
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always get along well.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be an honor to play here.
We hope that we will receive support from the residents of Vilnius.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine, as these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
The Ukrainian team currently ranks third after the first lap with one victory in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has a victory more.
This will be a particularly important encounter for Group E, as only two teams will enter the next phase.
In the past Vilnius has also hosted Ukraine and Kosovo national team matches in the selection for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
The 100:61 victory was then celebrated by the Ukrainian team.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the game on Wednesday for free, and duel starts at 7:00 p.m.
"Women lie better" star actress B. Arsobaite is pursued by liars
It's probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaitė already gets roles related to liars for a number of times.
Originally the series "Women Lying Better", then the performance "Melages" and finally the comedy "Melievers".
In this film, Brigita plays the square wife of the hero of Dainius Kazlauskas.
"I loved filming in the Melagai very much, because I'm more of a theatre actress and I don't appear in the cinema very rarely.
A wonderful team of colleagues gathered promised a great result from the beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was puppy Sunny!
All my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would really be big and serious.
I never admired those little, decorative "fifty" four-leggeds.
However, during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that sympathy became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the hostess, but without success," the actress smiles.
The comedic and intriguing family members' peripeties are joined from the very first minutes by the new Lithuanian comedy Melagiai, produced by Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov, the producer of Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Among Us Boys...".
Your sweetheart just reported, she's pregnant.
That would be great news, just... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Without having to announce the "good news" to everyone, the parents suddenly declare - they're different!
After 50 years together...
And all this is happening just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - Christmas!
But the end will surprise us even more, for no one expected such a respite.
All heroes aren't what they looked like at first sight...
In addition to B. Arsobaite's comedy "Melagiai" good mood will be given to the audience by four generations of film stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedy Melagiai - in the Chinese from 9 November.
Deciding to write off €100 million of unpaid taxes paid by emigrants
The Seimas on Tuesday adopted an amendment to the Residence Declaration Law prepared by Ramūnas Karbauskas, the leader of the " peasants".
56 Members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will proceed to discuss the amendments on 6 December or later, after receiving the Government's conclusion.
According to Mr Karbauskas, these fees are calculated for people who did not declare their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, in three years one person does not pay about EUR 1 000, and now there are about 100 000.
The Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would "promote a part of the people not to comply with their obligations" - declare their departure and then no taxes would be counted.
Conservative member of the Committee on Health, Antanas Matulas, noticed that Lithuanians living abroad take advantage of the fact that they come to Lithuania for treatment by paying a small health insurance fee - they are provided with the same services as the residents paying the tax.
The amendments provide that the persons who will pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation would be considered to have left Lithuania, while Sodra will have exempted them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of "Sodra" said earlier that such a step would facilitate both the lives of the emigrated people and the activities of "Sodra".
Online video of a slippery teddy bear reveals a serious problem
It is filmed as the mother bear climbs a steep snowy slope, and the baby keeps climbing, slipping down, and climbing again persistently.
The video received numerous reviews and comments.
People admired the perseverance of the little bear - repeatedly slipping down, he climbed to his mother again.
He does not succeed at the first time, but he does not even try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video really belonged to attention, but it also reveals the threat that humans pose to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
"It's obvious to me that bears are very startled by the drone.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If the drone were not flown around, they would likely have chosen a safer path or overcome it more slowly or carefully.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," ecologist Mark Ditmer said to the publication The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr Ditmer, along with his colleagues, investigated how drones affect bears.
The animals were fitted with heart work gauges.
When drones approached, some bears let themselves run away, while others did not run anywhere, but all of their hearts started to whip more often from fear.
Scientists recommend that drones be used responsibly to film animals, not to fly too close, make no noise, or fly where it is forbidden.
The runaway president was approached through a newspaper
The Kiev court on Tuesday invited Viktor Yanukovych, a deposed president who had left for Russia, to appear at a hearing of the case for the treason of his suspected state in an unusual manner - the summons were published in the state's official gazette.
In the court summons, published in the government news newspaper "Uriadovoj kurier", the former leader is invited to attend a criminal proceedings hearing on November 19, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Yanukovych has the right to attend the meeting by video.
On October 30, the Kiev court announced that it had closed the debate in the case of V. Yanukovych.
The lawyer of V. Janukovich working in Russia, Aleksandras Gorošinskis, was given the opportunity to register in the register of foreign lawyers until November 19, so that he could attend the meeting where V. Yanukovych is expected to speak his last word by video link.
Yanukovich, supported by the Kremlin, was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former leader of Ukraine had been taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year Russia annexed Ukraine-owned Crimean Peninsula, and some time later war broke out between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country.
Since then, fighting has claimed the lives of around 10,000 people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunskas will lead the list of Conservatives to Vilnius City Council
The former Minister of Economy, Parliamentarian Dainius Kreivys, had already previously been confirmed as the Conservative candidate for the year.
On the weekend, during the Conservative primary elections, the party members ranked the list of candidates for the municipal council of Vilnius city.
According to the party, the leader of the list of conservatives was V. Benkunskas, Chairman of the TS-LKD Vilnius Division Meeting.
The first ten candidates were Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Baškienė, former Seimas Member Liutauras Kazlawickas, Chairman of the Young Conservative League Mantas Benkunsk, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on March 3, next year.
Constraints of cogeneration plants appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) against the ruling of the governors to pass a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incinerators.
On Tuesday, the opposition faction of the Seimas of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of Seimas Members had appealed to the C.T. to investigate the compliance of the ruling amendments to the Waste Management Law with the Constitution.
"Parliaments stress that the provisions of the Law are intended to question the projects of waste incineration plants already in progress by entrusting the Government with the task of imposing new restrictions (20 km distance from the residential area) until the entry into force of the Law on waste incinerators started in Vilnius and Kaunas," the report says.
"Parliaments note that taking into account the way in which the law formulates a prohibition on the construction of waste management facilities of national importance (i.e. the establishment of distance and the definition of the concept of "residential territory"), it must be concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately limited or even negates the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, because the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, after assessing the density and distribution of the population of Lithuania, it would be practically impossible to build such establishments in the entire territory of the country," it adds.
The appeal states that the adopted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The C.T. has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted legal act.
In this case, the government is given the power to apply the law retroactively on the basis of an unspecified criterion.
The establishment of such a legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, protection of legitimate expectations, and hence the constitutional principle of the rule of law," the appeal states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration plants.
Stopping the current projects would not only cause hundreds of millions of financial losses to the state, huge losses to the Lithuanian population would also result in an increase in heating prices and increased environmental pollution due to the increasing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
The application to the C.T. was signed by the members from the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, the Social Democratic factions and the deputy warden of the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas was able to obtain 71 votes by the votes of those in power to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Law passed by President Dalia Grybauskaite, which provided for the right of the Government to stop the construction of cogeneration plants already started, and also established a "quarantine" zone of 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such power plants.
Amendments to the law adopted repeatedly by the Seimas will enter into force from 1 January 2019.
This proposal is planned to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the right of the Government to suspend projects already started is not planned to be abandoned.
The C.T. will deal with this case in order - no sooner than a year later.
Released a questionable statistics by LeBron James at Lakers Club
The beginning of LeBron James' career at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he expected himself, the organization and basketball fans.
The Lakers began the season with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start helped to emerge rumors over the possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, such talks were reassured by the president of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, who stated that he would not forgive the coach, but that the game should be better.
The team's biggest star, L. James, should look back on himself as well.
Although quarterback statistics are typically impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 touchdown passes.
However, she does not tell the whole truth.
During the first ten games of the season, other figures also surfaced showing that the Lakers are playing better when there is no L. James on the field.
Striker is not favored with +/- statistics showing how many more points are thrown or missed by the crew when certain players are on the field.
Here, when L. James is on the field, the Lakers missed 30 points more than the contestants in this season.
As he sat on the bench, the "lakes" scored 19 points more than the rivals.
The Lakers are currently in just 13th place at the Western Conference, but a few wins can turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian airspace protection in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania highly appreciates Spain's cooperation in NATO and its significant contribution to the security of our country and region," Minister Linkevičius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already conducted NATO Air Policing and Air Policing strengthening missions in the Baltic States on five occasions, including three times in Lithuania.
The last time Spain's Eurofighter fighters were deployed in Šiauliai during May–August of this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian airspace protection in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda are taking place between Lithuania and Spain.
Linkevičius expressed his hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to work closely together on European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is the fifth representative of Spain in Lithuania.
On October 29, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented letters of credence to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. Ačienė on the detention of R. Ačas: I believe in my husband's innocence and law enforcement
"For me, it was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, perhaps the services are doing the work they are required to do.
Each of us is doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no unfair actions by him should be done," V. Ačienė said to the BNS.
R.Ačas was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that while he was still the director of Raseiniai municipal administration, he took a bribe of high value, and in return could create exceptional conditions for a private company signing an agreement with the Raseiniai bus fleet owned by the municipality.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing Ača or of taking part in the disguise of bribes through various financial operations.
Raseiniai District Municipal Council R.Ača was dismissed from the position of head of administration by a third attempt in April of this year after a expressed lack of confidence.
In March of this year he became a member of the newly founded Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas, and on Monday he suspended membership in this party.
R. Ačas several years ago, he was unsuccessfully candidate in the mayor's election as a representative of the election committee "Your Raseiniai".
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to nominate himself in the election of the mayor of Raseiniai next year, but had not yet decided whether he would participate in the elections to municipal councils.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of the Union of Peasants and Greens, and she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she will wait for further law enforcement action, which will determine if she will get away from working in the commission.
"Sudden decisions I really don't make today, this week I think I'll make a decision.
I will see if there is a need, what kind of accusations have been made, of course, I will make some sort of decision.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - time will put everything in place," she said.
In the Seimas Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, the representative of the opposition conservatives urged the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and the head of the "states" Ramūnas Karbauskas to distance herself from the statements of the parliamentary colleague Vida Ačiene and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by transferring her to work for another Seimas committee or commission.
She claims that the continued work of V.Ačiene at the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission would "cause public mistrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervision commission".
Famous Lithuanian couples were also interested in the sensual music of Coldplay
On a autumnal Monday evening, numerous music and film lovers gathered for the pre- premiere of the film Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
The event was attended by a group of well-known people: John and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Silence, and many others.
The film tells the story of Coldplay, one of Britain's most popular post-prok groups, which intersperses with moments from concerts.
Documentary director Matt Whitecross met the band's guys even before they played in bars and gathered just a few dozen spectators.
You can see shots from behind-the-scenes, rehearsals or leisure events that have not been shown anywhere in the film.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met at college in 1996 and founded the band "Pectoralz".
They were soon joined by bassist Guy Berryman, and even later by drummer Will Champion.
The band changed their name to "Coldplay" and exactly twenty years ago released their first recording, "Safety", containing three tracks.
Of the 500 copies of the record, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of "Safety" entered the trade.
Now Coldplay is a world-renowned, respected and beloved band that has released seven albums with more than 100 million copies sold.
Over two decades, the band has won 107 various awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.

Dalia Grybauskaitė urges China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment in the European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign import conditions.
In opening the trade and investment forum at the Shanghai China import exhibition, Dalia Grybauskaitė underlined that in view of the signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "unite efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world", targeting the root causes of tensions caused by trade wars, "production surpluses and unfair competition".
"For the European Union, China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment is very important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," said Grybauskaite.
According to her, the opening of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The President underlined that investment transparency should be "above the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be essential to the environment of new investment relations," Grybauskaite stressed.
"Corrupted capital flows should not be welcome in any state in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to defuse criticism of avoiding opening up its market and protecting only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by several heads of state, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the data of the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently ranks 25th among its export partners.
Last year, Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50%, which amounted to 180 million euros.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some of the officials are concerned that Chinese investments in Lithuania can bring undesirable political influence, and Beijing's exclusive attention to Eastern Europe is divisive of the unity of the EU.

The cause of the Lion Air plane crash has been revealed: relatives of the dead are angry
Data from the black box of the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air's liner show that during at least four of its last flights, a malfunction in the speed gauge's work occurred, investigators reported Monday.
Soerianto Tjahjon, chairman of the National Transportation Security Committee (NTSK), said a similar outlier occurred during the aircraft's last four flights, including the fatal one when the liner fell in the Java Sea on October 29 shortly after takeoff from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board died in this crash.
Numerous media outlets reported disruptions during the previous flight of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, actually the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," Mr Tjahjon said at a press conference.
"Black box data showed that during the two flights before the flight Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
"There are a lot of rumors on social networks.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (remaining data) there were four flights during which there were problems with the airspeed gauge," the head of the NTSK said.
During a meeting with members of the families who died, Mr Tjahjono said that the information on the device recording the flight data is consistent with reports that the speed and altitude of the last flight had changed erratically since the aircraft took off.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air indicated that during a flight from Bali to Jakarta it had been repaired following the manufacturer's recommendations when a technical malfunction was detected.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to the Minister of Transport and Communications Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated the meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the remains of the plane and victims and the investigation of the crash.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Mr Kirana, together with his brother Kusnan, set up Lion Air in 1999.
Lion Air behaved improperly," said one man who introduced himself as the father of a passenger, Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on an island the plane was flying to.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- Lion Air has never contacted me since the start of the crisis.
We lost our child, but Lion Air did not show us any compassion."
After this meeting, Mr Kirana hastily left, avoiding journalists' questions.
Many families are waiting for the results of the long process of identifying the dead.
Nearly 140 corpses loaded parts of human remains have been handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives questioned why the liner, which had been in use two months earlier, was allowed to fly, although a fault occurred during the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, among other things, causing passengers to be startled by the sudden downfall of the plane immediately after takeoff.
Lion Air said this malfunction was removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the technicians concerned must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, not they said that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must answer according to the law so that plane crashes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Mr Tjahjono said that the large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris spread out in a relatively small area indicate that the liner was likely scouring into the water by flying at very high speed.
"The plane was seamless when it fell to sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the aircraft's engines, when it touched the water, operated in large turns - as shown by all the broken turbine blades," the official explained.
The Lion Air liner crash is the worst aviation crash in Indonesia since 1997, when the Garuda aircraft crashed near Medan killing 234 people.
After the accident, rescue workers rescued from the wreckage, including a minor.
On Monday night, cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz" collided at Tilviks on the road Vėžai - Plunge.
Cars collided with kactobush, and three people affected are reported.
The BMW driver, born in 1999, reportedly drove off to the opposite side of the traffic and the kaktomauska rallied to a car called Mercedes-Benz, which hosted Dad, born in 1967, and a daughter, born in 2005.
The "BMW" driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters - rescue workers.
The girl from Mercedes-Benz was knocked out of her teeth in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidential Palace: no artificial facilitations needed for referendum
Upon the approval by the Seimas of the proposal of the ruling parties to reduce the referendum bar for the first section of the Constitution, the President will veto the amendments, says Mindaugas Lingė, its adviser.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular of the articles contained in its first section, should certainly be at least as broad a majority.
It is easy to predict that the president would really veto," Dalia Grybauskaite's adviser to domestic politics told News Radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the foundational subjects of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the state, and therefore a reduction in the number of votes necessary to replace these articles would, according to Mrs Linge, create a "negative precedent" and "open up to uncontrollable risk".
"In the President's view, there is no need for artificial facilitations, more need to prepare for the referendum itself, more need for dialogue with the people," he said.
The Sejm on Tuesday plans to vote on the adoption of the Referendum Law Amendment.
It provides for a decision on amendments to section 1 and section 14 of the Constitution with higher protection to be taken if at least two-fifths of the citizens entitled to vote have consented to this during the referendum.
Currently, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote can replace the articles of Section One and Section Four of the Constitution by a referendum.
Some 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters and two fifths would be a million voters.
This motion was born after the Seimas approved in September a veto by the President on the amendments previously passed in parliament that watered down the requirements for the number of votes by changing Article 12 of Section One of the Constitution defining citizenship.
The cartel is proposed to be cut in the run-up to the referendum on dual citizenship, and should take place on May 12 and May 26 of next year, when the first and second rounds of presidential elections are planned.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990 are currently unable, with some exceptions, to hold dual citizenship.
The Lithuanian community of the world seeks double citizenship, but fears that in the current conditions a referendum would not take place - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian Airports "braška", so they need to be updated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is beginning to scratch, so it must be upgraded, Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis says.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is a minimum task that the State must perform.
"Air transport infrastructure is already a strawberry as it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must upgrade Vilnius Airport - this is not even part of long-distance planning, it is the minimum we must do," Mr. Masiulis said at a communication conference organised by the Democracy Development Fund and the State magazine on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be extremely important, because important projects will have to be implemented - construction of "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", construction of Klaipėda's outer port, renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, construction of an external port in Klaipėda, repair of airports, possibly decide on the construction of a new airport.
We have to stay awake, start projects that will realise our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years," said the Minister of Transport and Communications.
Mr. Masiulis has said that there has been too little money spent on road maintenance in recent years.
"The condition of roads is not improving so far, because the funds are not being allocated enough.
We are in the process of building new roads, but even for basic maintenance, for example, on express roads, there is a lack of funds.
We must set the amount to be allocated to road maintenance if we want their condition to improve," Mr. Masiulis said.
He stressed that Lithuanian transport sector services exports grew 18.6% this year, and the largest export market became Germany, ahead of Russia.
Mr Masiulis again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU hauliers be obliged to return the tugboats periodically to the country of registration.
"We must strive to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for tugs to return home on a permanent basis is absurd, because in Europe empty trucks would be driven, fuel burning, and emissions would be increased.
The railroads will be the most happy of all because the cost will increase to such an extent that part of the transport will pass on to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," stated Mr. Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, 12.2% is generated in the transport sector.
Gross domestic product (GDP) of Lithuania.
It employs more than 118,000 employees and has more than 7,500 businesses.
A dispute with heritage conservationists
Last week, Mr. Masiulis informed the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building, which would allow the demolition of the old terminal and construction of a new one.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis called the deliberations of Mr. Masiulis a political pressure.
According to him, a building built in the 1950 ’ s was a treasure recorded in the Register in 1993, and not for politicians, but for specialists to decide on its deletion.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"To pull that old terminal out of heritage would be a politically important step to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal, so that when it comes to Vilnius it would feel like a modern country rather than such an interesting, really unrepresenting our country as innovative," Mr. Masiulis said in the Seimas last week.
Mr. Masiulis then also announced that a completely new passenger terminal was planned to be built in Kaunas and the airport was to be connected to the Rail Baltica gauge by building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to be operational in 2026 after the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, 4.8 million passengers are expected this year, and 5 million passengers are expected next year.
Last year Kaunas Airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers.

Start direct flights to Madagascar from Vilnius next year
In the spring of next year, the largest regular passenger plane Boeing 767 will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly from Lithuania directly to the island of Bé, which belongs to Madagascar, according to the information of the tour operator Itaka Lietuva, writes the portal "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that passengers of Blue Panorama airlines will be able to choose from 259 economic and 8 business locations.
The new holiday destination will be reached directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominic Milowski, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says that he tries to offer tourists from Lithuania new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators have also prepared new holiday trips for the summer season 2019.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on possible crisis: important not to talk about illness
"We always have to get ready for harder times.
For the third year in a row, for the first time in the history of Lithuania, we accumulate reserves.
But it is also very important not to talk about illness," Mr Šapoka said during his visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday Minister of Finance and Vice-Minister Miglė Tuskienė attends meetings of the Eurogroup and the ECOFIN Council in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is intended to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that agreement be reached on how revenues from the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States are to be taxed until there is a global consensus.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected Italy’s draft budget as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has taken this opportunity.
Further information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of Economic and Monetary Union: options for the implementation of the European Deposit Insurance System and reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role for the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the ESM's functions need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.
Ballys Burach.
Lithuanian working traditions and customs
He recently reached the age of 120 from the birth of famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and ethnographer Bali Burač (1897-1972) in Sidari, Šiauliai Municipality, then Šiauliai Governorate.
In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian State, we have a great opportunity to remember how life-filled national revival has called many Lithuanian people, including brothers Burachs - Bali, Jonas, and Bronys - from the very depth of the village to all creative powers to engage in the nurturing, meaning and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas, who has traveled the land of his home country with a camera in his hands for over 50 years, presented a wide and realistic picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing deposits of national culture and had a rare ability to grasp the enduring value of his work.
In Balys Buračas photographs, Lithuanian landscapes, mounds, everyday life and celebrations were commemorated by our people in national costumes and decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This publication presents a significant part of Bali Burač's legacy, dedicated to the description of national labour customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and heavy occupation.
The book's manuscript is particularly rich in interwar Samogitian works, especially those of Kupiškėns, Šiauliai, Telshiškės, as well as those of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija residents, their festivals and other traditions and customs written by Bali Buračas.
Of the approximately 10,000 negatives preserved in museums and archives for this publication, over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photos have been selected, which are grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect unique aspects of ethnic culture typical of kupiškėns, Dzūks, and other Aukštaitija and Samogitia districts.

Tragic Destiny of a Couple: Killed after just a few hours of marriage
In the southwest of the U.S. state of Texas, a couple of newlyweds were killed in a helicopter crash just hours earlier.
24-year-old William Troy Byler and his peer wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler were killed on Sunday shortly after midnight by a helicopter cut into a hill 16 km northwest of Yuvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
Strangely enough, the disaster occurred with a flight of about 25 miles (24 km), just as the newlyweds were aged.
Helicopter pilot 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence was also killed.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University, located in the city of Texas State Huntsville.
They married on Saturday evening at the Byler family ranch near Yuvaldi and flew a family-owned helicopter after the wedding celebration.
The disaster occurred as the helicopter flew approximately 24 kilometres.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antonio International Airport, where they intended to board a plane and fly a honeymoon, said Mr Kennedy, without specifying the couple's final destination.
"It is a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and that hill is approximately 120-150 meters high," said Mr Kennedy.
G.D. Lawrence has been piloting that family's aircraft for many years.
According to Mr Kennedy, he was piloting helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
After autopsy, it should become clear what the pilot's physical condition was and whether she could not have been the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed approximately 5–10 minutes after takeoff.
His wreckage spewed a wide radius on the rocky hillside, and the hull remained "dangerously hung", said Flight Safety Investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Security Board (NTSB) on Monday during a press conference.
Investigators are going to take the wreckage out and then thoroughly inspect it, but it won't be easy for the tow truck and truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been identified and a preliminary NTSB report should be published in two weeks' time.
The Israeli Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions against Iran a "historic day"
"Today is a historic day," Mr Netanyahu told his party Likud MPs, his office reported.
"Today is the day that under President (Donald) Trump, the U.S. imposes particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the harshest sanctions on Iran throughout the time efforts have begun to curb his aggression," said the head of the Israeli government.
Earlier on Monday, Israel's Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman stated that the new sanctions would be a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the toughest sanctions of all time", came after Mr Trump's decision to withdraw from the world powers agreement with Tehran on his nuclear program in May and controversially.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iranian oil exports, which have already fallen by about a million barrels per day since May, and cut Tehran off from international funding.
Israel has long opposed the aforementioned agreement with Iran and says that its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish state also says that the lifting of sanctions has enabled Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria, and has promised to prevent it from establishing itself there militarily.
Other participants in the agreement with Iran - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - are opposed to the US decision and say that the agreement has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court reopens the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
At the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, the town of North, the court will hear the testimony of the witness in the accident case.
The Vilnius Regional Court decided on Tuesday that in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses of the case would be heard at the next hearing on November 26.
Acquittal has already been issued in this case, but the prosecutor's office disagrees with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car as a result of a motorcyclist's accident that ended in death, announcing that the 79-year-old Eduard Osipov was driving at a high speed in the city and committing a serious violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office asks the district court to annul the district court's verdict and states that E. Osipov is the biggest fault due to the accident, and the findings of the district court are unfounded.
An acquittal sentence is also requested by the family attorney of the dead motorcyclist.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015, at around 3 p.m., when the Škoda Fabia car, driven by E. Osipov, entered Žirmūnai Street and collided with a motorcycle that was on the main road.
The prosecutor's office blamed the man for the car driver's violation of the Road Traffic Rules, which provides for giving way, and caused a road accident - killing a man on the main road on the motorcycle "Piaggo".
Initial police reports indicated that the scooter driver was killed, but later after investigations, the vehicle was found to be equated in power with a motorcycle.
Vilnius City District Court judge Rolandas Bužinskas told BNS that the experts found that the motorcycle driver was driving at 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the speed allowed was 50 kilometres per hour.
"The driver of the car could not predict that the motorcycle would drive at such a high speed," the judge said.
At the time, the driver of the old car claimed to have driven at a speed of just 5 to 6 kilometers per hour.
A motorcycle driver who saw the obstacle tried to brake and fell off the vehicle before colliding with "Skoda Fabia".
The prosecutor's office believes that Mr Osipov, who drove from side to main road, should have given way to a motorcyclist.
Novaja Gazeta: Six Vagner mercenaries killed in Syria
Among the dead are five Syrian military soldiers and six persons belonging to the military company Wagner.
The "Novaja Gazeta" source in Syria announces this.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Military Corps was deployed in the said area, to which a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries" also joined.
"Novaja Gazeta" sent an inquiry to the Russian Foreign Ministry with a request to provide information on Russian fate.
Former Belgian king to undergo paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as a child of a former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a long-standing love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old ex-King denies parenthood.
According to the station's RTBF, he may appeal to the Supreme Court in opposition to DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boelis - the ex-husband of Delphine's mother - is neither biologically nor legally the father of an artist.
Delphine applied for the appropriate investigation so that the daughter of "real" father Albert could be recognized.
The CEC will distribute money to the parties, but will give nothing to the social workers
This week the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) intends to distribute a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), led by Vice-President of Parliament Gediminas Kirkilas, was established in spring this year and no budget funds have yet been planned.
But they can be awarded as soon as possible by a separate decision of the CEC in the event of a change in the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to lots.
Laura Matjošaityte, Chairwoman of the CEC, informed the VK that "this Thursday a commission meeting is scheduled to take a decision on the allocation of the budget half-yearly grant to the parties".
According to her, the CEC has until 15 November to take a decision on the matter.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are expected to be allocated EUR 2.751 million.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling Peasants' and Greens' Union – about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party – about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Liberal Movement – almost EUR 0.4 million, the Labour Party, which does not have its own group in the Seimas – about EUR 0.23 million, the recently joined the ruling Party of Order and Justice – almost EUR 0.22 million, represented in the parliament, but not for the Polish electoral campaign, which did not declare itself to be either ruling or opposition – about EUR 0.18 million.
Under the current law, which will guide the CEC in allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP established this spring to expect to receive money from the budget.
For this party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that the social workers will receive at least two hundred thousand euros in the run-up to the three elections next year - the self-government, the President and the European Parliament.
The respective amendments adopted by the Seimas to the laws of political parties and this year's budget were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the ruling parties, Mr. Kirkilas and Ramūnas Karbauskas, the leader of the peasant-greens, believe that the parliamentarians will seek to reject the President's objections.
However, this will not be possible until this Thursday's meeting of the CEC, so, according to Mrs Matjošaitytė, "grants will be divided according to the legal order that still exists".
It is true that the Head of the Supreme Court did not rule out that if the Seimas rejected the President's veto this week or next week and the new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to the parties took effect, the Commission may consider a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"In making our decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force because we are an executive body to implement the laws being passed," she said.
Should the Seimas be able to reject the veto and the new laws come into force, additional money would be allocated to the parties by the Government upon additional borrowing.
Grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Poroshenko: Victims of murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
"I want to state that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be checked very carefully in accordance with the investigation procedures.
I as president do not have the opportunity and do not have to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish evil," Mr Poroshenko spoke at a meeting with young people on Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he was most interested in having Mr Handziuk's murder clarified and that the murderers, crime organizers and customers would "accept the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been retrained into murder (a case), they are absolutely right and justified in the threat of life imprisonment," the President of Ukraine said.
He rightly called the public's demand to investigate the case openly and impartially.
Poroshenko stressed that the speeches of representatives of the law enforcement authorities in parliament should show that "the government is determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whatever they may be".
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not help to clarify the situation, but would further confuse everything.
"I urge all, both the power and the forces supporting the opposition, not to waste on unjustified arguments and, defend God, not to use this assassination for public relations," the president said.
- On the contrary, we must now unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - such as to build public confidence.
There's just no other way for us."
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the situation in the country," he assured.
Mr Handziuk, who had fought against corruption, was attacked and covered with acid in the city of Kherson in July.
She was an advisor to the mayor of this southern city of Ukraine.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but died in hospital on Sunday.
After police and prosecutors failed to clear the perpetrators of the attack, Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenka handed in a resignation statement on Tuesday.
After her death, government officials received accusations from public activists that they were unable to carry out the investigation properly.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister of the Interior.
"I am making my resignation statement today," reported Mr Lucenka to MPs, reading his investigation report.
Parliament has yet to approve the prosecutor's resignation.
Mr Lucenka accused the activists of exerting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Handziuk.
Bill Gates presented the water-free toilet
In introducing the futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such facilities to waterless ones to the computer revolution of the 1970 ’ s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates introduced a high-tech toilet at an exhibition in Beijing that does not need water supply in pipes, Reuters reported.
The water-free toilet works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of sewage are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technology you see here is the greatest achievement in sanitation in the last 200 years," Bill Gates was quoted by Bloomberg.
The technological toilet was created at the expense of a charity foundation set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Within seven years, work was done on an installation that could convert human waste into fertilizers or water, with the fund spending $200 million to do so.
In total, about 20 toilet models were created, in the words of Bill Gates.
The facility is now complete and can be sold.
However, so that such toilets can be produced en masse, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500 thousand children under the age of five die each year as a result of poor sanitation in the world.
Tackling the problems of poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, is increasing health spending, which has already reached 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates to a toilet presentation of a jar with feces.
According to him, this is a good reminder of the fact that a small example "may contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100,000 worm parasite eggs".

Anxiety in France: human deaths cause concern
French health officials announced on Monday that they had permanently banned the widespread use of pesticides, following concerns over several dozen recently poisoned people in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all products containing pesticide metam was taken following a new safety inspection launched earlier this year, even before at least three poisoning waves began in September in the Department of Arts and Loire.
As a result of these cases, the government had already stopped the use of the pesticide.
This soil disinfection chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, its annual use was approximately 700 tons.
At least 70 people, including a large number of farm workers, in the Ange region, where many lettuces are grown, complained of a sore eye and throat, and of breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but did not rush it," said ANSES deputy director Francoise Weber (Fransuaza Weber) to the Ouest France newspaper on Monday.
Metam - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe - is considered a 'probable human carcinogen' by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).
This pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is permitted in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is to be carried out.
"There was no choice but to remove it from the market, whether or not there are alternatives to it," Mr Weber told the aforementioned newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties that will arise for producers of lettuce, for farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to stop the use of the cast in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
This region near Nantes produces more than half of the 35,000 tons of lettuce consumed annually in Europe.
The next season will be "much fewer salad broths, radishes and couples", last month, after the government stopped using the cast, Philippe Retiere, head of the Federation of Nantes Growers, told AFP news agency.
70 million EUR invested in the shopping centre with a roundabout in Tallinn
The new T1 shopping centre opened in the Estonian capital next weekend, in which Pro Kapital Grupp, a local capital real estate development company (NT), invested EUR 70 million.
130.000 sq. m of total, or 55,000 sq. m rented, area in the shopping centre will be open for 150 store services or entertainment places, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer's report.
By comparison, the total area of Vilnius Akropolis (calculated together with the area for offices) amounts to about 110.000 sq. m. And it is rented - 91.000 sq. m.
"T1" - the first shopping centre with a view wheel installed on the roof, states the developer.
It will be operational early next year.
In addition to this, international transport gateways will also be integrated into the area, with trams adjacent to it, and intercity buses will soon be operating.
The main "Rail Baltica" terminal is also nearby, and is expected to serve 1 million passengers per year around 2026.
Paolas Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that the global supermarket business is undergoing major changes, and that the development of T1 has succeeded in putting it at the forefront.
"We have created a new generation shopping centre that provides emotions and experience that are not accessible online.
It is a place of attraction for people in the very centre of the city, a traveler's gateway, an impressive and noteworthy destination and at the same time a qualitative time spent with friends or family," Mr. Michelozzi is quoted in the press release.
A High Focus on Entertainment
According to the manager of the shopping centre, "T1" also has the largest entertainment and discovery center in the Baltic States.
A total of 12,000 sq. m., or one fifth of the total rental area, is allocated for entertainment in the facility.
Exclusive accent - a view wheel on the roof.
It will raise guests to the height of 120 m above sea level - the taller TV tower in Tallinn.
Under the review circle, on the fourth floor, there will be a trampoline park "Super Skypark", which will open the largest trampoline centre in Europe and the first basketball and volleyball court in Estonia, says the company.
The interactive SkyLAB Research and Discovery Centre promises children to take at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will also house 360 degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the regular cinema shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to empathize with virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to visual effects and the rhythm of the film, the sense of reality will be enhanced here by the felt effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as selected smells, smoke or fog in the movie hall.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonian tourism revenues by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Stock Exchange as well as the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the Group received EUR 1.8 million in sales revenue and incurred EUR 350.000 in losses, according to Pro Kapital Grupp's financial report.
In 2016 the Lithuanian market generated sales revenue of almost EUR 9 million and net profit of EUR 2.4 million was earned.
The T1 shopping centre was built by Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
President Paul Biya sworn in in Cameroon for his seventh term after a controversial election
During a ceremony supervised by the Speaker of Parliament, Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, Mr. Biya, aged 85, promised to protect the "unity and unity" of the West African state.
Africa's oldest president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner in the October 7 election, with 71% of the vote.
However, the election was eclipsed by low voter turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of the inauguration of Mr. Biyos, 79 students and three school staff, including principals, were kidnapped at a Presbyterian school in the Northwest Region, where English-speaking separatists are conducting an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of the 22 million people in Cameroon are French-speaking, and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, the North West and neighboring South West Province began to demand autonomy as a result of dissatisfaction with alleged discrimination in the fields of education, judiciary and economics.
In 2017, following Mr. Biya's refusal to indulge, the Radicals declared an independent state, the "Republic of Ambasonia", and raised arms.
According to non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces officers were killed this year in separatist attacks and government response operations.
More than 300,000 people have fled violence: some across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in the undernourished forests.
In the October elections, only 5% of voters voted in the Northwest region and 15% of the electorate in the South West province.
In both parts of the country, Mr. Biya received two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative primary elections: mistakes due to inexperience
"Some things were missing in places - realize that the party organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities allowed their own premises to be used, but voting booths were not everywhere, because we cannot afford them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent it," the politician said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not change, and the infringements themselves are not malignant in nature.
"There were complaints.
Not all the people who participated in the elections were experienced - they too had the news.
Thus, not all our actions were in line with our orders.
So it was necessary to warn the CRC to comply with the principles we described.
Those complaints do not, however, give cause to doubt the results," said Mr Anušauskas.
According to the president of the CCC, there have been cases where ballot papers were unsealed - when the ballot papers found in ballot boxes were found to have been annulled without a stamp.
Some towns lacked space, but according to Anušauskas, complaints and irregularities relate to several dozen ballot papers.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it certainly does not make a substantial difference to the results of the elections," A. Anušauskas explained.
The party's turnout in the election is said to have been 55%, while the turnout for non-partisan voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked on commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also remain unchanged - 79% of voters (16418 votes) voted for the winning Ingrid Shimonyte, while 21 percent (4441 votes) voted for Vygaudas Ušackas.
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support Šimonytė's candidacy in the country's presidential election in May next year.
Trump says he probably won't meet Putin in Paris
White House National Security Advisor John Bolton said earlier that Mr Trump would meet with Mr Putin in Paris, where the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I will be celebrated this week.
However, while leaving for the last rallies before the U.S. Congressional midterm election, Mr Trump stated to reporters that he was not sure if this would be the right opportunity to meet with the Russian President.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," noted the President of the United States.
Still, added the White House leader, they will see each other at the G-20 summit and "probably will meet many times" afterwards.
D. Trump is still trying to "reboot" relations with Moscow, despite allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Kęstutis Strupas requests annulment of VTEK decision
Kęstutis Strupas, the former Director General of Santara Clinics of Vilnius University, requests that the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEK) be overturned - it acknowledged that transactions were not declared in due time and thus violated the law.
Mr Strupas' complaint was examined by Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant requests the annulment of the decision of 23 May of the VTEK, the BNS was informed by the representative of the court Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė.
Mr Strupas believes that gifts given to relatives should not be declared, he claims that he understood the exception from the law.
In May, VTEK announced that K. Strupas, the Director General of Santara Clinics and Silvija Strupienė, the Head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, were then suspended in violation of the provisions of the Law regulating the declaration of private interests.
The investigation found that four transactions were declared not in compliance with the scheduled deadlines: in 2010 a loan was taken from the bank with the spouse, the acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift was given to the daughter in 2017 - an apartment and in 1996 a loan was granted to a natural person together with the spouse and not recovered.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by missing time limits.
Persons who have violated the Law on the Adjustment of Public and Private Interests in the Civil Service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own data but also your spouse’s data.
The investigation was conducted by VTEK on the basis of Info TV television information.
It was explained whether K. Strupas and his spouse, the head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, S. Strupienė had properly and timely declared the transactions they had concluded.
Last year, as announced by Info TV, K. Strupas gave his daughter a real estate worth 125 thousand euros.
However, the former head of Santara clinics and his wife had not stated the above data in their declarations of interest.
Law enforcement together with at least ten other individuals have made allegations in the corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, for winning public computer and software purchases in clinics, illegal financial remuneration was demanded from companies, it is disguised as support.
In this way K. Strupas is suspected of having consulted at least five times during public procurement in the field of information technology in Santara clinics.
Mr Strupp himself denies his guilt.
In September, Professor K. Strupas, suspected of corruption, was dismissed from his position as head of Santara clinics.
According to the decision of the Santara clinic partners Ministry of Health and Vilnius University, employment relations with K. Strupas were terminated at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10, 2013.
Santara clinics are still temporarily headed by Professor Juozas Raistenskis, until the competition to elect a new CEO is held, and it is promised to be announced this year.

You already want to teach differently in schools: promises fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday at the forum "Changes in the content of education: foreign experience for decisions in Lithuania".
The Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė, who spoke during the discussion, said that over 30 million euros have been invested in updating the content of education over the last ten years, but no results can be seen.
"According to the results of the International Survey of Pupil Achievements PISA, pupils' achievements are below the average of OECD countries," Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said.
The OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted in the report of the Ministry of Education and Science, said that Lithuania was too focused on providing knowledge rather than on practical application of knowledge.
According to him, education programmes in Lithuania focus on students' literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also needed to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
Gražvydas Kazakevičius, Deputy Minister of Education and Science, presented changes in the general content of education, said that the scope of programmes started this school year will decrease, they will be more specific and disciplines will be more closely linked to each other.
According to the Vice Minister, student education will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30% of the content of their unique education, the current student assessment system will change to a cumulative score, greater weight will be gained and informally acquired student competence.
There will be fewer standardised tests.
Promises that general curricula will be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, task bank.
The aim of updating the content of education is to improve students' achievements in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to reduce by a third the gap between pupils' achievements, students' acquired modern competences at school, and to be literate in various fields.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million of EU and state budget funds to update education content from May 2018.
It is expected that the project of the updated general education programs for the 2019-2020 school year will be tested in part of the schools, and starting in September 2021 they will be implemented in all schools.
The Ministry received criticism in early October regarding the nearly €8 million project carried out by the Development Centre for Education to update the general programmes of primary, basic and secondary education.
For four years, €7.8 million was earmarked for this, and the first purchase of €1.3 million was announced at the beginning of October, seeking out education providers.
After the experts criticized this purchase, he was suspended, and Minister of Education and Science J. Petrauskienė dismissed Giedrius Vaidelis from her position.
Exercises to respond to extreme flooding in Lithuania
In Lithuania, a ten-day exercise to improve the response of institutions to extreme flooding begins on Monday.
As the Fire and Rescue Department ( Fire and Rescue Department) informed, the exercise will check how state institutions are prepared to work in the country in the event of a state-level emergency, such as flooding: to eliminate its consequences, coordinate people search, rescue and emergency eviction from flooded areas, organise their supply of drinking water, food, ensure the necessary energy supply and take care of other measures to protect the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries, other institutions, as well as 12 municipal emergency operations centres will participate in the exercise.
The preparatory phase of the exercise will take place on 5-13 November, during which the municipalities will take decisions on emergency management after receiving information from the Hydrometeorological Service from the PRTD about the continuing rainfall and the beginning of the flood.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for November 14–15.

The exercise will also demonstrate the combined capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to pump large amounts of water from flooded areas.
For this purpose, the BaltFloodCombat module was established in 2009.
Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuri Lucenka resigns
Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenka, speaking in the country's parliament on Tuesday, announced his resignation due to resonance caused by the death of an acid-flooded fighter against corruption Katherine Gandziuk, announced by the Ukrainian news agency Union.net.
Under Ukrainian law, the resignation request must be submitted by the Attorney General to the President of the country, who must submit to the Verkhovna Rada for approval by a majority.
On Tuesday, Attorney General Lucenko presented the progress and results of a law enforcement investigation into the ordering of K. Gandziuk's murder in Verkhovna Rada.
In a speech to parliamentarians, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that the death of Mr Gandziuk was being exploited for public relations by politicians.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist and anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her home town of southern Ukraine, Kherson.
On 31 July, K. Gandziuk, an unknown assailant in the face of her home, was pricked with acid.
She died in hospital on 4 November due to her injuries.
Protesters under the Ukrainian Ministry of the Interior demand an answer on who killed K. Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix photo.
According to Mr Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation figures 12 persons possibly related to the order of K. Gandziuk's assassination.
However, one of the most likely versions of the investigation was leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the Attorney General, due to a leak of information, the suspects received essential knowledge for them.
Mr Lucenko added that he knew personally Mr Gandziuk and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"In order for no one to have reason to say that someone clings to power, I wish to state that I am making a statement to resign.
I will present it today to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss this issue in Parliament," Mr Lucenko quotes the publication 'Obozrevatel' in Rada.
Mr Lucenko is said to have added that he "can't allow bi-governance in the country when the law enforcement system is foiled without any evidence, even for the crimes revealed."
Mr Lucenko is considered a close associate of the country's president, Peter Poroshenko.
He was appointed Attorney General on 12 May 2016 after prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shockin, suspected of covering up corruption by top-level officials and politicians from this post.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Elta was informed by Aurelija Vernickaitė, adviser to the Minister of Energy, the meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector currently below the aggregated trajectory of the national renewable energy action plans at EU level, with 6% of renewable energy in 2015.
The EC estimates that progress towards the binding 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to various difficulties, including relatively high greenhouse gas reduction costs and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy comes mainly from biofuels (88%) and electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas has taken up the suggestion to supplement the issues of corruption investigation with the appeals of the Conservatives to the CT
On Tuesday after the submission, the Seimas approved such a proposal, which was registered for the investigation into the illegal influence of the "Valstietė" Agnė Širinskienė, the leader of the political processes.
For there were 58 Members of the Seimas, against - 27, nine MPs abstained.
Next, the draft will be discussed by the Seimas committees, the main appointed Committee on Legal Affairs headed by A. Širinskienė.
Upon receipt of his opinion, a vote will be taken on the adoption of an amendment to the resolution.
Currently, the Provisional Investigation Commission of the Seimas conducting a new investigation of political corruption has been instructed to investigate possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed to extend this time limit by stating that "significant information about possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions appeared in the public domain".
Širinskienė identifies in the project "a possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or when addressing the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Chief Official Ethics Commission".
An appeal to the Constitutional Court for pensions was initiated by opposition conservatives.
The ruling " peasants" found that the Conservatives relied to a large extent on the arguments of private pension fund advocates in their appeal.
The influence on the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEK) "Statemen" leaders accuse former fellow member Povilas Urbšis.
According to them, the former chairman of the Seimas Committee on State Management and Municipalities could instruct members of the LTEK to dismiss the former head of the Commission's Prevention Division Mindaugas Narrow.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to investigate the influence of interested persons or their groups, their influence on the conduct of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, the activities and financing of parties and public movements, legislative processes, the election and appointment of heads of state-owned enterprises, public establishments, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to look at the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to competent authorities and how they have responded to it.
Investigators are expected to submit their findings by May 1 of next year.
At that time there will be a presidential, European Parliament election campaign.
Of the 12 members of the commission, seven are representatives of "the peasants".
Two social workers, one "ruler", a Liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian Polish Electoral Action-Christian Families Union were also appointed as members.
Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the commission's work.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskas, Chairman of the Union of Managing Peasants and Greens of Lithuania.
According to him, the investigation by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSDC) conducted last session largely on the same subjects showed that the investigation needed to be continued.
Germany's head of internal intelligence has lost his post
The 55-year-old H. G. Maassen further incited the controversy by stating that "radical left forces" in the Merkel coalition were to blame for his troubles.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but forced to retire to the reserve.
Among other things, it became clear last weekend that, at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Mr Maassen criticised Mrs Merkel's 'naive' immigration policy.
After long defending the head of intelligence, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer stated at a press conference on Monday that Mr Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and "disappointed personally".
Mr Seehofer, himself under pressure due to both this dispute and the poor performance of his party in the Bavarian local government election, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to put H. G. Maassen in reserve.

Splendid girls destroy stereotypes about wedding dresses
A lofty girl with a white puffy bride dress - mission (no) possible?
Can the white swan swimming towards the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
The participants of the Plus Size Reality Show Evolution of Size (r) will prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on the kilograms of woman.
But that's not all - one of the project's girls will be touching the tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will be on the shooting ground.
"There are still those who think that bigger girls don't get the boys' attention or glances.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me as I am, he doesn't require some standard-compliant figure from me," Aurika, a participant in the show, will talk to the wedding dress before the show.
Wedding dress is not easy, in all senses, clothing - it is a complex construction, it has a lot of material, dress heavy, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women believe that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident.
I can reassure you that a properly selected dress model really solves this "problem," explained one of the show's panel members, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The fates of the girls in the project R. Kalinkinas is decided together with the entire commission - plus size fashion house opening Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social networking star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Bird.
"When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there are a lot of quarrels between the members of the commission - after all, we all represent different spheres and differently imagine the winner of the show.
The task of showing wedding dresses was even more complicated, and this - now I can reveal - that two newcomers appeared, which were certainly not inferior to the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense," Mr Kalinkin says.
Newcomers - Eve famous for her 23-year-old scandalous behaviour in one summer reality show and the 31-year-old mother of outstanding beauty in two children Dovilė - like other girls participated in the selection of "The Evolution of Size (r)" and placed in the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo shoot of the girls in the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The show's girls were returned to the LNK by viewers who voted their favorites on the television portal.
Internationally acclaimed reality show of superb beauties takes place in Lithuania for the second week - here plus-sized girls compete for the name of the first star in the country plus-sized.
So far, there are only eight of them left - and they all understand perfectly well that the winner can only be one.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "The Evolution of Size (r)" starts as early as this Monday evening at 8:30 p.m. via LNK.
Actor I. Elba elected world's sexiest man
People magazine in the United States announced this year's sexiest man in the world.
He became the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that this message was unexpected, he did not lack wit when he related the new title.
I thought, "It can't be!
Seriously?".
Then I looked myself in the mirror and thought - yes, I look sexy today - the actor was laughing.
Speaking frankly, Idris identified this title as an extremely pleasant feeling that deepened his ego.
The British star claims to have often received abusive words and bullying, which made his childhood uneasy, since, as he himself identifies, he was "very tall and clumsy".
The young actor disliked his peers and became an object of bullying and because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"As soon as I grew up with a mustache and muscle I became the coolest guy in my city district," smiles Idris.
When a man does not have to be proud of himself on the screens in Os, Mr Elba works as a disco at parties held in Spain, and especially in the buzzy Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a vein for fashion, which he realizes by creating his own line of clothing.
The British actor assures him that family is the most important thing in the world, so he plans a wedding with fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the 33rd most sexiest man in the world elected by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was given to Blake Shelton.
Husband beaten to death during a drink in Sirvintai district
On Monday evening, a man was beaten to death during a drink in Šalkiškiai village in Širvintai district.
According to the Vilnius County Police, at 9:16 p.m., a report was received that a man had beaten a neighbor during a drink.
When the medical officers arrived, they found the death of a man born in 1943.
A 1994-born suspect was detained, with 2.53 prom drunkenness.

Management no longer requires a distance of 20 km for the construction of incinerators
Vilnius combined power plant, near the Gariūnai market, is under construction.
Those in charge are no longer seeking to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from the settlements in the construction of waste incinerators.
The head of the Committee on Environmental Protection Kęstutis Mažeika registered an amendment to the Waste Management Law at the Seimas on Monday, thereby refusing such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mažeika, the " peasant" faction, who had previously supported the provision for a distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment for its refusal.
Mr. Mažeika's amendment provides that, as of January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built under statutory environmental and public health protection requirements.
He admits that the amendments were prompted by the president's doubts about such a ban.
"Having regard to the definition of a residential area, it is obvious that such a place where the above objects could be built would be almost impossible to discover," the committee chairman states.
The ruling majority opposed the President's veto amendments in October, tightening up the construction of waste incinerators.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants closer than 20 km from the settlements, the amendments provided for permission for the Government to take decisions on the future of the two plants already under construction, taking into account public health interests.
The latter provision, Mr. Mažeika, does not propose an adjustment.
In Vilnius, the waste and biofuel-fired power plant is built by the energy group Lietuvos energija, and in Kaunas - together with the company Fortum Heat Lithuania of the Finnish energy concern Fortum.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipėda.
Talking about a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on Monday to deal with the difficult Northern Ireland issue stalling the Brexit talks, reported Dublin.
Speaking by phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered the opportunity to review the mechanism of the so-called insurance arrangement, which would allow the open border between the United Kingdom province of Northern Ireland and the European Union-owned Republic of Ireland to be left open.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from this agreement, according to a report issued by the Irish government.
In the conversation, Mr May 'has raised the possibility of reviewing the mechanism for hedges', it states.
"Varadkar has made it clear that it is open to the review of new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review is not linked to a unilateral decision to terminate the insurance measures," the government's report says.
Brexit negotiators find no acceptable solution to avoid inspections at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain withdraws from the Single Market and Customs Union next March.
Both parties agree on "prohibitive measures" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open pending the conclusion of a larger trade agreement to ensure that additional customs controls at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied temporarily to the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is seeking that Britain could withdraw from the insurance arrangements unilaterally after three months.
However, Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "can't support" this.
"Three months or a limited period of time the means of insurance are not worth the paper on which it will be written," he stated.
In the past, London and Brussels have failed to confirm the Brexit breakthrough in the negotiations following the announcement in Britain on the weekend that an agreement is at hand.
"I would say that we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done," stated a spokesman for Mr May in London.
Margaritis Schin, a spokesman for the European Commission, also told reporters: 'We are not there yet'.
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of outstanding thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the internet era.
Among the 25 individuals who have signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Senas (Amartja Senas) and Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, as well as Nobel Prize laureate writer Mario Vargas Llosa (Marius Vargas Liosa).
"We call on goodwill leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate through which citizens can make decisions based on facts," the group's report says.
They argue that the "global information and communication space" is a common good that "must be protected in order to enhance freedom of expression and views".
"People have a fundamental right to receive information that is freely collected, processed and distributed, based on the truth of commitment, the principles of pluralism of attitudes, and rational methods of establishing facts," added the authors of the declaration.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who often criticizes "false news", but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
The world leaders should take a stand on this issue when they come together for the Peace Forum in Paris on 11-13 November, called on the signatories.
This declaration was made within two months under the leadership of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Christopher Deluar), the head of Paris-based media freedom and journalist rights advocacy organization "Reporters Without Borders" (RSF).
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama (Frensis Fukuyama).
The Seimas approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Law on Product Safety providing that fines for product safety violations must be increased.
The amendments were adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As Mr Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Committee on Health Affairs of the Seimas, said, when it comes to the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives set relate to better protection of consumers of products.
In addition, its provisions shall be adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"In my opinion, the proposed draft law is better and more specifically distributed to all those involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, as entities who pay fines continue to commit repeated infringements," Mr Vinkus said.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, and after the approval of the Government the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments are aimed at increasing fines for infringements, strengthening the protection of consumer rights, empowering market surveillance authorities and creating a clear framework for the supervision of product safety requirements and compliance with them.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for producers to properly label the product in order to ensure its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the market surveillance authorities have not been granted access to the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of producers and suppliers when carrying out state product safety controls, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry’s assessment, the six-month time limit for imposing fines and warnings is too short to detect the infringement, to conduct an investigation and to impose a fine.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the penalties imposed are not sufficiently effective.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy proposed introducing an obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product in order to ensure its traceability in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right, when carrying out the state control of product safety, to enter the territory, buildings, premises of the economic entities which produce, place products on the market, carry out inspections.
The intention is to increase the amount of fines for violations of the law.
The producer, importer or authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and the distributor who has made dangerous products available on the market, provided dangerous services or provides services would be fined between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (now between 144 and 1 448).
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority decided to prohibit the placing on the market and placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of EUR 1 000 to 5 000 (now 868 to 4 344) would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the requirement to withdraw dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and dispose of them would result in a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (now between EUR 1 448 and EUR 5 792).
If dangerous products caused harm to the consumer's health, a fine of €2,500 to €15,000 (now 1.448 to 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the consumer's death, a fine of between €6,500 and €25,000 (now 5 792 and €23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to EUR 25,000 is imposed for a violation of product safety legislation (the minimum amount of the fine has not been established), in Belgium - from EUR 26 to EUR 600 thousand, in Romania - from EUR 155 to EUR 6.666, and in Bulgaria - from EUR 125 to EUR 7 500.

A 10-year-old girl raped by her older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby saw the world thanks to the caesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.

The Norwegian Armed Battalion participated in NATO exercises in the outermost and harshest areas
Troops from the Norwegian Armed Forces participated in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital Oslo.
It is part of the NATO exercise Trishank Joint 2018 - the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the troops from the second battalion of Norwegian troops spent a lot of time away from home after the September 11 terrorist attacks, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But most of all, they are skilled at war in the Arctic, and these skills are particularly useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, troops in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the outermost and harshest areas, have engaged in staged battles against true British soldiers.
Troops have the skills to survive in this cold wild, but in the harsh climate they have to drag much greater weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers staying at the headquarters say they share their skills to survive and fight under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, this exercise, which like no other is particularly reminiscent of real warfare, will teach them to be ready if there is a serious threat.

Povilas Mačiulis, the former vice-mayor of Kaunas, who left his job in the municipality and "United Kaunas" organization in the presidential election due to his support for Vygaudas Usackas, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
"I'm going to concentrate on business.
I am a shareholder in several companies, and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to devote more time to the family," Mr Mačiulis said to the BNS.
He said he also did not plan to participate in the forthcoming municipal elections.
Mr. Mačiulis has not yet had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Ušackas after he lost the primary elections of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ms. Ingrida Shimonyte on Sunday.
"To be honest, we have not yet been able to discuss the results with him and the team in detail and talk about the future plans.
It is clear that after Vygaudas left the further electoral struggle this stage of my life is over," said Mr Mačiulis.
He said that he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas policy for supporting V. Ušackas, but regretted that "Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations".

He is a shareholder of the private school "Erudito Lyceum" and several other companies.
The workers are working at Kaunas Castle: what are they doing here?
Having noticed the workers who were working at Kaunas Castle, the Kaunas residents hoped that the reconstruction of the surviving tower was finally under way.
For the portal kauno.diena.lt Director of Kaunas City Museum Gabrielius Sužindelis said that the works of the south-west tower with a fragment of the defensive wall protective roofing are taking place here.
According to the interviewer, the roofs will be cans.
"The worn-out tin coating in emergency condition threatened the surrounding - people could fall in and hurt themselves - so it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so this was also detrimental to heritage," the museum director explained.
Will these canopies be similar to those some centuries ago?
"All works are combined with heritage and other institutions," G. Sužindalis added, seeking to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time the practical side - roofs must protect the values from moisture.
A universal solution has been chosen when working with heritage.
Before that, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered with tin during the Soviet era, so they no longer had any historical value", - detailed the director of Kaunas City Museum.
The works contract was signed on October 2.
It is planned that the work will not last longer than three months after the signing of the contract.
"It is hoped that it will be completed by the end of November," the director of the museum taught his expectations.
According to him, the value of the works performed amounts to almost 24 thousand euros.
This amount, according to the speaker, was set out in this year's budget.
The works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company "Statija".
Kaunas. diena.lt has written how, according to the research carried out, Kaunas castle may have looked earlier.

The Eastern European Studies Centre will collaborate with two prominent brain centres in the United States
According to Linas Kojala, the head of EESC, based in Vilnius and counting for thirteen years, networking in the USA will allow to implement projects and make Lithuania's voice heard more on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that the two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will emerge because the topics of NATO, security, disinformation, development of Eastern Partnership countries are also priority topics for them," Kojala said.
The agreements note that EESC and US institutions will work together to prepare cross-border project applications, exchange expertise and expertise, and organise expert visits.
This should be especially useful for Lithuanian analysts, since both partners have a great international reputation.
The FPRI has been active since 1955 and brings together nearly one hundred top analysts.
In the latest worldwide ranking of analytical centers compiled by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI ranked seventh in its category.
At that time, CEPA, whose analysts have been repeatedly invited to consult and work in the highest political institutions in the United States, is ranked tens in the same category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to break into the U.S. information space and encourage us to raise the quality bar up," added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be the help of partners in distributing the upcoming EESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among decision-makers in the USA and in the public domain.
The Eastern Europe Studies Centre operates on the basis of ongoing projects and is not supported by targeted grants.
EESC partners with joint initiatives include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.

North Ogden's 39-year-old mayor Brent Taylor, north of Salt Lake City, had taken a year-long vacation to perform a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the Joint Forces Headquarters, but was to return to serve as mayor in January.
