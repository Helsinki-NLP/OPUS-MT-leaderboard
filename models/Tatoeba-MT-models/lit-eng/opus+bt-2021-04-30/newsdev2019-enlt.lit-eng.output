The Panic of a Thousand Crowd in Central Park after the Fall of the Barrier
Thousands of people who panicked for potential shots in the political nature of the event have let themselves run down Central Park following the collapse of the police barrier.
Prominent personalities – New York Governor Andrew Cuomo representing the Democratic Party, Republican Senator Jeff Flake, Janet Jackson, and John Legends – urged viewers to engage in turbulent politics in the country.
When the barrier fell at an event on Saturday evening, authorities quickly assured viewers that they were safe.
The event, which began on the sunny afternoon, focused on social justice.
Approximately 60,000 observers gathered at the Universal Citizens' Festival held on the Great meadow, where Cardi B, The Weeknd and other popstars were to appear.
Some speakers asked the audience to call the Congressmen representing them and to express their views on the Senate sittings this week on the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh.
Continuous series of Alastair Seeley's victories at the British Supersport race in Assen
Alastair Seeley retained the winning position in the British Supersports race
Alastair Seeley won his third win in five British Supersport races, defeating him in a 12-wheel sprint in Assen in the Netherlands on Saturday.
A racer from Karikfergus took 0.05 seconds ahead of Jack Kennedy, who drives the Yamaha.
The 38-year-old winner also triumphed at Silverstone and Oulton Park this month.
Seeley represents the Northern Ireland team EHA Racing, with which he has already won the North West 200 international race in May.
The former British champion competed with Kennedy throughout the race and, despite all the efforts of the dublinian, he failed to outrun a rival from Northern Ireland.
Seeley's teammate David Allingham remained seventh in the Supersport race on Saturday.
Scott Swann finished the British Talent Cup race eighth.
Glenn Irwin, who drives without Wiser Ducati and tries to rise above the current fourth place in the championship rankings, was fourth in the two qualifying runs of the Sunday British Superbike race.
This week it was reported that Irwin will move to JG Speedfit Kawasaki for the 2019 season.
Michael Laverty of Toome, driving Tyco BMW, was ranked 13th, while Andrew Irwin and his PBM Ducati were ranked 14th.
Why do Hong Kong domestic workers learn dance moves?
In Hong Kong, about 300,000 foreigners work as domestic workers.
They are required by law to live in employers' homes.
These employees work six days a week, up to 18 hours a day, for a small fee.
This story is about Mhelanie, who devotes the only day off to community events helping to break away from the insular work routine.
The doughnut seller Lina Ognissanti will be honored by the mayor of Bedford
In the photo: Lina Ognissanti sells ice cream during the warm season and donuts in winter.
For more than 40 years, a woman who has been trading in cones and ice cream in the city centre will be honoured with a private reception by the mayor.
Lina Ognissanti, who sells ice cream and donuts at the Dinky Donuts kiosk on Bedford Midland Road, along with her family, was invited to have a papal tea.
Nearly 3,000 people have signed a petition online to be awarded or recognised.
Mr. Ognissanti said that it was an honour for her to receive such praise.
According to Bedford Mayor Dave Hodgson, Mr. Ognissanti and his children and grandchildren were invited to his office to inspect the city's regalia and historical artifacts and to drink pope tea.
"Lina Bedforfe occupies a special place, and her kiosk is part of the city centre," he said.
I'm glad she accepted my invitation, and I look forward very much to our meeting in my office so that I can thank Lina for her work in our city."
Mr. Ognissanti thanked, in her words, the "pleasant" residents of Bedford who thought about her and said, "It is a great honour and a beautiful act."
Sarkab Mahmood, who submitted the petition, said that he did not expect to receive so many signatures.
Upon hearing of the reception, which is scheduled to be held by the end of the year, he said: "I am very happy about Lina because she deserves it because of her excellent character."
On the road with Alster Lambretta Club
The scooters Lambretta were indispensable mod culture satellites of the 1960s.
A group of Italian scooter fans are trying to preserve the spirit of those times.
70 years after the founding of the first Alster Lambretta Club, this weekend around 100 amateur scooters from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered in Fermana County.
One of the first two club members, Chris Wilson, purchased the first Lambretta in 1966 for about £40.
“For me, the scooter was just a vehicle, but I learned that I could use it in a different way.
It was a bit of a sport.
I didn't get involved in mod culture, and now I'm probably too old for that," he said.
“It was quite cheap and quite reliable, you could buy it at an affordable price, and when you bought it, you could do more than just drive from point A to point B.”
He participated in Lambretta's separate start race in the Isle of Man TT ring.
The first Alster Lambretta Club was founded in the early 1970s and transformed 12 years ago.
"About 1971, scooters and other forms of transport became less and less interested in people, as well as the clubs in general suffered as a result of the unrest, so I thought, "Everything, it's the end," Chris said.
"Then interest reappeared at some point and it seems to have grown more and more."
Philip Steele is the secretary of the Alster Lambretta Club, which currently has 97 members, and is responsible for membership.
"Everybody's motives are different.
Some members were influenced by mod culture, as it started almost everything.
Others are race enthusiasts or rockers – here you will find all kinds of people.
There are some who are just interested in the vintage.
Many scooters have been modified, so there are no two identical ones.
It is possible not to change the scooter and to drive at 35 or 40 miles per hour calmly, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved this.
Some significantly modified scooters could probably reach speeds of up to 100 miles per hour."
During the weekend, problems occurred, and some scooters had to be started by pushing.
And although the weather in Northern Ireland is not always as pleasant as that of Lambretta's home country of Italy, this time the sun shone for the scooters in Fermana County.
Ruth Davidson asks the Tories for silence on the issue of "Brexit"
Ruth Davidson asked her Conservative colleagues for a "silence period" so that the Prime Minister could agree on "Brexit".
The head of the Scottish Tories said that within two years of the EU referendum, there was enough time for a debate.
She expressed her opinion after Boris Johnson said of the Prime Minister's plan, which he called "insane and utterly absurd".
She said to the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland that it is time to support the Prime Minister.
At a party conference in Birmingham that brought together Tory activists, she said: “We have had time for a debate over the past two years.
The former Foreign Secretary served in one of the best Cabinets in the country's history and during that period most of the current plan, which had already been recognized in November last year, was drawn up.
Conservatives must now support the Prime Minister, allow her to complete the deal and help implement the plans in the country.
I think a period of silence would be very useful."
Her comments followed a sharp criticism in the Brexito debate, which was repeatedly voiced by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later assured that she believed in Brexitu and that her cabinet plan could ensure a favourable free trade deal with the European Union.
Mr. Davidson also said that by participating in the next elections, he would pledge to prevent Scotland's second referendum on independence, because in 2014 "the Scots were promised that such an event would be the only one in their generation".
When asked about a possible repeat referendum on Brexito, she replied: "If we are talking about the history of Scotland, I have repeatedly stated that a referendum cannot be repeated if you are a nationalist and the result is not satisfactory to you.
I would hypocritically argue that another referendum on Brexito could be held because I expected a different outcome."
M8 road reopened after police incident
The M8 motorway reopened after a police incident at Glasgow.
According to police, the road was closed in both directions just before 07.00 a.m. at the intersection of 15 Townhead with concerns over the pedestrian.
Traffic on the closed road did not take place for three hours and was disrupted in the city where the Marathon Great Scottish Run is taking place.
In 20, the man was later taken to Glasgow Royal Hospital for research.
A friend of Christine'a Blasey Ford has confirmed a statement on sexual abuse alleged by Brett Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was a high school friend of Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Bretta Kavanaugh of sexual abuse when they were both teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee and explained that although she herself does not remember the party at the house during which the attack may have occurred, she believes Ford's account.
Previously, Keyser issued a statement through his lawyer that he does not remember the party in question and does not even know if he had met Kavanaugh.
While testifying against the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Kavanaugh often mentioned Keyser's statement as proof of his innocence, but did not mention Keyser's claim that she believed Ford's words.
President Trump on Friday directed the FBI to conduct an investigation within a week when Republican Senator Jeff Flake and other moderate-minded senators asked to give time for the investigation and a week to delay the entire Senate vote on Kavanaugh.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter through his lawyer to the committee stating that he wanted "as much as he could to contribute to an additional FBI investigation" on Kavanaugh.
"However, as my client has already explained, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and does not remember a party or gathering in which he would have been with or without Dr. Ford," says a letter from Keyser's lawyer Howard Walsh.
The letter goes on to explain that Keyser "doesn't reject Dr. Ford's story and has already told the press that he believes Dr. Ford's testimony."
"However, the simplest and indispensable truth is that it cannot confirm it because it does not remember the above-mentioned incident," continues the letter.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, who had allegedly been around during the assault, said he would also contribute to the FBI investigation.
Unlawfully convicted Chicagoans tell of life with corrupt policeman and his gang
The chief Illinois prosecutor is trying to change the history of the Chicago police after a dark period.
It is believed that an unscrupulous policeman exploited the innocent population of social housing and unreasonably arrested a large number of people.
So far, 42 illegally convicted people have been acquitted.
The social housing project of Ida B. Wells currently has only an empty lot left on the site, and its residents have been exploited by corrupt Chicago policemen for over a decade without fear.
They were commanded by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
Residents accused him and his tactical squad of extortion, forgery and coercion of police reports and evidence.
Willie Martin and Clean Glover are two of those convicts who have so far been acquitted by Cook County Attorney General Kim Foxx.
“If you didn’t work with him, you would end badly.
You were his enemy.
You interfered with his action and gain," Clean Glover told of Watts.
“I was very afraid.
I wanted to get out of that neighborhood,
but I had nowhere to go," stated Willie Martin.
Lawyers from Foxx ethics department review another 30-40 Wattsu-related cases.
Landon Allen, a resident of Ida B. Wells' social housing, said that many people chose not to keep quiet about Watts.
"A lot of people didn't keep quiet," he said.
"But it didn't matter."
According to another former resident, Clarissa Baker, no one believed the residents' words about the official position of sergeant.
“He has his own gang.
Who will believe in us?"
said Baker.
Joshua Tepfer, who works on the University of Chicago's acquittal project, says that to date no one really believed them.
"Everything took a long time because they didn't seem to care about these people, because they were black people living in social housing, so it was thought that they had done something wrong anyway," said Tepfer.
"Sergeant Watts went to prison for 22 months in 2013 for trying to steal FBI informants.
Martez Wise is also jailed thanks to Watts.
I had just had a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He hardly knew me because he had just been born, so I had to reconnect with him," stated Wise.
"I've lost four years unnecessarily."
The 72-year-old Fidelity believes in the success of block circuits, virtual reality and artificial intelligence
The potential of Fidelity's block chains was noticed until 2018, when all corporations started talking about this technology.
CEO Abby Johnson has led investments in cryptovalutas, the most risky and volatile asset class of recent years.
"About two years ago, I and other senior executives were just curious about what was going on, especially in the bitcoins market," said Johnson.
We started to consult, and we realized that we had to find out.
Curiosity led to the launch of "mining" bitcoins in the New Hampshire division at a cost of approximately $180 for this cryptovaluta.
Last December, the price was almost $20,000, and Johnson said, “We were surprised that when the price went up, we started earning, although we never expected it.”
It did not specify how many bitcoins it "excavated" or how much Fidelity earned.
Fidelity employees are clearly interested in these technologies.
A block chain club for employees called "Bites and Blocks", which organizes seminars and meetings with specialists, now has approximately 2,600 members.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave Fidelity customers the opportunity to check the crypto-free balance using the Fidelity mobile app.
In 2015, bitcoins were made available for donations.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible uses of bitcoins, or for at least a short time refused them.
We're trying to monitor the market.
In the meantime, Katie Chase, the chief strategist of the Fidelity Applied Technology Center and head of the Block Chain Incubator (which is part of FCAT), is looking for ways to use the public and business used block circuits.
Chase was unable to comment on specific projects, but revealed that he had received great interest from customers, partners and employees.
“Everything is still very new.
If you go into the information, you will realize that there is still an attempt to find evidence of the concept," Chase said.
We have tried to apply block circuits to various situations and we have learned a lot, but the technology is not yet so advanced that it can solve such problems."
For the time being, she says, the group is focusing more on trying to understand the nature of those obstacles.
They try to understand how to calculate the value of physical objects, such as works of art, by means of tokens, or to use block circuits in the supply chain.
"So far this is not the focus of attention, but I think it will eventually get interested," Chase said.
Fidelity will be ready for this."
As an example, she referred to the Pebble watch, which was completely unsuccessful in marketing standards, but eventually paid off by Fidelity.
Her group created an app for a smart clock that stopped production after three years, collecting millions through the Kickstarter crowdfunding project.
When Apple Watch appeared on the market, Fidelity was ready.
It quickly adapted the Pebble app for the new Apple product.
"We were not blindly convinced that the clock "Pebble" would become popular, but we wanted to be prepared if people liked smart watches," she said.
“We accumulated knowledge and were ready when smart watches were released into the mass market.”
The island of Sulawesi was devastated by an earthquake and tsunami
On Friday, September 29, a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, causing a tsunami and killing nearly 400 people.
There are numerous injured and the number of dead is expected to increase.
According to a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster management agency, electricity and communication are not working, making it difficult to assess the damage in Palu and the nearby fishing community of Dongala.
California students wore a T-shirt with racist inscriptions
According to CNN affiliate KGTV, the Escondido Schools Union confirmed this week that about 10 students made a poorly thought-out decision to demonstrate racism at an event for senior classes.
"We are proud that everyone in our school is accepted and not afraid of diversity," Adriana Lepe-Ramirez, director, said in the report.
"We will not tolerate promoting racism and exclusion."
The report also indicated that Escondido High School, union officials and local police were investigating the incident.
"School administrators have contacted the parents and guardians of wronged pupils and disciplinary penalties will be applied," the report states.
According to a report from the police station, students from a school north of San Diego wore a T-shirt with letters written literally to put up a racist inscription through a picnic for the senior classes, and were photographed wearing them.
Usually, the school pre-authenticates the notes, but after taking an official photo, some students choose their own words.
The Union report states that such behaviour is "not compatible with the culture, values or history of Escondido High School".
"We need to understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make on a daily basis," said Lepe-Ramirez.
"Escondido High School will continue to foster a culture based on family values and unity throughout the community."
Former student Cade Pannellas for the channel KGTV said that the offensive photo seen on social media angered him.
"It has offended me personally," he said.
“It may have seemed funny to them, but it is not.
Only the ignorant can laugh at such things."
Shareef, son of Shaquille O'Neal, awaiting heart surgery will miss the 1st season of UCLA
Shareef, the son of Basketball Hall of Fame member Shaquille O'Neal, will have to miss the first season of UCLA due to a heart disorder.
According to TMZ Sports, O'Neal will undergo heart surgery to correct the disorder observed by UCLA doctors during a routine examination.
"Thank God, UCLA medics noticed the problem early," O'Neal said to TMZ.
“As long as the rehabilitation takes place, I will attend lectures and be a normal student.
I'll be back very soon."
O'Neal signed an official intent protocol in August, promising to play in the UCLA team, which has already attracted a number of famous names and is one of the best freshman teams in the country for the 2018–19 season.
"Shareef has improved considerably in high school," Steve Alford, the head coach of Bruins, told reporters last month.
“He is a tall man, has skills, is athletic and will be a great member of the new team.
We are happy with the composition of this year's team and Shareef will complement it perfectly.
He has a good base and will be able to improve on both ends of the pitch."
According to 247Sports, 18-year-old O'Neal is a 4-star candidate, ranking 8th in the 2018 rookie rankings as a heavy edge striker and 41st as a player.
Before joining UCLA, O'Neal helped Crossroads High School achieve a record score of 25:9.
Sarah Palin's eldest son accused of violence against her father
Track Palin, 28, was arrested for three counts of misconduct, including assault.
He was not first arrested for domestic violence on Sunday.
According to court records, the incident occurred at Palin House in Vasila, Alaska, where Track Palin injured his father Todd to blood after arguing over a truck.
The 28-year-old was arrested following Saturday's incident on three counts of misconduct, including assault.
Court documents indicate that the dispute started when the man called to pick up the truck, but the father refused to give it to him.
As explained in a court statement, Track Palin is arrested on charges of first-degree burglary and fourth-degree assault and fourth-degree misdemeanor, and his father is wounded in the face and head.
According to the documents, Palin called the policemen talking to him "hounds" and told him not to use weapons.
The court statement also indicates that the man climbed the roof of the garage before being arrested.
The court documents record Sarah Palin's words that her son was "excited" and "used some kind of medicine".
It is also recorded that Track Palin claimed to have previously drank several bottles of beer to police.
He was arrested in early 2016 and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and possession of a gun while intoxicated.
"Seeing how my son feels, what he experiences when he returns, I understand other families going through the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and I know how injured the soldiers are returning," said the former Republican candidate for Vice President and Governor of Alaska.
"I now understand better than ever that America's best need a Commander-in-Chief who will respect and appreciate them."
Elizabeth Warren says she will think about the presidential nomination after the mid-term elections
"It is time for women to march to Washington and correct the corrupt government to be led by a woman," said the Democratic senator speaking to the crowd gathered at the Holjok Town Hall in Massachusetts.
"So I promise you this: after 6 November, you should think carefully about whether you should be a candidate for president."
Warren, who is trying to defend her post in a competition with Republican representative in the state Geoff Diehlu, previously said she would not stand for president because she wants to focus on working in the Senate.
"It is very important to focus on the mid-term elections and stop acting as if 2020 is the only important thing," she said while giving a speech to reporters at the National Press Club in August.
"The most important fight is the mid-term elections, and they are important not only in Massachusetts, but throughout the country."
Warren has long been considered a potential 2020 Democratic candidate capable of competing with President Donald Trump.
However, it would be awaited by a tough primary election struggle, possibly involving other well-known Democrats, such as former Vice President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris, and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
Third enigmatic death in less than a year linked to celebrity mental health clinic
According to The Mail, a third person committed suicide in a luxurious psychiatric clinic less than a year later.
The daughter of television comedian Shaquelle Vidal (23 years old) died on 7 April, after spending almost a month voluntarily in West London, Marylebone, located at Nightingale Hospital.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57), a hedge fund manager, millionaire and former Conservative Party supporter, paid the cost of her care for five years.
The future chief chef died almost six months after the day Daisy Boyd (28 years old), a granddaughter of Rose Gray, one of the founders of River Cafe, died.
After parting with Dan Macmillan, heir of the publishing company (43), suffering D. Boyd died on October 5 under the influence of cocaine, which was illegally brought in by a clinic visitor.
Two months ago, filming ground artist Alan MacDonald (61), who had been four days since his release from the hospital, withdrew from his life.
In May, the Care Quality Commission criticized the Nightingale Clinic because it did not make sufficient efforts to prevent the introduction of illegal substances.
The daughter of Ava Vidal, a comedian of the BBC show Mock The Week, registered at the Shaquelle Clinic on 11 March.
In a preliminary Westminster coroner's hearing last week, Royal Advocate Katie Gollop said that Shaquelle had disappeared from AWOL on March 29 and returned a week later in deteriorating mental condition.
Ms Gollop, acting on behalf of Ava Vidal, said: "My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquelle, who she was dealing with and what she was doing."
Ms. Lyle was called Shaquelle's "boyfriend".
The unofficial stepfather of Shaquelle, called comedy director John Gordillo (52), said: "I know that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at the time."
Mr.Gordillo revealed at the meeting that on 4 April Shaquelle called him and said that he wanted to buy and drink cyanide, and he called the clinic "more than a dozen times" 20 minutes after this call, but no one answered.
"It seems to me that further events could have been avoided if anyone had responded," he added.
On April 5, a clinic doctor found Shaquelle's mental condition to be extremely poor."
After less than 48 hours, she hanged herself on a laptop wire.
Nightingale spokesman expressed condolences to family and friends and said: "Our clinic aims to provide high quality care in a safe, therapeutic environment."

Led Zeppelin is again brought to trial for allegedly stolen "Stairway To Heaven" guitar riff
Led Zeppelin was sued again for the guitar riff used in the 1971 song "Stairway To Heaven", which the band allegedly stole.
Some of the British band's 1971 hit is said to be plagiarized.
The Court of Appeal dismissed the 2016 sentence that the group did not copy under the name "Spirit" of another group.
Michael Skidmore, the guitarist's trustee of "Spirit", filed the lawsuit in 2015.
It seems that litigation about the song "Stairway To Heaven" by Led Zeppelin will last a long time – just like the song itself.
The band will stand trial again on charges of stealing the 1971 ballad guitar reef.
The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected the 2016 sentence that the band did not copy the beginning of the hit from the music of the group "Spirit".
A court judge is said to have made mistakes, such as misinforming jurors about copyright laws.
The case has been referred back to the court.
Michael Skidmore, the trustee of "Spirit" guitarist Randy Wolfe, filed his first lawsuit in 2015.
The police chase in Michigan ended when a policeman drove the suspected murderer who was shooting at them
A Michigan resident suspected of his girlfriend's murder was arrested after a police chase ended after he passed over a police car.
Adam Nolin, 33, is suspected to have shot his girlfriend – Tia Mae Randall, 27, in the Michigan city of Wyoming on Thursday.
He is taken to court on Friday at the hospital, where he found himself crossing him by a police SUV car as Nolin fired at policemen in an attempt to escape on a highway where intensive traffic was taking place.
Nolin has been charged with five serious crimes, including assault to kill and fleeing the police.
"Calculation at the hospital is not a common practice, but it is not the first such case," said Captain James Maguffee of the Wyoming Police.
"It is receiving the necessary treatment, but the process of justice must also continue.
The judges often adapt so that this can be implemented."
Nolin's girlfriend's body was found on Thursday in a mobile house in the Creekside Estates neighborhood.
The mother of the two children was shot with one shot and police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
Police then issued a public warning on Nolin and gave a brief description of the man and his 1996 black Dodge pickup.
The man was spotted in his pickup and drove off onto Highway US 131 when police tried to stop him.
Nolin struck a concrete wall with the pickup, then got out of the car and let go running on the freeway.
As he was running, he fired at the chasing policemen.
A policeman boarded a police SUV car and drove Nolin from behind.
The Observer filmed the event.
Nolin is taken to the hospital in a difficult but stable condition and will remain there until he is released and transferred to Kent County Prison.
"This event showed that Western Michigan policemen risk their health in order to protect the community," said Maguffee.
"They arrested a man quite quickly and by appropriate means and we are very proud of them."
Nolin has been charged in total with two counts of assault in order to kill, and is also charged with escaping police, carrying a hidden weapon, and a serious crime committed using a firearm.
He has not yet been charged with his girlfriend's murder as an investigation is ongoing.
"Of course, we are still conducting a murder investigation, which we will soon finish so that we can submit it in time to the Kent District Attorney," Maguffee said.
The judge commended a brave man who knocked his teeth out to an intruder in his house
The judge did not spare the greatest praise for the courage of a man standing before two criminals who tried to break into his house.
Although one burglar tried to squirt him with a wooden board, David Oldham, 63, was not frightened.
A man working as a supervisor of the university territory defended himself, struck both criminals, and knocked out the teeth of one of them.
The invaders fled, but after a fight on Mr. Oldham, blood remained, according to which Craig Ford was determined and arrested four months later.
Announcing the sentence against Ford, who lost his tooth in an attempt to break into Mr. Oldham's £400,000 individual house in Ormskerk, Lancashire, the royal judge Clement Goldstone said: "You probably did not expect such a reaction from Mr. Oldham – when you disguised yourself to see only your eyes and nose, you encountered him at the house, he hit you.
He also struck your accomplice, who tried to break into the second floor and jumped off the roof.
After sentenced Ford to three years and four months in prison on Friday, the judge said: “I hope you learned two lessons.
First, David Oldham is not to be teased, and second, it is better not to start with the police.
Because of your crimes now you have one tooth less than before and you've been bitten by a dog.
It's still a small penalty."
He added: "I would like to commend Mr. Oldham for the way he responded to your actions."
Prosecutor Derek Jones said that Ford, who committed the crime, had already been convicted of another burglary in 2016 and had to serve three years in prison, but was released on parole.
Mr. Oldham told the Liverpool Royal Court that he had danced when he heard a noise near the house at around 7:00 p.m. on 5 April.
Mr. Jones said: “Mr. Oldham, who is a wealthy man, courageously left the house and resisted the accused who was walking toward him.
Fearing for his safety, he struck him in the face, thus hitting him and knocking his tooth out.
Then another intruder jumped off the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively punched him in the face."
According to Mr. Jones, the accomplice took a wooden board and tried to snatch Mr. Oldham, and Ford said, "Shoot him, he knocked my teeth out."
The commoner told Mr. Oldham, "If you let us go, we will leave" and, along with Ford, fled the scene of the crime.
Police caught Ford in a raid in a house in the Wavertree neighborhood on August 2.
Ford kicked a police dog, then he bit him in the shoulder.
It is believed that the second burglar is still at large.
Having no permanent residence at age 25, Ford pleaded guilty to burglary, beating and dangerous driving, although this is forbidden to him and he does not have a driving license.
Tory activists met Johnson with applause
Tory activists today humiliated Boris Johnson by applauding when he was called "a weak and aggressive man".
Mr. Johnson, who tries to please the common people in his uncompromising speeches on Brexit, received a strong assessment from former trade minister Digby Jones, who was also supported by the participants of the Birmingham Conference this afternoon.
David Davis also attacked Mr. Johnson because he is concerned about newspaper headlines rather than solid politics.
Speaking to MailOnline, Mr. May's ally in the cabinet of ministers added that he was simply "noisy" because he was unable to be a full leader.
The reaction came when the former Foreign Secretary attacked the Prime Minister's Chequers plan again and called it "insane" and "totally absurd".
Mr. Johnson also added that he genuinely believed in the project, and here she did not support the withdrawal in a referendum two years ago.
He also urged the government to support ambitious projects such as the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr. May retorted that her critics were playing political games and asserted that she was not bluffing and was prepared for difficult negotiations with the EU.
In an interview on Andrew Marro's BBC show, which launched the Tories Conference, Mr. May said: "I believe in Brexitus".
Former Labour Trade Minister Lord Jones, now acting independently, received the approval of the crowd by praising the prospects of "Brexito".
People applauded when he expressed his opinion about Mr. Johnson, who allegedly answered "fucking business" to the questions of concerned businessmen.
By not specifically naming Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones made it clear that he was "a weak and aggressive man".
"Business is very important, therefore, saying "fuck business", the former Foreign Secretary showed that he is really a poor and aggressive man," he said.
"I totally disagree with him."
Lord Jones also commended the reaction of Mr. May, who observed his speech in the Chamber, to the "trunks" of EU leaders heard at the Salzburg Summit, at her cabinet plan.
Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson had also criticised Mr. Johnson earlier, reminding him that he was a high-ranking government official during the Brexito negotiations.
Mr. May's ally in the cabinet of ministers told the MailOnline newspaper that the intervention is not very serious and Mr. Johnson does not have enough supporters among the Tories in parliament to be able to expel the Prime Minister.
They said: “Now such news is not very dangerous.
He's making noises, but he doesn't have enough supporters in the parliamentary party and he knows it himself.
We see a striking contrast between David Davis, who expressed his opinion respectfully, and Boris, who satisfies his personal ambitions."
Secretary of Business Greg Clark criticised Mr. Johnson, who attacked sceptical businessmen looking at Brexitas.
Speaking at the Tory Conference in Birmingham, Mr. Clark said that Mr. Johnson was "completely wrong".
He said: “I am surprised that someone at all can think that way.
There is no successful economy in the world that has no successful prosperous businesses."
In an interview with Sky News on Ridge on Sunday, Mr. Davis acknowledged that the coming months would not be easy because the EU would try to force the UK to grant many concessions.
However, he believes that the government must not give up and seek an agreement similar to the Canadian Treaty, rather than the one proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
When asked how Mr. Johnson was successful in leading the Tories, he did not miss the opportunity to sting the former Foreign Secretary.
Hiking Mr. Johnson's suggestion to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the drawbacks of British politics is politicians with fantastic ideas."
He added: "Our communication is chaotic and many of his ideas apply to headlines, but not to solid policies."
Bulgaria spent £80 million of European taxpayers' money on poor restoration
Bulgaria has spent £80 million of European taxpayers' money on the poor restoration of ancient castles, which now appear to be built of "cheese and cardboard".
The Balkan country has spent £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of bringing back the former majesty, the restoration received bullying.
Local authorities in the areas adjacent to Krakra Fortress promised to remake the wrong works.
The Bulgarian government has spent dozens of EU millions on ignorant restoration of medieval castles.
The Balkan country spent £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund to restore ancient castles and fortresses, but instead of bringing back their previous majesty, it received bullying over construction work.
Relics after costly reconstruction look like they are built of "cheese and cardboard", so they are no longer attractive to tourists.
For example, the monument guards were enraged that the medieval fortress Krakra of the western Bulgarian city of Pernik and the Roman fort Trayanovi Vrata next to Ihtiman were reconstructed using polymer concrete, commonly used for paving.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian government have privately agreed that lessons need to be learned from this failure.
"The fence is in a weeping state," said architect and monument-guardist Stella Duleva about Trayanovi Vrata.
It has stood for 16 centuries, and is now damaged."
Such a reaction came after the restoration of Krakra Fort in Pernik, so the local government promised to remove the delivered parts in 2019.
Pernik Fortress has been called a "pile of cardboard" due to unexpected modifications.
Byzantine Yailata Fort is dubbed "cheese fortress" because it was rebuilt from smooth white blocks that are not compatible with the façade affected by weather conditions.
These unsuccessful efforts coincide with the new doubts that have arisen as to how the European Union uses development funds.
A crowd of stylish bikers on their way to this year's "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" event
Hundreds of motorcyclists dressed in stylish costumes from all over the United Kingdom took to the streets on vintage motorcycles in order to raise money for the "Movember" fund.
The event is called "The Journey of a Gentleman" and is organized annually to raise money and raise public awareness about prostate cancer.
This year bikers gathered in London and 40 other parts of the United Kingdom, including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
This year's "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" events take place in the UK and 650 other cities around the world and have so far managed to raise more than $5.5 million (£4.2 million).
According to the official website of the event, 120,000 people "dressed themselves with scarves, tied up their ties, levelled their tweeds, sat on their classic and vintage-style motorcycles and allowed them to raise funds and raise awareness about the health of men, namely prostate cancer and the mental well-being of men".
The event "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" in Sydney, Australia was first organized by Mark Hawwas.
The idea was inspired by the photo of Don Draper, the character of the Mad Men series, in which he sits on a classic motorcycle dressed in his best line.
At an event in London this year, hundreds of bikers drove along the Tower Bridge, including a decorated tax dog, Sergeant Pepper.
Boris Becker, a tennis ass, revealed to have been treated for skin cancer
Boris Becker thanked doctors who had successfully removed skin cancer.
Becker's photos barely see a small patch at the sunglasses.
"It was a routine check and it looks worse than it really is," he told the German newspaper.
After revealing that he had been treated for skin cancer, tennis legend Boris Becker was photographed with a patch on his nose.
On Wednesday, he posted a German-language Twitter message about his health: "I want to thank Martina Mayr-Brune and Dr. Kati Maier from Munich, who managed to cure me."
Pictures of the 50th anniversary taken on Sunday barely see a small patch at sunglasses.
“On Monday I visited a dermatologist who removed basal cell carcinoma for me,” said Becker to the German publication Image.
"It was a routine check and it looks worse than it really is."
Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, occurring in 75% of cases.
Once set in time, there is a good chance of recovery.
Becker is currently divorced from his wife, Lilly Becker (42), and they reported on the divorce in May.
The tennis star has won six important awards in unit competitions, 13 Masters Series titles and an Olympic gold medal in two events.
He was recently seen entertaining with friends at the 185th Oktoberfest in Munich.
Body volumes on the platform of a stranger train caused a 24-year-old hammer thrower to remain silent
A British athlete attacked by a stranger on the train platform because of body volumes decided not to remain silent.
Jessica Mayho, who has won a silver medal at this year's British Athletics Championship, says the former is attacked on Friday afternoon at Leeds Station.
Mr. Mayho, 24 years old and five feet 11 inches tall, said that while waiting for the train, she was pushed and verbally offended by a man.
At approximately 5 p.m. on the platform, the man who attacked the athlete called her "thick".
However, the rising sports star, seeking a place on the British team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, retorted her husband.
Mr. Mayho, from Kitley, West Yorkshire, said: “I defended myself until other people turned their eyes on a full platform.
Such people may be intimidated and forced to lose confidence in themselves, but this is MY body, MY "mechanism".
After announcing her adventure on Twitter, the young athlete received a great deal of support on social media.
Andy Lewis, a cavalier of the Order of the MBE, wrote: “Stora!!
Is he drunk or blind?
It's a fool – Jesse, you're all right.
Don't let a dumb-headed idiot ruin your mood."
Gavin Gray added: “I am disgusting.
Not only for him, but for those around him who ignored him.
I'm glad you're okay.
You're an example to the young generation.
You showed me you have to be proud of yourself, and the dissatisfied can fuck off!"
Mrs. Mayho, who works at the University of Leeds, took an interest in throwing a hammer in her teens, encouraged by one of her elder sister's coaches.
Since then, she has been able to win second place in Muller's British Senior Championship, which took place in Birmingham in July this year.
She won the British Championship medal just a month after winning the Northern England Games.
Athlete declined to comment more extensively on the event.
Hacking accounts of at least 50 million users will result in Facebook paying a fine of £1.25 billion
Using the security gap, criminals have been able to access at least 50 million Facebook accounts.
However, large-scale hacking was not reported until three days later – Friday.
Facebook is now facing a huge fine under new European data laws
If at least 50 million accounts are broken, Facebook may have to pay a fine of £1.25 billion.
Criminals were able to access accounts due to a security gap, which may have resulted in many sensitive personal information being revealed.
However, Facebook only reported the burglary on Friday, three days later, and until yesterday evening it could not tell how many British accounts were broken.
While the search for hackers continues, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks the compliance of a web giant with European data compliance requirements as its headquarters is located in Dublin, criticised the company saying: "The report is incomplete."
Facebook is facing a huge fine under the new data laws of the European Union, as companies may be required to pay up to four percent of global turnover.
Last year, Facebook earned £31.2 billion in revenue.
The criminals reached their accounts using the Facebook View How function, allowing users to see what their profiles look like to others.

The MG Baltic case continues to listen to records: defendants discussed Gabriel Landsbergis
The hearing started with an audition of the recording of a conversation (held in November 2015) between former vice-president of MG Baltic Raimondas Kurlianskis and former "worker" Vytautas Gapši.
Listening to the record makes it difficult to understand exactly what those currently indicted are talking about.
It is true that the record says that R. Kurlianskis and V. Gapšys are talking about Christmas celebration, several times the surname of the current Conservative leader Gabrielius Landsbergis is sounded, but what exactly is said is difficult to understand.
The charges have been filed against both natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, three legal and five natural persons were indicted: Labour and Liberal Movement parties, concern MG Baltic, former Liberal and "Workers" leaders E. Masiulis, Vytautas Gapšys, former Liberal MP Š. Gustainis, Seimas Member G. Steponavičius and former Vice President R. Kurlianskis of MG Baltic.
The Labour Party has allegations of bribery and trade effects, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade in effects and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade in effects of these parties.
Officials suspect that politicians started or agreed on bribes with the then Vice President of MG Baltic, R. Kurlianskis, and later suggested or supported initiatives in favour of the Group in the Seimas and other institutions.
Former chairman of the Liberal Movement E. Masiulis is suspected of trade effects, bribery and illegal enrichment, former vice-president of this party G. Steponavičius is suspected of abuse, former Vilnius City Council member Š. Gustainis is suspected of bribery.
V. Gapšys is suspected of the effects of bribery and trade, R. Kurlianskis is suspected of the effects of bribery and trade.
Poll: Who has the greatest chance of winning in the second round of the presidential election?
The poll on the second round of elections included four candidates in the top of the rankings - economist Gitanas Nausėda, unproclaimed Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis and two candidates from the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) party in the primary elections - Seimas member Ingrida Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ušackas.
It is true that I. Šimonytė received TS-LKD support in the elections on Sunday, and V. Ušackas withdrew from the electoral struggle.
According to the data, if elections were held in the near future, G. Nausėda would win in all cases in the second round of the President, but the head of "Vilmorus", sociologist Vladas Gaidys says that it is too early to draw conclusions.
"It stands out (from others - DELFI) Nauseda, but it's very important to watch whether about parties when talking about, or about people what dynamics are.
This Shimonytė's doubles were from one study to another, and Nauseda's had a halted growth, and Ussack's even decline was.
It's very important to you growth," says the sociologist.
Moreover, looking at the results of the polls, it is clear that a significant percentage of people have not yet decided what they will vote for or think not to go to elections at all.
If I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernelis fought in the second round of the presidential election, the fight would be tense - 32.7% would vote for I. Šimonytė, 30.9% for S. Skvernelis.
It is true that as many as 36.4% of people responded that they would not vote for any of these candidates, either did not know which one they would vote for, or did not go to elections.
Sociologist V. Gaidys stressed once again that we are not seeing a complete picture yet, because all the candidates who would apply to the electorate of less successful Lithuania have not yet declared themselves.
"If we look at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where is the Social Democratic candidate? 30 years was the candidate, won't there be now?
When he declares himself, then he will see how his chances with the other candidates are determined.
Thus, the Lithuanian side, which is less successful, is less reflected so far," said V. Gaidys.
For his part, Mažvydas Jastramskis, political scientist at the Vilnius University Institute of International Relations and Political Science (VU TSPMI), says that it is still very early to draw conclusions, and all three candidates, after rejecting V. Ušackas who left the fight, seem to be at an early stage.
"I can tell from my research experience that these differences mean nothing.
The difference of 5 percentage points certainly does not represent an advantage for any candidate.
The only thing I could see is that Nausseda would look good against Ussack (...) again, considering if those people came to a real vote.
The Naussėda v Skvernelis also looks good, but we compare the apples and potatoes now, because, for example, Naussėda has already announced that he will be present, Skvernelis has not announced.
In addition, the poll was taken before the primary Conservative election, what would it look like after it?" says the political scientist.
According to him, Mr Nausėda has a small plus, but once all the candidates have declared themselves, he may melt down.
"The situation is quite even.
Nausėda, Skvernelis, Šimonytė - results are approx.
I would like to remind you that half a year before the 2003 presidential election, Roland Pax had 5% support to vote for him and then won the election.
This is no prediction to be made," said Mr Jastramski.
DELFI recalls that economist G. Nausėda, Seimas Member I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, Seimas Member Aušra Maldeikienė, Liberal Movement Member Petras Auštrevičius, Seimas Member Naglis Puteikis and European Parliament Member Valentinas Mazuronis have already declared themselves candidates in the presidential elections.
Iran accuses Israel of attempting a cyber-attack
"A regime whose history of using cyber weapons is clear from cases such as (computer virus) Stuxnet (dissemination) has this time attempted to violate Iran's communications infrastructure," information minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi wrote on Twitter.
He was referring to the Stuxnet virus attack in 2010, which caused damage to Iranian nuclear facilities.
This malware is believed to have been developed by Israel and the United States.
"Because of the vigilance of our technical teams, they remained empty-handed.
We will continue to speak about this hostile action in international fora," Mr Jahromi stressed.
Deputy Minister Hamid Fattahi said that technical teams recorded many attempts to penetrate their systems in the morning on Monday, but that the attackers were "given a sturdy retaliation".
At the health club Impuls, my husband got sick, he couldn't be revived.
The disaster occurred around 10:40 a.m.
The man who was swimming in the pool (born 1945) suddenly became ill, and he fell underwater.
The man was quickly pulled out of the water, but he was already unconscious.
An attempt was made to revive him.
Soon thereafter, ambulance medics tried to revive him, but they failed to save his life.
On his way to the hospital, he died in an ambulance.
Antanas Sakalauskas, head of "Impuls" network of health clubs, commented on the disaster.
"According to our data, a 73-year-old man visited our wellness club, Fabijoniškių str.
In the swimming pool, the customer sailed for about 30 minutes, then swam to the lane separating the swimming pool tracks to rest, and then collapsed unexpectedly a few minutes later.
Nearby people - a customer who swam on a shared path and a pool supervisor - immediately reacted, pulled it out of the water and began to refresh it.
The man was constantly revived until an ambulance arrived.
The club's staff immediately called an ambulance, which arrived within 5 minutes.
Upon arrival, the medics rebuilt the man's pulse and breath and moved him to the medical car.
While going to the hospital, the doctors tried to stabilize the man’s health, but unfortunately after 20 minutes, we received information that the man had not survived.
We offer our sincere condolences to the family of the deceased man for the loss.
Originally, the incident may have been caused by the client's health problems.
According to information provided to family medics, he had diabetes mellitus.
We remind you that in case of serious health problems, it is always very important to carefully assess your options and consult doctors and health club specialists.
All wellness clubs in the pool facilities have a watchful caretaker, whose main task is to monitor the pool, its access and ensure the safety of customers, and it is distinguished from other employees by its bright clothing.
Such pool keepers shall have radio stations that allow immediate contact with the administration and reception, to answer their enquiries, or to call for assistance.
Four times a year there are staff trainings relating to the security programme - much more often than required by law.
They shall include the development of theoretical and practical knowledge, training in disaster management, monitoring of staff compliance with procedures and internal rules.
How Portugal has radically solved the problem of heroin

Gražina, who lost her son in Norway, has replaced four families and no longer speaks Lithuanian
According to the LNK press release, four years ago the Lithuanian woman lost the right to take care of her son and to be seen with him by the decision of the Norwegian Children's Rights Authority Barnevernet and the courts.
The woman's story caused almost an international scandal, which was followed by all the media.
Nationals have been preparing pickets for the boy's return to Lithuania for his grandmother in Lithuania and Norway.
However, publicity did not help Gražina and her family to recover their son with Lithuanian citizenship.
Today, the woman relates how she lived separated from her son for the past few years, and how the meetings between her and the child are held after a two - year break.
By the time Gražina lost the right to care for her son, the boy was 8 years old, 12 years old today.
For the first two years, Gražina never saw her son, which was forbidden.
Gražina was later granted the right to see her son twice a year, just one hour each.
During the last hearing, which took place a few months ago, the number of dates for Lithuanians was increased to three times a year and increased to two hours.
Meetings with my son every time remind me of dates in a hard-line prison - under the supervision of officials, and going to them is a secret operation.
"The son has changed four families and no longer speaks Lithuanian," Gražina will open her heart this Tuesday night, her story - on LNK show
Eligijus Masiulis will not be refunded personal money taken during the search
The Court of Appeal announced on Tuesday that it was rejecting the accused's lawyer's complaint.
The order shall be final and not subject to appeal.
In the case of political corruption, E. Masiulis, the former leader of the Liberal Movement, appealed to the Court of Appeal to refund any personal money - money taken from his and his spouse's money during the search.
In total, more than 242 thousand euros were taken from Masiulis during searches.
These moneys are subject to a temporary restriction of ownership and are constantly renewed.
The last time, Vilnius Regional Court extended it on 15 October.
Mr Masiulis has not asked the Court of Appeal to refund all the money - he is seeking to recover the EUR 800 taken from his spouse's wallet and his purse - EUR 690, £130 in the United Kingdom, and $1600.
A former politician says the latter money was allocated to a U.S. planned trip.
At the hearing of the Court of Appeal on Monday, Mindaugas Bluvas, the lawyer of E. Masiulis, asked for this money to be refunded because the spouses worked well paid jobs and had the opportunity to have such sums.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius asked the court to dismiss the complaint.
"The ruling of the Vilnius Regional Court is lawful and justified, there is no further limitation of the assets specified in the submitted indictments.
The court has rightly stated that it forms the basis for the confiscation of property, as well as the confiscation of extended property," Laucius said at the hearing.
On 15 October Vilnius Regional Court decided not to refund more than 242 thousand euros to the accused in the political corruption case E. Masiulis.
This money has been found in the home and car of a former politician who has received corruption charges during a search.
The three-judge panel held that it was clear from the case-file that property rights were restricted only to funds which constituted the subject matter of the criminal acts alleged against Masiulis.
"Having regard to the extent of the restriction, it must be concluded that the accused's right of ownership is not restricted disproportionately or the restriction is applied for too long," says Nijolė Žimkienė, Jurgita Kolyčiene and Ugnius Trumpulis in the ruling.
The judges pointed out that in the case Masiulis is accused of committing serious crimes, the criminal proceedings are large and complex, so in order to ensure possible confiscation of property and extended confiscation of property, it is necessary to extend the defendant's temporary term of limitation of property.
Prosecutors say that former vice-president of MG Baltic Group Raimondas Kurlianskis gave a bribe of 106,000 euros to E. Masiulis for making useful decisions for the concern in the Seimas.
Both defendants claim that the money found at Masiulis' house - 90 thousand euros - was a loan from Mr Kurlianski.
According to the file, 242.4 thousand euros, £130 UK and $1.6 thousand were found during searches with Masiul.
Mr Masiulis and his lawyer repeatedly tried to recover the money, but the courts rejected their requests.
A former politician has said that some of these funds belong to other persons and were intended to invest in real estate or are his family's money.
He also claimed that there was no evidence that the funds would be obtained criminally.
Previously, the Court of Appeal has announced that the accusations against Masiulis show that these funds could have been obtained by accepting a bribe of more than EUR 100 000.
Law enforcement claims that the remaining cash taken during the search could have been obtained from unidentified sources of income, undeclared, undocumented and possibly not legal income.
In the case of political corruption, three legal persons - the Labour Party, the Liberal Movement, and the MG Baltic Group - were indicted.
In addition to E. Masiulis, the case brought charges against former "worker" Vytautas Gapšas, former Liberal MP Šarūnas Gustanis, Seimas Member Gintaras Steponavičius and former Vice President of MG Baltic R. Kurlianskis.
Kurlianskis is accused of giving bribes to former parliamentarians E. Masiulis, Š. Gustainis and V. Gapšys.
Americans captured dangerous Russian fighter maneuvers
During the 25-minute takeover, according to the U.S. Navy, Russian SU-27 rushed straight past the plane's front.
The Russian aircraft passed through it for a second time, using traction acceleration, and made a turn with tilt.
Passengers reported feeling turbulence during the first approach and a quake during the second approach.
The Russian military has the right to conduct exercises in the international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We expect international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents consistent with conduct, including the 1972 Agreement on Preventing Incidents at Sea and Over Sea (INCSEA)," the U.S. naval forces said in their report.
"Unsafe actions increase the risk of miscalculation and potential collisions," the report notes.
The Russian Ministry of Defence acknowledged the incident, but assured that Russian SU-27 held a "safe distance" from an American plane.
Parental expenditure continues to decrease: only EUR 50 per month for extracurricular activities
According to a survey conducted by the market and public opinion research company "Baltic Research" in late August, the survey revealed that a third (32%) of parents contributed less than 100 euros to the "buying" of their single school-age child before school this year, a fifth (21%) spent between 101 and 150 euros, three out of ten (29%) spent between 151 and 200 euros, and just under one fifth (18%) spent more than 200 euros on the preparation of one of their children for school at the end of summer.
Parents whose children started first grade this school year spent an average of about 220 euros on their child's school basket, while other parents whose children have already finished first grade paid a lower amount to prepare their child - an average of about 160 euros.
However, as the school year progresses, there is no reduction in costs, since parents often have to flatten out money for child groups and cardepetrators.
Depending on the type of activity, the price per unit in the country can vary from 20 to 100 euros.
Parents who have children of school age were asked to tell them what average monthly amount they plan to spend on extracurricular employment for their one child.
A quarter (23%) of the respondents planned to allocate up to 20 euros per month for after-school activities, a further quarter (26%) said they had studied up to 50 euros, three out of ten (31%) contributed between 50 and 100 euros per month for extracurricular employment of the child, while a sixth (17%) of the parents indicated that they planned to allocate 100 euros or more for this purpose.
It is true that in Lithuania children of school age are assigned a non-formal children's education basket, which consists of 15 euros per month.
However, this money can only be used for one group, and if the cost of an occupation is higher, the difference must be borne by the parents.
In the case of a child who attends several groups or has several children of school age, the cost of extracurricular activities may double.
According to Justina Ambrasienė, the marketing manager of the consumer loan company Vivus.lt, a low- or middle-income family can save on child groups, especially when several children are growing up in the family, and can become a big challenge.
At the start of the school year, parents turned their heads where to get money for exercise, stationery, or new sportswear.
Now the main concern is how to take children after school without spending a bunch of money on it.
We note that parents' costs are particularly high in August, when proper preparation for the new school year is needed, but they remain higher later than in the summer period, as parents tend to invest in the employment of their children.
Often, having lacked funds and responsibly assessed their possibilities, they are determined and borrowed," says J.Ambrasienė.

The fourth painted trolleybus cheers the Kaunas residents
Today, the fourth exhibit of the mobile street exhibition "Atia antiquities, hello news" - the old trolleybus was decorated with a drawing and inscription "Sienographer's Inscriptions".
The new fun trolleybus was announced by Kaunas City Municipality.
"This old woman Škoda also changed her slightly bloated green colour into a much more colorful and brighter garment.
She also participates in the exhibition "Bye-to-elderly, good news!" - the representatives of the municipality write at the uploaded photo.
Mobile street art exhibition "Bya antiquities, good news" is dedicated to farewell to the old trolleybuses, which will be replaced by new ones next year.
Already next year, the old Škoda trolleybuses will travel for their earned rest, they will be replaced by 85 newcomers and modern Solaris trolleybuses.
The portal reminds that the first trolleybus printed with street drawings rolled into the streets of Kaunas a month ago.
The trolleybus shows several well-known accents of Kaunas street art - grandfather pipe and elephant.
Less than a week after the first performance, the second piece of street artist Timomtiejus Norvila - Morfai also rolled out to the streets of Kaunas.
The trolleybus features a jolly yellow car, which is often referred to simply as a "beet".
"Wanted to get the trolleybus in.
This drawing looks very entertaining, especially because it also meets the wheels of the trolleybus.
When the wheels turn on the turn, it seems to be part of that car.
When we painted the wheels in white, we made them sort of retro-style, so the whole combination sounded very loud.
Until the trolleybus tires were painted, it really didn't look so charming," the street artist spoke to the portal kauno.diena.lt a little earlier.
And on October 27, a remarkable drawing lay down on the third trolleybus as well.
It is decorated with white, yellow, orange, brown, but mostly blue.
This color is dominant.
On the left side of the trolleybus body is shown one home of K.Donelaicio St., on the right - the central post office.
"The bug is the sweetest thing to me for now," Morphes said to the third trolleybus by printing the artist Morph.
Buys new ones
Kaunas Day recalls that last week Kaunas Public Transport Management Company Kauno Bus signed an agreement of 29.4 million with Polish company Solaris Bus & Coach S.A indicating that Kaunas will purchase 85 new trolleybuses.
"Kaunas invests the largest amount in its history to upgrade public transport.
This agreement will allow us to replace the old trolleybuses of Škoda brand that have served us for many years and offer passengers the most comfortable services.
The new low-floored state-of-the-art trolleybuses will have more seats, efficient cabin conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver’s workplace.
New equipment and parallel works of contact network renewal and street repair will allow trolleybuses to travel more reliably, much faster.
And, undoubtedly, the trolleybuses of the modern design greatly decorate the city," said Mindaugas Grigelis, CEO of Kauno Buses.
The first new trolleybuses will reach Kaunas in August next year, and all old trolleybuses will be replaced by December.
Santa Sensation: Queen Elizabeth II invited Mrs Markle's mother together to celebrate
Duchess Meghan charmed the British royal palace.
This is proved by the special gesture of Queen Elizabeth II: the British monarch invited Doria Ragland, the mother of the Duchess of Sussex, to her Sandringam Palace for Christmas, by the British media.
Even the parents of Duchess Kate have not received such honor.
Kate's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, and other members of her family, have so far only been invited to traditional Christmas services with the royal family.
An unnamed source for the Sunday Express newspaper revealed that the invitation to Doria Raglabd was "a sign of Queen's respect for Meghan".
Doria said that at the royal wedding in May, she bewitched the queen "with her composure".
The invitation to celebrate Christmas together, in addition to inciting speeches that Mr Ragland is planning a longer stay in Britain.
It is speculated that she wants to help her daughter before and after giving birth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, should be born a firstborn in the spring of 2019.
The exhibition "Woman's World" will be held in Žalgiris Arena again
With autumn routines and harsher weather, the 16th edition of the exhibition "Woman's World" makes women eager to announce the long weekend, because even four days of hottest fashion, style and beauty news are right here - on 8-11 November, at Kaunas Žalgiris Arena.
Over the years, to see how the face of the event changes, the exhibition means no longer ordinary shopping, but a tradition of giving time to yourself.
It often becomes a meeting place for friends and a reason to spend the day with a sister or mother.
The four days of the exhibition have a special power - every woman here can learn the secrets of charm, learn tricks, how to look glowing daily, find indispensable products, hear or test various procedures that stop the skin from aging.
All this and more, promises as many as 415 participants of the exhibition, who will wait for visitors on all three floors of the arena.
Three days of seminars on beauty and health will be held, and on Sunday representatives of the fine sex will be able to hear advice to create an exclusive image from the lips of the stylist and blogger Viktorija Šaulytė.
A large proportion of women rotating in business face marginal situations where stress begins to interfere with stable emotional and physical condition.
For this reason, Kaunas Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Crafts and the Business Women's Network operating there have been born the idea of holding a conference "Business and happy. No stress" where discussions and practical examples will encourage you to help yourself in stressful situations and encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
As every year, the exhibition is full of events for beauty masters.
The exhibition's long-standing partners, the association of hairdressers and beauty professionals, will provide two days to learn the subtleties of hair coloring and modeling from the charismatic duo formed by the international academy Vinokourov & friends - S. Maslov and R. Sakalauskas.
Those seeking to improve even more will be awaited by the bride's image creation contest and the mastery fight Art Battle, which will not leave the indifferent.
It is as if the cherry on the cake will become a festive fiesta of the beauty world "Happy Birthday, Lithuania", where on the occasion of the centenary you will be able to see a show that has not yet been seen - from body painting to dance.
Another tradition of "Woman's World" will not be forgotten, but the latest collections of designers will be presented on Friday's "Fashion and Beauty Show", where the most stylish will be chosen.
And supporters of handicrafts will be welcome in the "Dekostudios" workshop, where they will be able to create original items for the interior of the house or to decorate gifts more interestingly.
On the last day of the exhibition, all long-neckeds are particularly welcome, as traditionally visitors will be welcomed by the competition "World Long-haired LONG-HAIRED WORLD 2018", where new records of the longest box office are recorded each year.
Prime Minister: teachers' salary increased by 117 euros after introduction of full-time pay
Since the introduction of the full-time pay model in September, the average salaries of country's full-time educators have increased by 117 euros, Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis confirms.
"It is early to say how much it (new order - BNS) has advantages or disadvantages.
The fact is that those people who have a full workload - their salaries have increased by more than 117 euros on average," S. Skvernelis told reporters in the Government on Monday.
He called the plans of the Lithuanian Union of Education Workers to carry out a strike on full-time payment a "democratic right", but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the process of education.
"In a democratic country, all forms of protest are permissible, possible.
If it is thought that a strike is needed, it is their right to self-determination.
Once again, children and students would not want to be harmed in this place.
If the strike is to take place, it must be carried out in accordance with the laws in force," said Mr Skvernelis.
In June, the Seimas approved the model of full-time teacher pay, and it is introduced in stages from September.
The teaching allowance was replaced by an hourly payment - the teacher's post consists of 1512 hours per year.
Teacher's working time is divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation for them and work for the community.
This reform is described as absurd by the trade union led by Andrius Navickas, resentful of its adoption of the "bulldozer" principle and announcing the launch of an indefinite strike on 12 November.
The FTAS requires the immediate abandonment of this "minimum" wage system and the introduction of a full-time model with a maximum number of 18 contact hours per post.
Also - increase the coefficients of the fixed part of the basic salary by 20% and reduce the number of children in the classes.
Among other innovations, the introduction of a new methodology for allocating teaching funds is criticised because, according to the trade union, there is insufficient funds to divide home training, classrooms into groups, qualifications, and educational assistance, and classrooms in large cities have remained overcrowded as they were.
The Ministry of Education and Science said that full-time payment of teachers' work will allow the workloads of educators to be regularized and rewarded for all the work to the school community.
It is planned that the teaching staff will be able to work for the community up to half of the total number of hours a year, and up to 40% of the total number of hours in the first two years of work.
Teachers shall have a working time of 36 hours per week, of which no more than 24 contact points per week for the training of mandatory subjects.
In May, about half a hundred general education schools, kindergartens and non-formal education institutions, and about 1 thousand educators contributed to the two-hour strike initiated by the FTAS.
In total, there are about 53 thousand educators in Lithuania.
Call for readiness: crisis can be expected in 2-3 years
The slowdown in economic growth and even the crisis can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government are much more prepared for these processes than a decade ago, Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania, said in an interview for the News Radio programme "Business Position".
"I would certainly not be able to say that the crisis is already around the corner, but there are certainly signs of a slowdown in the economy.
This year our country's economy grew by more than 3 percent, and next year we are planning a 2.8 percent growth.
The main message I would like to say to the public and business - let us be ready for everything," V. Vasiliauskas said.
He felt that crises were not the same, and that they needed to be prepared differently.
The difference from the crisis of a decade ago is that at the time, the government thought that the income generated by the growing economy would be eternal, and that was the expenditure planned.
As a result, when the crisis hit in 2008, we had to cut costs drastically.
Now, according to Vasiliauskas, the situation is different and the crisis is better prepared.
"It is true that the assessment of the situation of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance is different.
We believe that we are already beyond potential and need to press brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not think so," the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania said.
V. Vasiliauskas evaluates the preparation of the country's institutions for the upcoming crisis by 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, an economy as small and open as that of Lithuania is heavily influenced by external factors.
The current shoving of the big elephants - the US, China, the European Union - will undoubtedly affect us too.
We therefore need to be very careful.
With little economy to say that we decide everything, it is possible, but I do not believe it," V. Vasiliauskas said.
What will the future hold for those who have taken large loans?
According to V. Vasiliauskas, the European Central Bank has a clear short-term strategy, and decisions on interest changes can be expected no sooner than next summer: "At the moment, perhaps the main goal is to try to manage expectations".
The trend, which is most worrying for the head of the Bank of Lithuania, is the reduction in the number of working hands in our country.
"The decline of the labour force is also a significant factor in the decline of the competitiveness of the economy.
It is also a reduction in bread eaters.
Migration this year allowed to balance this process a little, but it is not sure if this is a long-term trend," V. Vasiliauskas believes.
ELTA reminds that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy will grow by 3.4% this year, and by 2.8% next year.
The Swedish Conservative leader will again try to shape the government
The leader of Sweden, which has been in a political stalemate for two months since the election, the conservative Moderate Party will receive a second chance to form a government, was announced by the Speaker of Parliament on Monday.
Ulf Christersson's (Ulf Christerson's) Moderate Party belongs to the four-center-right party Alliance, which received slightly less votes than the previous ruling centre-left coalition during the September 9 election.
It was difficult for both blocs to bring together the majority by refusing to consult with the anti-immigration Swedish Democratic Party, whose origins are in the neo-Nazi movement.
Mr Kristersson's first attempt to form a government on October 14 was unsuccessful.
On October 29, outgoing Prime Minister Stefan Lofwen (Stefan Lioven) also announced his failed attempt.
In an attempt to get the parties to agree, Parliamentary Speaker Andreas Norlen said that he would propose U. Kristersson to parliament next week as a candidate for premiership, thus pushing the first vote since government formation efforts began.
"It is unclear in advance whether the various parties will accept Ulf Kristersson as premier," Mr Norlen told reporters.
However, he stressed that "the process must move forward, and the dynamics between the parties must change".
"Fairless negotiations must end," he added.
Parliament's voting date is not yet clear, but Mr Norlen said November 14 was among the possible dates.
In Sweden, the Speaker of Parliament may, on four occasions, instruct any candidate to form a government with which the parliament would agree.
If all four attempts are unsuccessful, the country must hold a new election.
The current appointment of U. Kristersson is Norlen's third attempt.
Some Moderate parties and groups of Christian Democrats in the Alliance partners are pressured by U. Kristersson to accept the support of the far-right Swedish Democratic Party, but he for the time being rejects this possibility.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6% of the vote in the election and is the third largest party, all major current parties have long ignored.
The ultra-right party, which successfully took advantage of voter anger over immigration during the elections after nearly 400,000 asylum seekers have arrived in the country since 2012, demands influence in decision-making in exchange for support.
However, members of the Alliance, liberals and centrists, are categorically opposed to such an idea.
S. Lofven's Swedish Social Democratic Labour Party (SAP), which has ruled with the support of the Greens and the informal Left since 2014, has, in the meantime, created opportunities for cooperation between the blocs, but only if he retains the post of Prime Minister.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party rejected such a possibility.
Afghan government delegation to take part in peace talks in Russia
A delegation from the Kabul government will participate in the international talks on peace war-torn Afghanistan held in Russia this month, officials reported on Monday.
The Taliban, in turn, is still considering whether to participate.
Russia announced on Saturday that it would hold such a conference in Moscow on November 9, although the U.S. is currently trying to establish bilateral talks with the Taliban to end the 17-year conflict.
The Afghan government's High Peace Council, responsible for the efforts of reconciliation with militants, will send four representatives to the meeting in Moscow, spokesman Sayed Ihsan Taheri (Sajid Ihsan Taher) told AFP news agency.
However, the Afghan Foreign Ministry has avoided responding to whether it will send its delegation to this conference, which will focus on initiating peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still negotiating with Russian officials," said spokesman Sebaghtullah Ahmadi (Sebagtula Ahmadis). - We welcome any peace effort led by the Afghans.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid (Zabiula Mujahid) said the movement is still considering whether to proceed.
Moscow also invited representatives from the United States, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet republics of central Asia.
Pakistan, long accused of supporting the Afghan Taliban, "will necessarily be present", AFP said Foreign Ministry spokesman Muhammad Faisal (Muhamad Faisal).
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has not yet responded to a request for comment.
Originally a meeting in Moscow was planned for September, but was delayed by Kabul's demand that the process be led by Afghans.
The negotiations will take place in a sensitive time.
The newly appointed U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad (Zalmay Chalylzad) attempts to convince the Taliban to agree to negotiate the conclusion of the war and fears that a multilateral meeting in Russia could disrupt these efforts.
A U.S. government oversight authority indicated last week that Kabul government power in Afghanistan has weakened in recent months.
Cuban President met with North Korean leader in Pyongyang
North Korean leader Kim Jong Unas and Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel, both of whom hope to lift U.S. economic sanctions, agreed to expand and strengthen their country's strategic relations, North Korean state media reported on Monday.
Mr Diaz-Canel, who arrived in Asia continuing his first international trip after coming to power in April, flew to Pyongyang with his wife on Sunday.
At the airport, he was met by Kim Jong Unas; the leaders drove into the city together to welcome the crowds through them.
North Korean state media reported that leaders held talks at the state guest house "Paekhwawon", highlighted the general socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide much detail, but indicated that the atmosphere of the negotiations was friendly.
The meeting with Kim Jong Unu could be seen as a warning to Washington, D.C., whose efforts to secure significant progress on the issue of North Korean denuclearization are increasingly stalling.
Pyongyang, who has also been seeking Moscow's favour lately, tightens up the rhetoric ahead of this week's planned meeting between US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Maiko Pompey) and North Korea's main negotiator Kim Yong Cholo (Kim Jong Cholo) in New York.
On the weekend, Pyongyang criticized the U.S. through its official media for irrevocable sanctions - a political tool that Washington also used extensively against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea has hinted that it could further develop the nuclear weapons program if Washington did not change course.
Sanctions are an important item on Mr Diazo-Canel's agenda.
While visiting Moscow last week, Mr Diaz-Canel discussed an arms contract worth almost $50 million (EUR 43.8 million) with Russia and received a similar promise from Vladimir Putin to expand political, economic and military ties.
The two presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the U.S.'s "interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states."
The U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, originally introduced in 1958 and later extended, remains in force.
Russia has been severely sanctioned by the US and the European Union as a result of the annexation of Crimea and support for the separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
Mr Diaz-Canel is due to leave Pyongyang on Tuesday.
He will still visit China, Vietnam and Laos.
In storage areas - cars unsafe?
On Saturday, the woman appealed to police officers to clear up this case of fraud.
According to Klaipėdiete, in 2006 the "Hyundai Santa Fe" brand car was left in the parking lot for storage at the end of September.
She noticed the announcement on the website on November 3.
Turns out, the scammers were trying to sell her vehicle for €3,800.
According to the owner, the car may have been stolen.
The vehicle was attempted for sale by a man born in 1989.
According to police, the person is not the owner of the site.
An investigation shall be carried out in the course of which the circumstances of the crime will be investigated.
As firefighters announce, a fire broke out on Banduchi Street, the seventh floor of the apartment, on Sunday evening at about 10:00 p.m.
The one-room apartment was filled with trash and a sofa standing in the room.
The owner was taken out of the apartment and examined by medics, police reported.
Incinerated and incensed objects were thrown out of the window in the apartment.
During the fire, a seventh-floor stairwell walls are smoked.
Record: Athlete sailed around Britain in 157 days
The British Athlete went off the sea to shore on Sunday in England, becoming the first person to circumnavigate Great Britain along the coast.
Ross Edgley, 33, spent 157 days in the water and beat 2,883 kilometres.
He would sail for six hours each, and lodge on the support team ship that accompanied him.
For the last mile, the athlete overcame accompanied by hundreds of fellow swimmers.
He went ashore in Margate in south-east England - it was here that Mr Edgley began his journey on 1 June.
The sportsman, who planned to make it within 100 days, told the relatives who met him on the shore, "I'm sorry, I'm late."
He said he felt relief first when he got ashore.
"I was very worried that my legs would not stand," said the athlete.
The World Open Water Swimming Association pointed out that during this endurance test, which was sponsored by the energy drink Red Bull producer, Mr Edgley had to face extremely adverse weather conditions on a number of occasions, and that the athlete had been stingy by jellyfish as many as 37 times.
Organizers announce that Mr. Edgley has doubled the record for longest intermittent seaboarding, which has so far been 73 days.
He also reached a new record, likely overcoming the distance between Britain's southernmost and northernmost points - Lands End Point and John O'Grouts.
The athlete overcame this distance in 62 days.
Makabrysh secret of the Kleboniškis forest: one suspect has already been detained
It was a horrific find by a passerby, as the murdered one was buried shallowly.
It was only under these circumstances that this crime was discovered because the killer victim had no relatives and his disappearance was not reported.
Originally, he was not too old to reach adulthood.
Like the suspects of his murder.
One of them was allowed to be arrested last week by the Kaunas District Court for three months.
The second, who is suspected of having fled abroad, where he is hiding from his sentence for another crime, is still being sought.
Until it is found, law enforcement are not inclined to comment on the circumstances of this crime any more.
I. Valinskienė: I would accept many things for my children
The ranks of the most prominent performers in the country to appear in the new production rock opera Love and Death in Verona are expanding.
Inga Valinskienė joins the team of artists, who is entrusted with one of the most important roles of the work - the known woman will play Juliet's nanny.
Povilas Bear, who will take care of the artists singing, also became an important part of the team.
"I think love stories from Shakespeare have been created many and very beautiful, but Romeo and Juliet, apparently, will always remain a symbol of these stories and will be built on various scenes for a long time to come.
It will be interesting to become part of one of such productions", - says I. Valinskienė about the new test that has fallen on her shoulders.
Although a well-known woman is on stage, she has created a number of roles in various performances or musicals, she has never had a babysitter to play.
"The time to play Juliet has already passed, - I. Valinskienė smiles.
- I'd probably be happy to accept such an offer in my time."
It is true that the character of the babysitter is no less important in Shakespeare's drama, even considered the most important by some critics.
Nanny is not only a mediator, a helper - her way and tone of speaking, her feminine attitude towards feelings and the resulting solidarity with lovers gives the plot more and other colors.
Moreover, the babysitting is also important because she is one of only two women in the drama Romeo and Juliet.
"The gold character is not very close to my way and style, but sometimes it's only more interesting because of it.
To create a different character than he has himself - a part of a fun creative process.
So far I do not know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the interpretation of the director, - says I. Valinskienė and reveals that being Juliet's babysitter would probably do the same.
- I think the babysitter was listening to her heart.
That's what most women do.
That's probably what I would do."
The legendary Kęstutis Antanelis rock opera Love and Death in Verona is based on V. Shakespeare's famous drama Romeo and Juliet.
Real facts-based work tells the tragic ending love story of two young people - Romeo and Juliet.
The sad outcome of history is determined by the uncertain origin of the conflict between the families of young people - Monteki and Kapulete.
"All kinds of stories are possible at all times.
Parents who are opposed to the choice of children have always been and will be.
It is only today that solutions to such problems - more diverse - were asked if Romeo and Juliet's story could be repeated today, says future nanny I. Valinskienė.
- In the name of my children, I'd come to terms with a lot of people, including my daughter-in-law."
In the rock opera directed by actor and director Ramūnas Cicėnas, the main roles of Romeo and Juliet will be performed by Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justinas Jarutis.Vidas Bareikis, Kęstutis Cicėnas, Mindaugas Papinskis, Marius Jampolskis, Paulius Shinkūnas and Aidas Barkauskas will also appear on stage.
The latest production of the rock opera Love and Death in Verona will be presented to the audience in late December.
The first legendary piece to be heard in new colours will be seen on December 28 by the spectators of Vilnius Siemens Arena.
A day later, on December 29th, the rock opera will be shown at Klaipėda Švyturys Arena.

"Skamp" presents a song whose video has already been refused to be shown by one TV
This year and again, the band "Skamp" started to compose music intensively to celebrate its 20th anniversary.
After announcing the only anniversary concert "Skamp20" to take place on 26 December in Vilnius Siemens Arena, the famous trio presents new works one by one.
This time - it's "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" and a bold video of the song.
"This track is about love, so I thought that all types of relationships should be perpetuated in the video, regardless of age or sexual orientation," Erica Jennings reveals the idea of a new song and video, which is convinced that any manifestation of homophobia in 2018 is not normal.
The video of the new song "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" filmed over ten pairs of different orientations and ages: "We have always supported LGBTQIA communities and believe that one day we will no longer have to discuss it," says Viktor Diawara, who composed the music of the work at the beginning of the year during the family vacations in Israel.
It is true that this video "Skamp" has already received negative reactions - it was not wanted to be one of the most popular shows in the country.
This tells us a lot about our society.
Television will not show the video because people kiss in it and it is supposed to be inappropriate content for children.
And the fact that at any time of the day the TV can be set on the on-screen fights and other examples of violence is the right content?" - asks Mrs Jennings rhetorically.
Erices is also induced by Willius Alesius: "We would like to see more hands-on and kissing people around, regardless of their social status, gender or age.
We raise children, and we want them to grow up in an environment with as much tolerance and as little bullying as possible.
With the new song and video, we want to brighten up at least a little bit the day of our listeners and give them a smile."
The band "Skamp" has been known for bold lyrics in which they spoke unpopular or sensitive topics since 1998.
All the band's best songs - old and new - will sound loud and wide at the Skamp20 concert already on 26 December in Vilnius Siemens Arena.
It awaits everyone with their families, and for children under the age of 10, the entrance is free.
At the Clinic Viaduct - traffic accident: a person who has been hit by a bicycle
A few minutes after 9 a.m. the version of the portal kauno.diena.lt was reached by readers about police and ambulance crews driving towards Kaunas clinics.
The study revealed the reasons for this upheaval.
The Kaunas police watchman confirmed to the portal that there was a traffic accident at the Klinikų Viaduct at the intersection of Utena and Eivenių Street.
During her, a car and a cyclist collided.
According to the Kaunas Medical Ambulance spokeswoman, the person who was riding the bicycle was hit in the accident.
Happiness, major injuries avoided, and no open wounds were seen on the body.
The victim shall be subject to medical examination on the site of the disaster.
Drivers report that the accident may make this section of road more difficult to pass.
Presidential Palace: LRT is not the property of politicians
As the Seimas intends to return to the consideration of the conclusions of the commission which investigated the activities of the LRT, the Presidential Palace fears that those who rule are simply seeking to gain more political control over the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is not the property of politicians, and the essential principle is to maintain that independence from politicians," said Mindaugas Lingė, the President's adviser to News Radio.
However, highlighted by the counselor, the opposite process can be seen at this point.
"It can be seen that those (political. - ELTA) influences are wanted to have more.
This is what we are critical enough to say," Mr Linge said.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT Commission in the Seimas are questionable and questionable because it targets the independence of the broadcaster.
Although Mr Lingė stressed the need to improve LRT governance, this should be done on the basis of expert assistance and on the basis of specific aspects hampering the smooth functioning of LRT.
He stressed that already now international institutions are stressing that LRT activities should be supervised not by political authorities but by competent authorities.
On Tuesday, the Seimas intends to take a decision on the conclusions of the commission which investigated the activities of the LRT.
These conclusions received much criticism.
The proposals to change the governance of the LRT have been very sceptical about reducing the powers of the Council and linking the terms of office of its members to those of the appointing authorities.
In this context, the European Broadcasting Union expressed its concerns.
In January, the opposition group of the Seimas Members appealed to the Constitutional Court regarding the compatibility of the special parliamentary commission investigating the activities and finances of the LRT with the Constitution.
Working abroad - good news from R. Karbauskas
The Seimas began considering the amendment to the Law on Declaration of Place of Residence presented by the elder Ramūnas Karbauskas of the Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union faction, according to which citizens working and paying taxes outside Lithuania would be exempted from paying compulsory health insurance contributions.
Following the presentation of the draft, 56 Seimas Members supported the draft on Tuesday, before there were 9 and 25 MPs abstained.
After consideration in the committees, the draft shall be considered at the Seimas plenary sitting on 6 December. The Seimas also decided to request the Government’s conclusion.
According to the proposed project, the persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the states of the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation shall, by the decision of the administration agency of the State Social Insurance Fund, be exempted from the compulsory payment of health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania.
Residents and working outside Lithuania, according to the procedure established by the State Social Insurance Fund Board (Sodra) and the State Tax Inspectorate, would be deemed to have left Lithuania.
It's about services that a person doesn't use.
There are additional possibilities to record the fact that a person is away," Mr Karbauskas explained from the Seimas Tribune.
Such a proposed legal regulation, in the opinion of the Seimas Member Conservative Antanas Matulas, would be unfair to citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.
"Part of Lithuanians living abroad abuse this," Matulas remarked.
The Social Democrat, Algirdas Syss, believes that this is how we call on citizens to comply with their obligation.
In his view, it would make it possible for slicks to use the health care system for free.
The adoption of the proposed amendments to the law will ease the burden of administration of Sodra's debts for persons who move to other countries to live there, pay social security contributions there, do not accumulate debts.
Currently, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania but have not declared their departure in accordance with the procedure laid down by legal acts in the Residents’ Register are charged monthly compulsory health insurance (PSD) contributions, and if they are not paid, debt accumulates.
A. Breadela convicted of fraud but acquitted of counterfeiting
The Vilnius Regional Court left the sentence valid for attempting to cheat on convicted former famous sportsman Alvydas Breadėla, but he was acquitted of document fraud.
The verdict issued by the court on Monday came into effect immediately.
A. Duonėla has been sentenced to imprisonment for one and a half years, with a suspended sentence.
The multiple Lithuanian Canoe Rowing Champion was convicted this year by Vilnius City District Court.
He was given a sentence of two and a half years in jail.
The Vilnius Regional Court, which examined the case on the basis of the convict's complaint, removed one charge, but the sentence remained the same.
The former athlete will also have to pay nearly €760 to the Crime Victims Fund.
The prosecutor's office accused him of falsifying a bill in 2013 by which he lent 200 thousand litas (about 58 euros) to his dental office led by his now-former wife Dalia Burokaite.
The spouse only learned about this in December 2016, when she received calls to pay off the debt.
The former spouse said that she had never borrowed money from her husband and had not signed the bill.
According to the judges of Vilnius Regional Court, there is no objective data in the case proving that it was A. Duonėla who would have recorded the untrue data that it was supposed that UAB "Dalecija" owed A. Duonėla 200 thousand litas.
It agrees with the arguments set out in the complaint of the convict and his defender, there are no objective data confirming this in the case.
Having thus stated that A. Duonėla only used a false true document for deception and admitted that this attribute - the use of a false document - is an integral part of fraud (in the case under consideration - an attempt to commit fraud), A. Duonėla is acquitted in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code without proof that he was involved in the commission of a criminal act," the verdict of Vilnius Regional Court says.
Firefighters rescued cats buried in the ground - they heard the riveting for three days
According to the Kaunas County Fire Rescue Board, the announcement was received that for three days there was a cat buried after the heat pipes were changed.
Firefighters who arrived also heard the cat's riveting.
It was discovered that a few days ago thermal track repairs were carried out here.
It is assumed that when burying the track under the overlay could have been grounded two cats.
Firefighters unearthed a thermal track overlay located at a depth of one and a half feet (1.5 m) and knocked out a cavity in it for cats to come out.
Antonino Scalia's son claims that his father would not be surprised by the Liberal protests over Kavanaugh's
On Sunday, the son of the Supreme Court Judge Antonino Scalia said to Fox News that his father's unsurprised extremes protest against nominated Judge Brettas Kavanaugh because Scalia felt that the Supreme Court was too meddling in the affairs of the modern world.
"In general, he would not be very surprised by the noise of the nomination to the Supreme Court because many refer to the case of Roe v. Wade – at least that is what the left says," said Christopher Scalia, recalling the landmark 1973 case, after which the constitutional right of women to abortion is established during certain trimesters.
The Roe case one ypu abolished the rights of all states to regulate abortion themselves and some states immediately attempted to limit the right to abortion in response to this decision.
"My father often said that in Roe v Wade and other cases, the court did try to solve cultural problems even though they had to be resolved during the elections and the legislative process," he added during a show on Fox & Friends."
"By trying to speed up the proceedings, the Supreme Court has done even more harm, so nominations to the Supreme Court and disputes over approval cause a more intense reaction as judges take on a role that belongs to the legislators."
Nebraska Senator Republican Ben Sasse expressed a similar view at a hearing this month on Kavanaugh's approval, reiterating that Congress often gives too much power to executive authorities that are not fundamentally accountable to anyone, and leaves the resulting bureaucratic issues to the Supreme Court, so the judges must take the job that Senators refuse.
Capitol Hill police arrested and accused hundreds of protesters of illegally interfering in the candidate's approval process.
When asked if Kavanaugh could avoid a hostile reaction due to unconfirmed accusations of sexual misconduct, which he was supposed to have committed decades ago, Scalia said that he would likely not be able to avoid noise.
In response to statements that Kavanaugh should not hold office in the Supreme Court, as he reacted fervently and sometimes — presumptuously — during a questioning by Senators on Thursday, Scalia questioned whether all judges were in a calm character.
"Judges are often angry," said Scalia when talking about the angry disagreements that sometimes arise in controversial cases.
"In fact, Judge Kavanaugh probably reacted more aggressively, but these were different circumstances.
He tried to defend his good name from unconfirmed charges."
On Thursday, in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kavanaugh was allowed to take part in the entire Senate vote by a majority vote of the party (11 against 10).
Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake stated in a dramatic moment that he would give his decisive vote to Kavanaugh only if the FBI were given a week to investigate the current probable charges of misconduct brought against Kavanaugh.
The investigation is still ongoing and President Trump said that the agency has a broad mandate and can question "whatever it wants".
"Schiaparelli" in the ready-to-wear collection – fantastic attire
Is it possible to embody surrealism?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
The Paris Fashion House, founded almost a hundred years ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, presented her first ready-made clothing and handbag collection.
Fantastic rather than wearing ready-made clothes for a fond brand, this collection is almost as incredible as the famous Elsa Schiaparelli flip shoe-shaped cap.
This time fashion houses that have long cherished the eccentric image have also appeared as very modern.
In aesthetic decisions you will find emoticons, lobsters, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli created her first overall in 1930 and was the first designer whose models marched the podium by music.
She and her friend Salvador Daly came up with a combination of art and fashion, and now Calvin Klein and Raff Simmons, who collaborated with US artist Sterling Ruby, took over the idea.
Glider's legend is that Daly, co-created with Schiaparelli and embroidered with a lobster motif, wanted to smear the evening dress before the demonstration with a true mayonnaise, but did not get approval.

"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is inseparable from the history of Schiaparelli," said Bertrand Guyon, the creative director for the last three years, who was interviewed in the salon of the fashion house in Vandom Square.
In creating his ready-to-wear collection, he drew on Schiaparelli's friendship with Manu Ray and worked with the My Ray Foundation to create clothing based on well-known works of art.
A famous picture of the artist's closer eyes "Glass Tears" is shown on the T-shirts tucked with "Perspex" tears, and the red lip from "Observatory time: lovers" is pressed on a straight silhouette dress with collage by the method of silkscreen.
My Ray's "Glass Tears" on the collection's T-shirt
One of Elsa's oddities was her superstitious attraction to the letter S. Her brand colour – "Shocking Pink" inspired her perfume "Shocking".
The first "Schiaparelli" handbag, created by Guyono, with a key hole on the buckle is named "Mystery".
Its retail price will also be fantastic at £5,000.
Yesterday, a temporary store was opened in a warehouse on the left bank of Senna, where the surrealist side of Paris Fashion Week was shown and the carpets of Virgil Abloh from the soon to appear in the Ikea collection were available for €100.
Half an hour before the opening, more than 500 young fans of Abloh lined up on the pier, eager to buy one of his works at more favorable prices than his "Louis Vuitton" men's clothes.
For Ablohui, this project helps reach a wider audience than the one that has access to luxury fashion or designer-made furniture.
“No one has any property anymore, but knowledge of a particular chair can help to make a conversation at the dinner table.
That's what the millennial generation thinks," he recently said.
The audience gathered in the Marais district realized that this garage event would not be commonplace when models began to ride past them on skateboards.
The collection of free colorful male and female robes by Vivienna Westwood's husband designer Andreas Kronthaler was based on portraits of Jessica Fulford-Dobson Kabul skateboarders.
Some women (and a few men) wearing high - heel sandals drove on skateboards, but they were wearing intoxicating platform boots.
Westwood, who watched the performance in the first row and wearing a dress of the collection with horse motifs and an orange cardigan sewn over her waist, joined her husband for her last bowing on the podium, who gave her a bouquet of flowers.
Strong twin bond in pictures
Detroit-born and London-based Peter Zelewsky had already established himself as a street photographer when he began shooting twins four years ago.
"As a portrait photographer and a person, I have always been fascinated by the twins and their extraordinary connection, which everyone is talking about," he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, but according to him, "after taking a photograph of the portrait of the first twins, I became addicted and there was no way back".
Photos and stories of 44 identical twin pairs will be published in Zelewsky's book "The Twins" shortly to appear.
This project is more visual, he says: "This is not a documentary or a scientific project – I wanted to take a picture of people's impactful and sensual portraits."
Nurses expressed no confidence in the trade union that negotiated wages
Members of the Royal College of Nursing, dissatisfied with the trade union's deal with the National Health Service on salaries, expressed no confidence in the union after the vote and accused it of distorting demands for wage increases that were expected.
This unprecedented decision came after prolonged discussions at the Royal College of Nursing, when his former Secretary-General Janet Davies admitted that he had mistakenly promised members that their salaries would immediately increase by 3% this year, once the 1% pay cap was lifted.
Unawakened by the expected rise in salaries, members became angry and forced Davies to retire from office, then petitioned and held an emergency meeting in Birmingham on Friday, after which they expressed no confidence in the college council.
“A fair and open debate in Birmingham helped to clarify the relationship, so the college will only strengthen,” said Maria Trewern, Director of the Royal College of Nursing.
"The vote is clear and the board and management of the Royal College of Nursing understood the message sent to it.
The Council has already sought changes in the organisation in recent weeks and has tried to listen to the Members' words and involve them; we will continue our efforts to implement this."
The meeting will be held next week and council members of the Royal College of Nursing are expected to withdraw.
"The basis of care is trust," said the National Health Service nurse to the newspaper "Guardian".
"The actions of the Royal College of Nursing Council have ruined confidence in it and the council must therefore withdraw.
I hope she will do well and listen to the request.
I wonder if members of other trade unions will also seek reform."
In August, Rachel Harrison, state official of the General Trade Union at the National Health Service, said to the Guardian: "After receiving salaries, National Health Service employees from all over the country realized that they had not received the expected boost.
It angered them."
Prior to the unusual meeting, the Royal College of Nursing acknowledged that it had made mistakes in the 2018 salary negotiations and had been poorly informed about them.
However, it is also argued that the campaign by the Royal College of Nursing to lift the salary restriction forced the government to abandon this restriction and pledge to gradually increase salaries by 6.5% over a three-year period.
The vote followed an independent investigation, finding that the college tended to land in negotiations, and Davies was accused of underestimating the deal.
The Royal College of Nursing is said to have provided inconsistent information, so members could not make a reasonable decision on the deal and did not consider alternatives.
The college published conflicting information on whether all employees would receive a 3% salary increase.
A brief report before the college assembly erroneously stated to the representatives that "a 3% increase and an increase were planned in the course of the gradual implementation of the reform".
Indeed, salaries had to be gradually raised to 3%, and only some of the highest wage earners would have immediately received an increase.
"Almost all the information provided to members after the meeting about the implementation of the transaction was false (probably due to attempts to simplify it)," said a representative of the Electoral Reform Service, which conducted the investigation.
In the view of the ERS, the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction were not explained in a comprehensible and concise manner by the decision-makers, and the main advantages were not clearly identified, including the 6.5% and 29% calculations mentioned during the campaign, which made it impossible to make a reasonable decision.
The vote of censure was approved by 78% of the votes cast, and 3.74% of the members of the Royal College of Nursing took part in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan shocked the viewers of Instagram live streaming in an attempt to "abduct" children from the family
Lindsay Lohan received criticism for the direct broadcast of Instagram, during which she followed a homeless family on the street and tried to separate her sons from her parents.
In the beginning of live broadcasts, most likely filmed in Moscow (deciding according to Lohan's previously updated Instagram story), the actress offered to provide the family with a place of accommodation, but the situation quickly complicated.
“Hello for everyone! I want to show you what family I met,” she told the audience, “they are Syrian refugees, and I am very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me?
Come on, I'll take care of you," she told the family before turning to one of the children: "Would you like to stay at the hotel?
Look at the movies?
After all, it would be fun to watch a movie on TV or a computer."
When his parents refused, Lohan reacted hostilely.
“Your children should not be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
"If someone offers them a home and a place of accommodation, as I do now, you should agree.
They'll come back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't fuck with me."
When the family tried to move away from Lohan by walking down the street, the actress followed her by continuing to broadcast her live on Instagram.
“Look what’s going on is child trafficking, which is how you spoil Arab culture.
You marry kids even though they don't want to go with you.
Boys, don't worry, I'm with you and now the whole world sees us."
The broadcast ended in a physical confrontation – the mother appears to have struck Lohan.
Video clips spread on social media and some users became interested in whether this could not have been equated with attempted kidnapping.
The Independent contacted Lohan's representative for comments.
A third of the British believe that they will never pay off all their debts
Nearly a third of Britons believe that they will not be able to cover their debts during their lifetime, and one person in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study conducted by Equifax and Gorkana, the results of which were revealed only by The Independent, showed that the British, especially those in the 18-24 age group, believe that they will have debts throughout their lives, and only half of them expect to get out of them.
A report released last year by the Institute for Fiscal Research indicates that students who have completed their education remain in debt of around £46,000, while the poorest students remain in debt of over £57,000.
Most graduates (81 percent) will never pay off the full debt, so they will work under debt pressure for the first 30 years.
Public indebtedness is rising: According to the National Statistics Department, the debt of families in the United Kingdom is of record size and the British spend an average of £900 more annually than they earn.
But is it worth worrying about these fearsome statistics?
Is age-old debt simply a new way of life for young adults (and for society as a whole)?
One example is cars, which are the next major purchase to be purchased from a home (if such a success smiles).
Auto Trader this week predicted that within a decade all new cars will be purchased for hire – this will be the usual way of purchasing vehicles.
Jeannie Boyle, Director of EQ Investors and Certified Financial Planner, believes that expectations have changed.
"It is certainly normal to have debts these days: credit cards, interest-free refinancing, student loans and high-speed credits have become popular," she said.
"The generation of our grandparents was ashamed to have debts."
Today, student indebtedness and house prices have made debt a normal phenomenon.
This statement is also supported by Moira O'Neill, the head of the personal finance department of Interactive Investor, who believes that the results may be worrying.
"If you borrow a huge amount four or five times your income, it may seem that additional debts will not mean anything," she explained.
And so people get in trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so people with large loans or other debts need to think about what would happen if the rates went up."
It is unlikely that the commentators in the financial industry are in any doubt.
Brian Brodie, Managing Director of the loan agency Freedom Finance, says: "The debts are not taboo.
The loan for home repairs or a new car is no longer considered to be the last resort.
Due to low interest rates, many people have made savings on time deposits that generate higher returns, but not so easy to achieve the money saved.
As a result, the middle class is borrowing more and more.
Over the past six months, around half of the new loans have been taken by customers with excellent creditworthiness assessments."
Richard Haymes, the head of the financial problem solving department of TDX Group, believes that such expectations – not to get out of debt for the rest of his life – are really worrying.
He says: “In August, inflation peaked at six months (2.7 percent), interest rates rose, and earnings rose modestly, so the decision of many people to borrow without a realistic plan to pay off their debts is worrying.
Our analysis has shown that the number of personal bankruptcies will rise by 17 percent this year, and the main determining factor is the record consumer borrowing."
Debts may not cause much anxiety while a person is working and earning, but it is unclear how lifelong arrears will affect his or her well - being in old age.
A study of the Centre for Economic and Business Research, carried out in conjunction with funds lending specialists from More 2 Life, showed that over the last four years people's unsecured debts have increased by more than a third, i.e. more than twice as fast as the national average.
This age group mostly borrows through credit cards and spends 30 percent more each month than it earns.
Boyle added: “A growing number of people at the age of 55 choose to pay their debts from pension funds, which will affect their retirement lives.
In most cases, these are the only savings they "must" save.
In addition, people think that using the wealth will pay off later, but the exchange of the property to cheaper one does not get as much money as expected.
If property prices fall, this situation will only get worse."
With her naked side, Serena Williams sang "I Touch Myself" to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams released a video in which she sings the classic "Divinyls" song "I Touch Myself" under her hands covering her naked breast.
Tennis Assay shared the video on their Instagram page and explained that she created the video to encourage women to check their breasts.
"In this month of fighting breast cancer, I recorded a version of The Divinels' world hit I Touch Myself in order to remind women to check themselves regularly," wrote Williams.
“This is how I left my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because this problem affects women of all races around the world.
The key to early detection is to save many lives.
I hope I can remind women of that."
Williams continued: "This music video is part of the I Touch Myself Project, which is implemented in honor of the famous Chrissy Amphlett – she died of breast cancer and gave us her hit to remind women to take care of their health first."
The project, supported by the underwear brand Berlei for Break Cancer Network Australia (BCNA), started in 2014 after the death of 53-year-old Amphlett.
The video, published by the tennis star on his Instagram account, received more than 1.5 million views and many praises from fans for how the tennis player sang the song.
“The warmest wishes for this video and your courage to do so.
Thank you, Serena," wrote one fan.
Another added: “Serena, it’S NOT.
Twenty years ago, I had breast cancer and detected the nodule myself, even when the mammograms showed nothing.
You just have to check it out.
Thank you for not being afraid to leave the comfort zone – you're a real goddess!"
Berlei's project I Touch Myself Project also released a new snake skin pattern bra, The Chrissy, inspired by a rock star.
100 percent of the profits from the sale of the bra will be donated to the BCNA.
It is important to know for yourself what signs and symptoms you should look for.
Signs of breast cancer include not only nodules but also changes in the size or shape of the breast, rashes or wounds, discharge from the nipples, skin surface pitting, persistent pain or changes in the texture of the skin.
In addition, swelling at the axillary or keybone, swollen vein, and recessed nipple may be a warning for cancer.
Women are recommended to have a monthly breast examination.
If you notice any signs of breast cancer, NHS recommends that you contact your family doctor immediately.
If your family doctor considers that your symptoms need further evaluation, he will send you to the breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driver forced the entire SNL filming group to quatotis
Adam Driver was this week's Saturday Night Live guest star and actually tried to make everyone laugh.
The best jokes of the show are usually not related to a particular topical event – as is a new parody titled "Career Day".
The U.S. High School Day is portrayed when students bring their dads, and teenager Mortdecai (Pete Davidson) reluctantly agrees that his father, old oil magnate Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driver), would give a speech.
Parnassus, whose megalomanic personality could have been inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis's character Daniel Plainview from the film “Bus blood”, vividly tells how he took over the oil industry.
"I got born seven months too early," says Parnassus to students.
“Incubator technology had just been invented, so I was put in a cast iron pot and heated in a pizza oven until I learned to walk.
My bones never hardened, but not my spirit!
Be strong and crush your enemies!"
Davidson and his fellow SNL actress Aidy Bryant, who plays the teacher, almost hold out without laughing and can't look Driver in the eye.
However, the jokes of the "Star Wars" actor only get under way and he begins to tell about a personal war with another oil magnate, H. R. Pickins.
"I married your granddaughter!" he smells like
"I filled her belly with my pussing seed and ruined your boy – it's my ultimate revenge, H. R.!"
Parnassus became the same memorable character of Adam Driver in less than five minutes as Kyle Ren of the two films.
"Be damned, H. R.!"
Leaked songs by Kendrick Lamar: Eight unheard of tracks appeared online
A number of unreleased songs by Kendrick Lamar appear to have been leaked.
On Saturday, eight still unheard-of works spread online, with lots sung by SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Abby Soul.
It is unclear where the songs came from, and the title of the collection "Bad Kid Chill City EP" and the cover illustration (probably created by the fan) are not official.
It is possible that only demonstration and incomplete versions of the songs are leaked, sounding as if they were recorded at different stages of Lamar's career.
Gang Remember could belong to the Good Kid Maad City era, while Heroin, sung together with SZA, is more like the soundtrack DAMN./Black Panther.
The following songs are distributed in the set:
Gang Remember;
The Only Nigga;
"Want In Life";
Loved Ones (with SZA);
Own This City;
'Heroin (with SZA, Jay'umi Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Ab Soul)';
Look Over Your Shoulders (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
"Swimming Pools Alternate".
The Independent contacted Kendrick Lamar's representative for a comment.
Confusion due to the musical "Chicago": there are no tickets left in Klaipeda, invites you to go to Vilnius or Kaunas
The Lithuanian wish to see the musical "Chicago" of Klaipėda State Musical Theatre - does not subside.
For this reason, perhaps the most popular Lithuanian musical of all time set out on another tour through the country's largest arenas.
However, about 1.5 months before the shows, the halls begin to lack space.
The organizers announce that all tickets to the musical at Klaipėda Švyturys Arena have already been sold, and tickets to performances at Kaunas Žalgiris and Vilnius Siemens Arenas are rapidly melting.
There are no tickets in the port city for some time, so we invite everyone who wants to see this indifferent non-leaving musical to go to Kaunas or Vilnius, where there are some more tickets.
The performances will take place in December, so when you arrive from further away, not only will you see our musical, but you will also have a great opportunity to see the Christmas trees of the biggest cities in the country," Laima Vilimienė, the Head of Klaipėda State Theatre, offers a solution to the fans of the musical.
In December the audience of "Chicago" will be greeted with a slightly changed composition of the artists.
One of the musical's main roles is first entrusted to actor Tom Jaib.
The talented and well-known actor from TV screens in Chicago will embody the inimitable Billy Flynn - Chicago's best and most influential lawyer, without scruples changing people's fates.
Since the musical "Chicago" of Klaipėda State Musical Theatre is adapted for larger spaces, arenas, the set of artists appearing in it is also larger than the work shown on Broadway.
Almost half a hundred artists appear in Lithuanian "Chicago".
The main roles of women are entrusted to the charming soloist Beata Ignatavičiūtė of Klaipėda State Musical Theatre (killer Velma Kelly) and the charismatic soloist of Kaunas Musical Theatre Gabriele Bielskyte (killer Roxie Hart).
The musical "Chicago" depicts Chicago's criminal world of the 1920s, which turns the prison walls into a stellar hill.
It is a musical satire of criminal justice, telling of two murderers seeking attention and recognition.
The musical is pervaded by sexuality and irony.
No matter where and whatever the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - the meaning of life - to shine a shining star.
Their life is life because of the message on the front page, because of the title, the glitter, the Hall of Fame...
On the 13th of December, Chicago will be shown at Klaipėda Švyturys Arena, on the 18th of December - at Kaunas Žalgiris Arena, on the 20th of December - at Vilnius Siemens Arena.
Tickets are distributed by Tiketa.
Living room furniture in Kaunas
The site can be called a representative area of the house, where we spend time with friends, receive guests, etc. Therefore, it should be arranged in such a way as to be convenient not only for the owners of the apartment or house, but also for the guests.
Depending on the size of the living room, walls, ceiling decoration, and the taste of the hosts, you should choose the appropriate furniture.
The site should not only be beautiful, but also comfortable.
It is best to invite an interior designer to help you fill the space optimally, so that it is not overloaded or vice versa - too empty.
It is advised to first determine the main point of the site, i.e. the object to which you will combine furniture, other details.
It may be a fireplace or other important interior highlight of the site.
It would also be great to create a chat space where guests can communicate comfortably, so that they will not be disturbed by outside furniture, etc.
Sofas, chairs should be placed close to each other so that your guests can sit down and talk.
So the arrangement of furniture must encourage communication, unite people, not distance them from each other.
Do not push furniture against the wall.
The size of the room depends on the distance from the walls.
Even though the room is small, still leave at least a little space from the wall, do not push the furniture close to it.
If the space in the room is large, leave even more space from the walls.
In fact, the greater the distance, the better.
Build a balance by placing the furniture
Consider the various details that will be on your site. size and location.
All elements must be compatible with each other.
Living room furniture must be compatible with interior details.
A slight contrast is possible.
It will invigorate the interior of the site, but it should not be too large as the interior will become tasteless.
We advise you to always consult with interior designers.
By creating the interior of the site yourself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you risk to deviate to extremes: either you will create a boring interior, because you will be afraid to experiment, mistake, make inappropriate choices or overdo improvisation.
Proper lighting
This is a very important thing.
After all, different light reveals space in different ways.
Lighting must be arranged at various levels: ceiling lighting, wall lighting, floor standing lighting.
The Prosecution Service appealed the acquittal against the heads of the LCF
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office appealed the acquittal of the Vilnius Regional Court against former heads of the Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF).
As the prosecutor's office reported on Monday, the complaint indicated that Panevėžys City Municipality had no legal basis to contribute money from the municipal budget to the reconstruction of a private hotel in Panevėžys.
In the course of the pre-trial investigation, it was established that in order to find a possibility to finance the reconstruction of the hotel, in 2010 a service procurement and sale agreement was concluded between the Lithuanian Basketball Federation and Panevėžys City Municipality.
Prosecutors state that the Federation had not intended and could not provide the services that it was supposed to provide to Panevėžys City Municipality under the said contract, because the planned services had already been received or planned to be provided by the State and sponsors funding, some of the planned events had already taken place before the signing of the contract and had already been paid out of other funds, and some of the events had already taken place after the VAT invoicing - money was transferred by invoices for the events that had not yet taken place.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office states that it disagrees with the conclusion highlighted in the judgment of the Court of First Instance that the State itself ordered and commissioned the Panevėžys City Municipality to undertake the reconstruction of a private hotel, since no state obligation for a particular hotel existed, only the suggestion was expressed to the Panevėžys City Municipality to resolve the issues of hotel development required for the championship as soon as possible.
In the opinion of the prosecutor's office, the court found that the heads of the municipality of LKF and Panevėžys tried to fulfil the state's obligation without having legal roads, because the data in the case showed that there was a possibility to hold the European Basketball Championship group competitions in other cities without violating the law.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office shall, by appeal, request that the court of first instance annul the acquittal judgment and adopt in this case a new - a conviction - sentence on seven natural persons and one legal person.
On October 15, the Vilnius Regional Court completely acquitted Mindaugas Balčiūnas, the Secretary General of the LKF, of all the alleged crimes.
This case concerns preparations for the European Basketball Championship for Men in Lithuania in 2011.
Balčiūnas was indicted for abuses, fraud and other crimes.
The prosecutor's office accused Balčiūnas of agreeing with the chief financier and executive director of the Federation in his capacity as secretary-general of the LKF that in the name of the Federation false acts of execution of works - transfer and other false financial documents included in the official accounts as well as accounts about the services provided to the municipality of Panevėžys by the LKF should be drawn up.
According to the pre-trial investigation carried out by the officers of the Special Investigation Service (STT) Panevėžys Board, the funds of Panevėžys City Municipality could be fraudulently and faked in favour of the LCF and later used for reconstruction of the Hotel Romantic of Via Unica.
The head of this hotel Dalia Kuklierienė has been accused of bribery - it is suspected that she gave television as a bribe to Balčiūnas.
All those convicted with Balčiūnas have been acquitted.
The indictments in this case were submitted to eight natural persons and one legal person - the Lithuanian Basketball Federation.
Remote workplace - like the Bermuda Triangle
In Lithuania, the number of people injured or killed at work from 1992 until now has already exceeded the total population of Alytus city and amounts to about 83 thousand.
If the requirements for a particular physical workplace and its security are as if clear as possible, then a kind of new Bermuda triangle becomes a choice to work remotely - from homes, public spaces or even other countries.
According to insurance professionals, although the Law on Safety and Health at Work provides for the provision of safety and health conditions that are not different for teleworking workers from other employees of the company, the variety of modern forms of work may give rise to a number of questions, says the press release.
In the event of an accident at home, the employer pays 80% of the compensation for the first two days of unemployment and Sodra for the rest of the period.
If an accident is found to have occurred during work, Sodra shall reimburse 100% of the salary from the first day of incapacity for work.
When assessing the statistics provided by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage administered by the BTA, it is evident that the absolute majority of accidents and various injuries occur at the workplace.
Most of the time, these are various physical activities, where the risk of injury is higher: reckless handling of devices or equipment, loss of concentration or coordination.
However, the offices, where most of the most demanded, best paid professionals are now concentrated, are faced with their own challenges, which are created by the employers and the freedom of mobility enjoyed by the employees," says Evgenija Krikščiūnė, Head of Human Resources Management Division of the BTA.
The legal acts in force in Lithuania recommend to clearly regulate the employee's duties and limits of liability, define working time, location and functions, which also applies to the formation of work at a distance.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred during work or not.
There are certainly different situations and nuances, and each case is dealt with individually.
Employees have often heard of the fact that, for example, the employer is responsible for accidents occurring when travelling to or from work or when travelling to work.
However, there are a lot of nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both employees and employers to initiate interviews, to find out and state in maximum clarity and in a mutually acceptable manner what situations are actually considered to be accidents at work, and which will already have the status of domestic injuries," the specialist advises.
J. Krikščiūnė says that nowadays, when computer and mobile phone and stable internet communications are often sufficient to perform the functions of work, the employee will not necessarily work at the place and time specified in the agreement.
Workers are mobile, and they can choose to work that day, not at home, but by drinking coffee in a café or park while enjoying the sun.
It's gonna be a workplace, isn't it?
What if the working hours discussed are not in line with the agreement?
There may be really mixed situations, the circumstances of which can be explained by an ongoing investigation initiated by "Sodra" or State Labour Inspectorate," says the specialist.
In financial terms, the main difference between an event at work and an accident at home is the amount of the incapacity benefit.
J. Krikščiūnė admits that I had unofficially heard unpleasant experiences when employers try to cover up the real circumstances of accidents or injuries and try to persuade the employees to approach the doctors outside of work, take responsibility for themselves, thus suffering financially.
This is an unfair, disrespectful view of the worker and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the already mentioned mobility of people encourages the search for additional instruments that could help companies in similar situations: employer's civil liability insurance for damage to employees, acquisition of injury insurance, disability insurance or even death insurance, as well as health insurance is also relevant," says J. Krikščiūnė.
Mobile signature system running again
After the breakdown was eliminated in Lithuania on Monday, the mobile signature system was again operational, BNS was approved by the representatives of the Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions, the service provider.
This company reported the disruptions on Monday morning, with inconveniences experienced by the companies Bitė, Telia customers and some Tele2 users.
The disruptions were also recorded in Estonia, but representatives of SK ID Solutions could not comment on the situation in that country.
Polish lessons for the Lithuanian national rugby team
The Lithuanian national rugby team, which debuts in the European Trophy division, is still struggling to level up to the top level.
The Trophy Division in the Old Continent is the third-best after the Six Nations Tournament and the European Championship.
Teams from the continent with a 13-18 ranking compete here.
The competition started in October with a solid victory in Šiauliai at 30:10 against the Czech team.
Last weekend, the Lithuanian national team visited Łódź, where it did not qualify for the Polish national team - 0:33 (0:12).
Although the Lithuanians defended themselves self-sacrificely, they often violated the rules in the struggles and the Polish rugbymen broke forward with penalty strokes.
In the 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes, the penalty strikes were realized by Wojciech Piotrowicz, giving his own people a 12-point leverage.
In the first quarter of 10 minutes Lithuanians had to play without a yellow card from Tautvydas Mažylis.
In the second quarter, the guests staged several attacks, but failed to finish them effectively.
At the time, the Poles managed to break through the defences of ours.
Mateusz Plichta, later Krystian Pogorzelski and Mateusz Adamski, performed the ball's clamping in the scoring area.
In addition to several important rugby players, the coach of the Lithuanian national team from PAR Ntand Manyosha acknowledged the superiority of the contestants and said that such matches provided a lot of valuable experience.
"Polish played very well and dominated all the components of the game.
Our goal was to stand up to this game as long as possible.
We have just risen to this higher level and we have to get used to it.
We won the first game against the Czechs, but now we met very powerful rivals and we had to recognize their superiority.
The Polish national team has provided us with useful lessons," said a specialist from the PAR, who has been standing at the helm of the Lithuanian national team for four years.
Lithuanians will play their next game in Trophy on April 6, 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanians.
Dutch and Swiss teams still compete in this division.
Joseph Blažiunas became adviser to the Minister of Culture

J. Blažiunas will advise the Minister on archives, libraries, museums and management of cultural heritage.
J. Blažiūnas, who obtained his PhD in Art Sciences from Vilnius Academy of Arts, was the director of the Lithuanian Literary and Art Archive and associate professor of the Department of Muzeology at the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University.
According to the report, the Minister's adviser is the author of many scientific papers on cultural heritage and preservation of values.
Japan’s Coast Guard is looking intensely for a missing island
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given in 2014 to a whole tiny island in the north of Japan.
A small, meaningless, and valueless island, which was fundamentally unfit for life, was of great importance to Japan.
So important is that the area that is now missing is under intensive exploration - will it still be there?
Why does Japan need this island so much?
It won't happen.
It is likely that ice and underwater landslides have covered this island once and for all, although it has been protruding almost two metres above the surface of the water until recently.
There is little doubt that the island has simply broken, but at least its traces are expected to be found.
When the island disappeared no one knows exactly - it was so useless that no one cared too much for it.
Probably the first Japanese fishermen to learn about the disappearance of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima, who sometimes used the island as an aid to visual navigation.
Its disappearance, even for these fishermen, is not a tragedy, because there are better ways of finding out where fishing is possible and where the disputed Russian waters begin.
That is exactly what Esanbe Hanakita Kojima meant.
This narrow strip of land was the western edge of the Kuril archipelago itself.
This chain of islands, which Russia calls the Kuril Islands, and Japan the Northern Territories.
The conflict with some interruptions has continued since the middle of the 19th century, but full force has rocked in the 20th century.
These areas contain natural resources, but also historically Japan believes that the islands should belong to it.
The thing is, the Japanese have been exploring these islands since the middle of the 17th century.
They were the first to map, undertake more detailed research, registering numerous small islets.
The agreements signed between Japan and Russia in 1855 indicated that Sakhalin was going to the latter, and that Japan was going to all the Kuril Islands.
Thus these two states lived together until 1905, when the Russian Empire lost Sachalina to Japan in the war.
In 1945, the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened the Kuril Islands.
Japan, by the way, does not mean a large claim to the entire archipelago, although it was the first, but would like to have four islands - Iturup, Kunashi, Shikotan Islands and Chabomai.
Japan feels that it has a historical right, as the islands were explored first, and they also belonged to Japan under the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan offered Russia to share these four islands equally, but Russia did not even consider accepting such an offer.
Japan is quite close to the Northern Territories, but now that the island has disappeared, this geographical link is like lost.
That physical marker about Japan's presence in those waters disappeared.
This is a great loss, and the island's remnants are being searched for.
Even if they are found, however, Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not meet the simple definition of the island - it must be land.
This means a slight reduction in the territory of Japan and a significant reduction in the Exclusive Economic Zone, calculated off the coast.
I'm just wondering what the island's search mission is hoping for - after all, it won't be lost or washed away.
Unbelievable drama in the duel of the Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams
For more than a week I had to wait for the final verdict of the judges who became the winners of the cross-border meeting between the Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian duels were held in Poland.
Four encounters were won by Lithuanians, as well as Poles.
And the outcome of the decisive duel was determined by the long-running panel discussions and the final decision of the competition secretariat.
The meeting of the national teams began with the victories of the Lithuanian boxers.
Multiple Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weight category up to 52 kg) confidently defeated Jakub Surma 3–0; soon Edgaras Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) defeated Radomiras Obrušniakas after a persistent fight 2:1.
Two host wins followed: Damian Durkacz (up to 64 kg) defeated Manta Dužin by 3:0 and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) by 2:1 surpassed Simon Bani.
Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) restored the leverage for the Lithuanian national team.
Lithuanian defeated Bartosz Golebiewski in 2:1.
In the next fight, Piotr Szczukowkis (up to 81 kg) beat Eigir Kasmochi by a clear margin in the third round and the score was again equal to 3:3.
The Yocules brothers fared differently.
Robert Jokul (up to 91 kg) defeated Andrzei Colton by 3:0 and Arvydas Jokulius (over 91 kg) already had to recognize Adam Kulik's advantage in the first round.
The fight between Tado Tamašauskas (up to 91 kg) and Michal Soczynski caused the most debate.
It was thanks to its cross-border meeting that the announcement of the final result took more than a week.
One judge awarded the victory to the Pole, two judges to the Lithuanian, but due to a technical error the point awarded to one judge to the Lithuanian was credited to M. Soczynski.
After a long-running controversy, the victory is left to the Polish boxer - 2:1.
At the meeting of the Lithuanian and Polish national teams, the victory was won by the hosts by a score of 10:8 (two points are awarded for the victory).
They managed to retaliate for the crushing defeat suffered by the Lithuanians in the last match between them.
At the 2015 meeting in Marijampolė, Lithuanian boxers won as many as five fights out of six and won the victory with a score of 10:2.
For the leaders of the Lithuanian national team, the meeting in Poland was a general rehearsal against the Lithuanian Boxing Championship in Šilutė on 14-17 November.
After the priorities of the country, a new Lithuanian boxing team will be formed to defend the country's honour at the World and European Championships next year.
How does a dog by footprint determine in which direction a man went?
You already know the dog's sense of smell is extremely sensitive.
They can smell hidden explosives, drugs, blood, and other animals, and some even recognize diseases by smell.
Well known and made famous in the movies are trailing dogs, but their work is much harder than you thought.
How do they determine which direction the owner of the trace went in?
Indeed, this issue is much more complex than you think.
Trace tracking consists of three stages - finding, tracking and tracking.
The second stage is considerably heavier than the other two, as it is difficult to decide in which direction a man stepped when he approaches the trails.
After all, there isn't a second between the different steps, so their smell doesn't differ much, does it?
Not exactly like that.
As early as 1990, a study published by the University of Oslo described experiments that led the dog to a 90 - degree angle to the trajectory by which the person passed.
Tests were carried out on grass and asphalt.
And in many cases, dogs easily set the direction of a man's move, even when he tried to mislead them by passing the backwards.
Can you imagine how difficult this task is?
The difference between the odour of the adjacent trace is very small and is further reduced with time.
But scientists say it's not so strange - dogs could tell and which part of the foot touched the ground first.
This is because their sense of smell is an incredible tool.
The dog’s brain is dominated by areas responsible for smell (as our brain is dominated by regions responsible for vision).
The noses of dogs have 125 to 300 million odor receptors.
In general, the olfactory of dogs is at least 40 times more sensitive than that of humans, but their ability to interpret different odors plays an even greater role.
Scientists then conducted analogous experiments and with traces left by bicycles, but it was much more difficult for dogs to trace their direction.
This is because the cancers of the bike are not segmented as trails of a passing person, making it harder to isolate different places for comparison - it is not natural for dogs, so it takes more time.
True, dogs are not the owners of the strongest sense of smell.
This title would most likely go to the Bears.
Males of white bears follow ready for mating for hundreds of miles, and brown bears smell the stifled animal as far as 30 km away.
In private forests, promises to regulate fellings
Environment Minister Kęstutis Navickas will explain deforestation in the Seimas on Tuesday.
In late August, public dissatisfaction arose over forests felling in Labanor Regional Park.
The felling of these forests was halted for a month.
The minister has acknowledged that investigations into the fellings in Labanore have shown that there have been no gross violations.
However, the Ministry of Environment has already introduced some of the restrictions, taking into account the proposal of the working group to tighten deforestation in state-owned forests.
The Minister promises that further legislation to correct deforestation will be in place by the end of the year.
The same restrictions are intended to apply to fellings in state forests and private forest holdings.
Agnė Jagelavičiūtė unveils the strategy of bringing together 170,000 followers
People need to be given what they want and put what they want together, says Agnė Jagelavičiūtė on the LRT TV show Cultured with Nomeda.
According to the stylist, so she gradually gathered a huge crowd of fans.
"At first you flatter a person's taste, drag to yourself, and gradually over time you improve that taste," says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170,000 followers in her feisbuk account - she achieved such a number using a certain strategy: "At first you flatter a person's taste, drag to yourself, over time you gradually improve that taste".
Stylist A. Jagelavičiūtė says she hates uncertainty, so she shows her face as it is - authenticity and the ability to find the best way of presenting is the most important criteria for popularity in social networks.
She observes that there is no longer any human culture left on social media, because many internats come to them in order to get angry with someone or read the comments of other bickering people: "For example, in adolescence, there was a time when I wanted to bang with everyone and curse - now I no longer have that desire".
"Fake life is the scariest thing.
And on social media, there's a lot of that.
Feisbuk is even less than an instagram," she speaks.
A. Jagelavičiūtė, who has an education in interior design and painting, says that she sends a specific message on social networks - she talks about women's emancipation.
She also advertises the production produced by magazines, and sees creation in her work as well.
"I can't claim that fashion magazine is an expression of pure art, but I know there's really a lot of it there.
I believe there's a lot of creation in my work, just like vanity.
I'm balancing - that's my key to those huge numbers.
I don't want to make a fake life.
It is far better to give people what they want and quietly insert what they want," says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the hardest events to attract young people is classical music concerts.
Their popularity was increased by well-known people who suggested through life stories: talking about behind the scenes, failures, and life-like experiences while remaining authentic.
It is this strategy that A. Jagelevičiūtė proposes to apply to the whole culture.
According to her, culture does not have the potential to do so by flattering anyone, by doing no entertainment, and by displaying true values.
"Like a boring lecturer against students - is there a chance?
If we do not find a particular way to present that art, advertise without advertising, nothing will come out anyway.
When we're real and we catch the reader - maybe then something's going to change.
You will catch once, the second, the third - and already an addiction," she shares her insights.
Three people disappeared as the helicopter fell in Lituya Bay north of June
A three-man search was launched in Alaska on Saturday after a helicopter crash north of June.
One man was rescued after Friday's crash, and the other three failed to be found.
The helicopter crashed near Lituya Bay, northwest of June.
It was found that this was Airbus H125 on a long trip to Grand Prery in Texas.
The wreckage of the aircraft was detected 100 feet from the coast on Friday.
According to the Associated Press, one person saved was 14 years old.
She was reported to have had mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
Two adults and two teenagers flew in the fallen helicopter.
According to KTVA, David King (53), Josh Pepperd (42), and Andrew Pepperd (11) disappeared.
The senior Pepperd was found to be the director of the Alaskan construction company Davis Constructors & Engineers.
It is unclear what caused the accident.
The National Transportation Security Council has stated that an investigation has been launched.
"Two adults and two teenagers were flying in a crash helicopter that was completely new – just received from the factory," says a report from Coast Guard officers, based on KTVA.
The pilot was found to have 40 years of experience flying fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, including flights in Alaska.
According to Anchorage Daily News, family friend Jeff Brodsky said that loved ones "have not yet lost hope of a miracle".
With the help of a Coast Guard helicopter, rescuers resumed their search for experienced climbers missing on Mount Nevis in Fort William, Scotland on 17 February 2016.
Three people missing from the helicopter crash were searched in Alaska on Saturday.
"I have experienced sexual violence"
Presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway revealed the sexual violence suffered on Sunday morning.
Conway commented on the fierce controversy between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh, who is a candidate for the Supreme Court, and his accuser Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
Conway excitedly revealed that he had himself suffered sexual violence, and defended Kavanaugh against host Jake Tapper by claiming that the judge had been charged with sexual abuse by ignoring the facts unfavorable to the charges.
"I have great sympathy for the victims of sexual abuse and violence.
I myself have been subjected to sexual abuse," Conway said in CNN's Sunday show State of the Union.
"I am a victim of sexual violence and I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh, Take Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible.
We must be responsible for our own behaviour."
Conway said that the news network must be ashamed of Kavanaugh's comparison with Bill Cosby, who last week was sentenced to three to ten years in a Pennsylvania state prison.
Conway also criticized the Senate Judiciary Committee as it was unable to remove former President Bill Clinton, who engaged in oral sex in his office and lied to the people of the United States.
The survey showed that Kavanaugh and Ford's testimony divided the U.S. public
The Americans disagree over the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford – the accuser claims that the judge sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers.
The number of those who think Ford or Kavanaugh are lying is almost identical: 38 percent of those polled say that Kavanaugh most likely or certainly lied in giving testimony, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Judiciary Committee heard both parties when Ford sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein with detailed charges against the judge.
After the letter was made public, both Ford and Kavanaugh said they were ready to speak out against the committee.
In giving evidence, Ford claimed to be 100 percent sure that she was being attacked by Kavanaugh, not another person, at a party in the early 1980s.
In an emotional opening speech, a 51-year-old woman said she felt civic duty, so she could not remain silent.
"I am very scared," she said.
"I am here because I think it's my civic duty to tell me what happened to me when Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school."
Kavanaugh, who denied the sexual abuse charges of Ford and two other women, said that "never sexually assaulted anyone in high school, college, or ever later".
“Everybody tried their best to find something that would prevent me from voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic or disgusting it is,” he said.
"It's a mere libel at the last minute."
On September 27-28, the results of the poll conducted by YouGov, in which 2607 people were interviewed, were not surprisingly different: Democratic supporters believed more in Ford (73 percent) and Republicans believed in Kavanaugh (74 percent), although Ford's testimony was believed by more Republicans than Kavanaugh's – Democrats (14 percent compared to 11 percent).
The founder of "Body Worlds" exhibition, called "Doctor Death", wants to be cut and showcased in his own exhibition
The German scientist who invented plasticisation wants to become an eternal part of his exhibition "Body Worlds".
Gunther von Hagens came up with an innovative method that provides an opportunity to showcase corpses, skulls and organs in a world-round exhibition that received both admiration and controversy.
A 73-year-old man with cancer instructed his wife to plasticize him after his death to become a permanent exhibit at the exhibition Body Worlds, which will be opened in London this week.
“It will, in a sense, be the completion of his life’s work.
Now I understand that I will have to do it because that is how I will express my recognition and love," Angelina Whalley told The Observer newspaper.
She claimed that the man had given strict instructions on what to do with his corpse, and the entire process would take about a year.
Muscles, nerves and arteries should be unrolled and silicone injected into the body and placed in the correct position.
"He said to me: "Angelina, you can freeze me for a year to -25 degrees Celsius, but then you'll have to add your hands, otherwise I'll freeze."
So I'll be able to mourn for a year, then I'll have to take it."
He will then join the exhibition in the London Pavilion next to other bodies stagnant in time in upright postures, such as riding a horse or playing cards, by wearing a soft fetrine hat inherent in his image.
Von Hagens became famous in the UK for performing an autopsy on a live British television broadcast (which was the first public autopsy in 170 years).
More than 47 million people have visited Body Worlds exhibitions around the world since 1995.
The founder of Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernal, said to The Guardian that 100 percent of the exhibits of the exhibition, covering about 28,000 square feet, were donated by people who "gave their consent because they wanted to help the living, educate them and help them see possible problems".
“We see and read so many terrible things that we are terrified of death.
No one will escape it, death is common to all of us and I think that the Body Worlds show that there is no need to be afraid," said Tabernalis.
Ronald's lawyers threaten court action on rape charges
Advocates of Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo said on Friday that the German magazine, which printed "obviously illegal" American claims that Ronaldo raped her in 2009, will sue.
One of Ronald's lawyers, Christian Schertz, said in a statement that the article in Der Spiegel was an "unacceptable statement of private charges" and he would seek the magazine's remuneration to his client by legal means.
A statement was sent to Reuters by Ronaldo's representative, Gestiphute, in response to a request to comment on a Der Spiegel article published on the Internet on Friday.
Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the content of the declaration of Der Spiegel, which Reuters could not independently verify.
"Der Spiegel" first announced the charges in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world Ronaldo won the title of the best player in the world five times.
This summer he moved to Italian Juventus from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment on Der Spiegel's statement.
The magazine announces that the alleged rape took place in June 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas, as stated by Leslie Mark Stovall, attorney for Kathryna Mayorga, who had filed the charges.
Stovall told the magazine that Ronaldo and Mayorga had agreed out of court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality agreement for the $375,000 paid by Ronaldo.
Stovall did not immediately reply to Reuters' e-mails for comments, and Mayorga did not respond to home phone calls.
However, Stovall told Der Spiegel magazine that he had filed a civil complaint with a view to annuling the confidentiality agreement.
Mayorga told Der Spiegel magazine that she no longer bound her contract because she still feels the consequences of the night nine years ago.
"I survived serious crises," she said to Der Spiegel.
"And yet, the charge of rape.
I blame him and blame myself for signing this."
Sustainable business, ensuring the independence of creators
Are you ready to try Self-Publicing 3.0?
The new White Paper, published today by the Union of Independent Developers on the #selfpub3.0 website, for the first time explained in detail how to join other business creators, become independent and start a sustainable creative business.
Orna Ross, the founder of the Union of Independent Developers, has not been recognized for the first time as one of the 100 most influential people in publishing, will explain at the Digital Book World 2018 conference why creators should publish Self-Publicing 3.0 methods.
"Consumer trends, such as the increasing popularity of personal brands, responsible consumption and reading on mobile phones, together with digital publishing technologies create particularly favourable conditions for the business of creators," Ross says.
However, these opportunities can only be exploited by independent and creative creators who understand the value of intellectual property and know their power.
"#selfpub3.0" encourages developers to create several sources of earnings through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
You can earn from direct sales, subscription models, crowdfunding, wide dissemination models and other sources of income, such as online training and related entity activities.
#selfpub3.0 also encourages the distribution of books in a wide range of formats to the widest possible audience through retailers and other services.
The main goal of "#selfpub3.0" is to encourage a change of mindset and to learn how to manage your creative business, so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative asset, is not given to another company in thoughtlessly, such as a specialist publishing house or an independent publishing service provider.
According to Ross, this way creators can increase their income, influence and impact and these methods must be taken into account not only by every creator of the digital age, but also by publishers; she also stressed that the real independence of creators (like other people) is guaranteed by commercial and creative freedom.
The future is here.
And its prospects for independent creators are now the best.
The book Self-Publishing 1.0 describes computer publishing and printing on demand.
The theme of Self-Publishing 2.0 is the sale of books for e-book readers and phones in online book shops.
Now begins a new era of Self-Publishing 3.0, where independent publishers will be trained to start a viable and sustainable business.
The Union of Independent Developers is the only global non-profit organization that unites writers publishing independently books.
The Union’s objective is to develop the skills of independent publishers, to promote ethical activities, to help beginners sell books and to encourage developers to carry out a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
The presidents of the country and the central bank warned the Italian government of the planned deficit
Upon hearing the populist government's plans for a significant increase in deficit spending next year, the Italian president and the head of the central bank warned on Saturday that the country's debt had to be contained.
The ruling parties (opposition Five-star movement and right-north league) submitted a deficit proposal late Thursday evening for 2019, with the deficit reaching 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and three times the target of the previous administration.
This announcement disrupted the market on Friday and prompted bond sales and hit bank shares.
Moreover, such plans are not in line with the European Union, which applies EU fiscal rules and monitors compliance with them.
Addressing the audience at the presidential palace commemorating the 70th anniversary of the constitution, President Sergio Mattarella mentioned that the country's fundamental laws "require the budget to be balanced and the debts to be held in check".
"This is how we will protect our citizens' savings," he said.
Ignazio Visco, President of the Bank of Italy, said at a conference held a little later in central Italy that it is no longer possible to further increase the country's debt, which is the largest of all the major economies of the European Union and reaches 131 percent of GDP.
"Italy must prioritise public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt," Visco said, according to the state news agency Ansa.
'The debt must be reduced gradually.'
Northern League leader and deputy prime minister Matteo Salvinis responded to Mattarella's words that the debt had increased due to the strict requirements imposed by Brussels for years.
"Slow down, Mr. President," said Salvinis in a statement.
"The public debt has been swelled due to the budgets imposed by Europe for years. Finally, we are changing plans and seeking a better future and growth."
Even earlier, before Mattarella or Visco spokesman Luigi Di Maio, chief of the Five Star Movement, said that previously stolen money would be returned to the people" from the budget, but added that the government was not seeking to oppose the EU or financial markets.
The ruling parties pressed Giovanni Tria, an unaffiliated economic minister with no group, to endorse their planned deficit spending.
Italian media said that Mattarella supported Tria's failed attempt to keep a budget deficit below 2 percent of GDP.
The presidents of the country and the central bank have no direct influence on economic policy.
The 77-year-old president can reject the law and return it to parliament, but only once.
The parliament can then again pass the law unchanged and legitimise it.
Official information: Indonesian tsunami sensors missed huge waves
The Indonesian Geophysics Agency cancelled the tsunami warning 34 minutes after its release, and later a severe earthquake occurred, sending giant waves towards the northeast coast of Sulawesi Island, where hundreds of people were killed and thousands left homeless.
Car crashes after tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018.
At least 384 people were killed in a magnitude 7.5 earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu, approximately 1,500 km (940 miles) from Jakarta.
Officials on Sunday said the death toll was likely to rise.
On Friday, numerous people gathered for a festival on Palu Beach, which was struck by many of the six-metre (18 ft) tall waves that had perished after dark.
Geophysics agency BMKG received criticism on Saturday on social media: many people wondered if the tsunami warning was not lifted too soon.
The agency said that it had followed the standard procedure and decided to withdraw the warning based on data from the nearest flood sensor located about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
“We have no observation data from Palu.
Therefore, we had to make a decision based on the data we had," said Rahmat Triyono, head of the BMKG Earthquakes and Tsunami Center.
In the near future, the tide meter, which measured sea level changes, found only, he said, a "minor" wave of six centimetres (2.5 in) and overlooked giant waves at Palu.
"If we had a flood meter at Palu or obtained data from there, of course, the situation would be better.
This must be considered in the future," said Triyono.
According to officials, the tsunami hit Palu and surrounding areas at a huge speed of hundreds of kilometres per hour, but it is unclear if it occurred before the warning was lifted or later.
Residents inspect corpses on the street in search of their family members after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018.
"Based on the videos distributed on social media, we believe that the tsunami occurred before the warning was officially withdrawn," said Triyono.
The magnitude 9.5 earthquake that caused the most damage occurred on the second Christmas Day of 2004 and caused a giant tsunami that killed approximately 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, including 126,000 casualties in Indonesia.
The picturesque city of Palu, with a population of 380,000, is located at the narrow mouth of the bay in the northeast of Sulawesi Island.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), tsunamis devastated the city in 1927 and 1968.
According to Baptiste Gombert, a geophysics researcher at the University of Oxford, the earthquake was not supposed to cause a tsunami.
Friday's earthquake occurred due to a horizontal fracture—the adjacent tectonic panels moved horizontally rather than vertically as usual for tsunamis.
"It is believed that there was a landslide at sea, which pushed a lot of water and caused a tsunami," he said and added that the force of waves moving towards the shore could concentrate in a narrow bay.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster relief agency, told correspondents that his team was "ready to send easy-to-understand public warnings" when the tsunami warning was suddenly lifted.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, text messages with warnings were repeatedly sent to residents, but Nugroho said that the earthquake caused the area's power and communications lines to be cut off and there were no sirens along the shore.
Indonesians on social media questioned whether the BMKG should have withdrawn the tsunami warning, and resented that the information had not been provided in time.
"I am disappointed... Warning cancelled... And the tsunami still happened..." – Twitter user @zanoguccy sent a live message to BMKG.
Golf: Mollywood duo intends to beat ticketing records
After winning the fours competition on Saturday, Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood became the first two from Europe to win in all four pairs of games, and will likely be recorded in history, as representing Europe is already leading by a score of 10:6 against the Ryder Cup Final.
After defeating Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau by a score of 5:4, they became the first European couple to win all four games.
Only Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins were able to do so in 1979.
Rabbiting results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – show not everything.
The pair defeated Woods, who won 14 important titles, three times and won twice against Patrick Reed.
They also won a victory over Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, a USA team this week that won the other three competitions.
Molinari and Fleetwood will have the chance to become the first Europeans to win five points out of five available in Sunday unit competitions.
Fleetwood has already earned the most points in the Ryder Cup unit competition as a rookie European.
The couple, which a crowd of new fans called “Mollywood”, did not seem to be able to lead the European team forward at first glance.
No such performance is expected from Ryder Cup recruits such as Fleetwood, and Molinari did not win any of the previous six games and landed the contestants in four.
However, there was hope: Fleetwood was the first in Europe last year, knows the Le Golf National field as his five fingers and here he won the French Open tournament in 2017 and demonstrated a determined temperament during this year's U.S. Open.
Molinaris is the new British Open champion and is considered by many to be the most consistently ball-beating player of the European tournament – a useful feature in a tight field where tall grass can lead to ruin, as demonstrated by American failures.
These player traits and a harmonious game in the field made them insurmountable.
"I feel a little sensual now, and only Saturday," said Fleetwood, who is famous for his relaxation and played with a wide smile on his face all weekend.
This afternoon we performed well, played steady and well.
If we take note of it together in history, it will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we tried for the team."
Molinari was also overjoyed.
"It was great to play with Tommy," he said.
"But we have to fulfill our duty and not just get into the record books, so tomorrow we will have to struggle hard for the 4.5 point we need to win; it won't be easy."
Knights fever!
A hamlet in Ireland became a medieval battlefield
Claregalway Castle in the west of Ireland was formerly the main fortress of a powerful, English knight-born 15-century family and was remembered for its origin this Saturday.
Knights' duel with swords during the medieval fighting festival at Claregalway Castle in Galway, Ireland, 29 September 2018.
The courtyard of a completely restored Anglo-Norman period house with a tower has been converted into a medieval battlefield in which numerous enthusiasts from all corners of the world have restored contact battles and games to trifles, which were popular many centuries ago.
Karl Dornan, dressed as a knight, and a Celtic warrior costume to wear Donna Dornan patrols the great hall of Claregalway Castle during a medieval fighting festival in Galway, Ireland, 29 September 2018.
"This is a great weekend trip and something unusual," Denise Fitzgerald of Kerry County, who became the hostess of the tavern for the weekend, said while cooking vegetables in the lard at the fire.
“This brings us back to the simplest of things.
I'm trying to do everything as necessary," said a theatre worker, who was taking part in the armed fighting festival for the first time.
In the field, authentically armored fighters competed and although their swords were dull, the helmets of some were folded and one injured the lip.
Horsemen demonstrated their skills by riding and cutting cabbages and aubergines in half.
Close by the metal castings, the bitched guns, the spice merchants prepared the medicine, and the craftsmen spun and painted the wool.
Seriously disposed and handsomely dressed, the participants tried to empathize with the roles.
"I think that anyone can wear a costume, but being empathetic about the role is an art," said Helena Stackpoole, who played Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald and had a unique opportunity to use her fashion design knowledge.
“All suits are hand-woven.
I've been embroidered my belt for two years, and now I've made a dress, and I've made 800 pearls with my hand on her sleeves alone.
It matters to me," she said.
After the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the death toll rose to 832
According to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, the number of people killed in the aftermath of the Indonesian Sulawesi Island earthquake and tsunami on Sunday has risen to 832 and the area affected is larger than originally thought.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference that many people were trapped in the wreckage after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused six-metre (20 ft) high tsunami waves.
The FBI appealed to a second woman who accused candidate Kavanaugh
FBI agents investigating the case of the U.S. Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh appealed to a second woman who accused him of sexual assault, which was revealed by her lawyer on Sunday.
A report by Deborah Ramirez's lawyer John Clune states that the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh's case will not only cover individual charges of attempted rape brought by federal appeals court judge Conservative Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford at a dramatic Senate hearing this week.
Ramirez accuses Kavanaugh of showing her his penis at a party where he was drunk and held at a Yale University dormitory when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donald Trump succumbed to pressure from moderate Senate Republicans and directed the FBI to conduct an investigation after a meeting of Thursday's Senate, at which University of California Professor Ford made in-depth accusations that Kavanaugh had attempted to rape her at a party held in 1982 when they were both schooled and teenagers.
NBC News reported on Saturday that the White House limited the scope of the FBI investigation.
Short denied this and posted a Twitter message: "I really want them to interview all the people they need at their discretion."
White House spokesman Rajas Shah said the Senate determined the extent and duration of the FBI investigation (the investigation is due to be completed within a week).
"The White House allows agents to do what they are taught," said Shah.
United Kingdom will not abandon environmental or animal protection standards after Brexito
Minister of the Environment Michael Gove said on Sunday that the UK will not abandon environmental or animal protection standards to make trade deals after Brexito.
British Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove arrives at Downing Street in London, 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conservative Party conference event, Gove said it is in the UK's interest to be known for its quality foods and the government will announce a strategy on food this year.
Europe has regained the Ryder Cup in unit competitions
Francesco Molinaris earned fame on Sunday by returning the Ryder Cup to Europe: the Italian defeated Phil Mickelson at the 16th hole and earned a point that helped to achieve the required 14.5 result.
Mickelson surrendered at the pit after releasing the first ball into the water, and after being able to remain Molinaris on the roll-off ground, he became the first European to win all five games a week, although he did not win any of the previous six.
The European victory was already assured that the Italian had released a blow from the starting pitch and the continent's victory lacked one point, while Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia were leading in the match and had secured at least half a point each.
Early in the day, they took the lead with a score of 10:6 and had to score four and a half points out of a possible 12 to reclaim the trophy and establish their reign at home, continuing since 1993.
Prior to that, the team managed to eliminate the difference of four points and win the unit competition only twice: this was done by the U.S. team at the 1999 Brooklyn and Europe 2012 "Medina's Miracle" competition, but no one expected another stunning return.
Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson, and Tony Finau gave Jim Furyk's team hope of winning the first games, but then Europe's team points went up the entire field.
Thorbjorn Olesen smashed Jordan Spieth, and his teammate, newcomer John Rahm – Tiger Woods: the athlete who won 14 important titles lost four times out of four.
Ian Poulter, who was recognized as the best player in the Ryder Cup, probably received the most ovation this week when the best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, landed him on the 18th roll-out pitch and brought Europe closer to victory.
It was then only necessary to wait for which match to end first, and it was Molinari's game that caused a wave of cheer in the crowd that was the largest in the event's history.
RT World News: German policemen guarding Erdogan used neo-Nazi name as code word
According to local media, secret officials in eastern Germany, who guarded Turkish President Erdogan this week during his visit to Berlin, used the name of the infamous neo-Nazi extremist.
The regional interior ministry said that the criminal police of the Land of Saxony in eastern Germany were investigating two members of the elite anti-terrorist unit SEC.
The men were intended to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his long-awaited trip to Germany.
Officials had to work in secret, so they had to use the code name according to protocol.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, an infamous neo-Nazi who was part of the National Socialist underground (NSU) extremist group that killed eight immigrants from Turkey at the beginning of this century, one Greek citizen and a German police officer.
Local media reports that a strange code name was discovered when two policemen requested permission to access internal documents necessary to fulfill the task.
The commanding officers did not delay and withdrew the policemen.
Saxon criminal police chief Petric Kleine was the first to respond to the news.
He said that the decision to use Boehnhardt's name was "perhaps the most stupid" and thus "apparently ignored the victims and their loved ones".
The Saxon Minister of the Interior, Roland Woller, supported this statement and called the decision "disgusting, terrible and totally unacceptable".
Erdogan's Friday visit to Berlin led to many controversial assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has been criticised for accepting a leader accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit was very important, "because in the event of disagreements, they have to be dealt with in person by meeting".
The public first heard of NSU in 2011 when bodies of Boehnhardt and his accomplice Uwe Mundlos were detected in a burnt trailer in eastern Germany.
One of them is believed to have killed the other and then committed suicide after a failed attempt to rob a bank in the city of Eisenach.
Soon, a third member of the neo-Nazi group, the last surviving Beate'a Zschaepe, was also arrested.
In July this year, a German court sentenced her to life imprisonment for 10 counts of murder.
She denied having contributed to the murders, but her lawyer said that the accused felt moral guilt because she did not try to stop the murders.
Following the NSU scandal, German security agencies received much criticism.
Lawyers, activists and relatives of the victims believe the group had many more accomplices.
It also became clear that the German internal intelligence agency "BfV" had infiltrated many informants into the NSU and had constantly interfered with the investigation of murders, attempted murders and robberies associated with the group.
Muskas withdraws from the position of Tesla CEO and will have to pay a fine of $20 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elon Musk agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, who sued him for fraud with Twitter messages, in which he said he would make Tesla a private company.
Musk will have to retire as manager, but will remain CEO.
The documents of the agreement indicate that Muskas is to leave the position of Chairman of Tesla's Board of Directors within 45 days and will be prohibited from returning to the position for three years.
In addition, he will have to pay a fine of $20 million.
It all started with a Twitter message that was overwhelming or intentionally written misleadingly, so Musk will have to get confirmation in advance before saying or announcing about Tesla "in any format, including but not limited to, posts on social media (e.g. Twitter), the company's website (e.g. company's blog), press releases and calls to investors".
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because it did not check Musko's initial Twitter message.
In a complaint of the Securities and Exchange Commission Musk is accused of misleading investors on 7 August via a Twitter message, in which he said he had found funds to make Tesla a private company worth $420 per share – making the company's securities more expensive than 10 percent.
Musk soon withdrew his words stating that Tesla would remain public and angered the investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that Musko's initial statement "was wrong and misleading because it did not base itself on facts."
Musk himself explained in a blog entry that this mistake could be justified: after a meeting with a representative of the Saudi Independent Wealth Foundation, he had the impression that he had managed to agree on funds.
Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission were reportedly close to a softer penalty – Musk would have had to give up the chairman's position for only two years and would not have to plead guilty, but Musk declined this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday, Tesla's stock price fell and most likely as a result, he changed his opinion again and agreed to stricter terms.
However, under the new agreement, as under the old one, Musk does not have to plead guilty to mistaking investors.
The Patriarch of Alexandria undertook to support the canonical church of Ukraine and urged orthodox people to unite
Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria stated based on the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
He spoke in response to the separation of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
Theodore II arrived on Thursday in the city of Odessa in the south of Ukraine and met with the church's highest representatives and believing orthodox.
The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchs, yielding only to the ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
"I have come to tell you: do not abandon the orthodox faith and the canonical church," Patriarch Theodore II said in his address.
Prior to his visit to Odessa, he met with Metropolitan Savva of the Polish Orthodox Church, who also supports the canonical church of Ukraine.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to legitimize the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
"We will always support those who seek orthodox unity," Theodore II promised.
The Orthodox Church has recently gone through a major crisis following the decision of the Patriarchate of Constantinople to recognize the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinople decided to send exarches to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting one orthodox church from interfering in the affairs of another.
The Exarchs are special representatives of the Patriarch, formally occupying a higher position than Metropolitan Onufriy, who is the current head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Moscow Patriarchate reacted angrily to Constantinople's actions and cancelled all general church services and memberships in organizations led or co-chaired by representatives of Constantinople.
However, it is claimed that by this decision Constantinople was warned not to take other hostile action and is not considered to have completely broken the ties between the two churches.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, other churches recognize only one – the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
Most Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the breakaway churches, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, owned by the Kiev Patriarchate, which emerged in the 1990s.
This religious movement even has a patriarchal self-proclaimed leader, Filaret, seeking official recognition of the Orthodox Church, full independence and equality with the Moscow Patriarchate.
Damascus opened Syria-Jordan's main trade crossing for the first time in three years
According to the state news agency SANA, the Syrian government said it would open a crossing of the Nasib border border border adjacent to Jordan, which was closed for three years due to hostilities in the area.
This can be done because militants on the Syrian side abandoned the lands near the city of Daraa.
Nasib is the most important trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between Lebanon and the Persian Gulf.
Key points from Lavrov's UN speech
While visiting the UN, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov attacked the West for "political blackmail and brutal force" and said that diplomacy must not succumb to dictatorship and unilateral sanctions.
At the UN General Assembly on Friday, the Minister said that some Western countries are exerting pressure on others without remorse in an attempt to maintain "the positions of the world leaders themselves assigned to themselves".
He did not name specific countries, but said they were using "political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world must pay a high price for the selfish ambitions of a small group of countries.
Lavrov, who has represented Russia at the UN for a decade, said at the meeting that the culture of diplomacy and negotiation is being changed by a dictatorship and unilateral sanctions applied without the approval of the UN.
The Minister said that the sanctions imposed on many countries were "illegal or inefficient" and recalled the blockade against Cuba imposed by the United States for many years.
"But history has not taught us anything," said Lavrov and added that "Western supporters tend to impose guilt only if it is "very likely".
We remember how often interference and wars were justified by such unfounded accusations, such as the 1999 bombings in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 interference in Libyan affairs."
Of course, Lavrov did not mention all Western invasions and recalled the Syrian Seven Years' War as one of the most recent cases.
The failed attempt by extremists to overthrow the Damascus regime could have been disastrous for the whole country and open the door to the establishment of a "terrorist caliphate".
Lavrov praised the Astana peace process, which was jointly launched by Russia, Turkey and Iran, and said that the process helped prevent the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as ISIS) and other groups who wanted to seize Syria as a whole.
The most important thing now is to rebuild the war-torn areas of the country and help refugees return home safely.
Lavrov returned to the struggle of great forces and said that the UN was actually founded "after learning from World War II".
The Russian Foreign Minister recalled that 2018 is the turn of 80 years since the signing of the "famous" Munich Treaty in 1938, by which France and Britain agreed to allow the Nazis to annex the German-populated part of Czechoslovakia in order to appease Hitler.
Although British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said that the Treaty of Munich would "bring peace to these times", a year later war broke out.
The München Treason shows how far "the egoism of countries and the disregard for international law" can lead, Lavrov said.
"The dictatorship and forcibly of the colonial era must be placed in a historical archive or trash can."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the problems of the world, Lavrov said.
"If you have questions or reproaches, sit down and talk, reveal the facts, listen to your colleague's arguments and try to reconcile interests."
Crisle of a stranger's eye?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are surrounded by haze and Bibi's finger taps into Iran
The Israeli Prime Minister asserted in a speech by the UN General Assembly that Tehran had secret nuclear weapons.
It is possible that Israel itself, who accuses others, is hiding something.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister who likes to present, revealed the news on Thursday – he showed photographs of high-scoring photographs with places where Iran allegedly holds nuclear materials.
Tehran responded quickly that Tel Aviv would rather take care of its "undeclared nuclear weapons program".
Although Israel never recognized (but did not deny) the possession of nuclear weapons, RT journalist Murad Gazdiev tried to find out if Tel Aviv should actually look for a log in his eye.
Scottish Government: No complaints against Alex Salmond have been filed before January
The Scottish government said that no complaints had been recorded against Alex Salmond until January of this year.
The former First Minister was charged with two counts of sexual harassment in January, although he strongly denies them.
He was informed of the investigation in March.
Salmond, who resigned from the Scottish National Party, will litigation with the Scottish Government over the complaint process against him.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first dealt with in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been recorded until January.
A Scottish government spokesman said: “The Scottish government received two complaints in January against Alex Salmond.
We could have ignored them or concealed them.
Previously, the then Deputy First Minister did not receive any complaints about Alex Salmond and, as we have already said, the First Minister heard for the first time about the investigation from Alex Salmond in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legitimacy of our processes and will insist on our position.
The Scottish Government will endeavour to obtain as much information as possible within the time available.
However, as we have already mentioned, we cannot comment more on Mr. Salmond's case at the moment for legal reasons."
Alex Salmond’s spokesman said: “We will not comment on anything, because our petition against the Permanent Secretary is now being examined at a court hearing and we hope that a decision will be made soon.
We'll speak in court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's complaint procedure against Alex is illegal."
Glasgow smashed the Dragons with a score of 29:13: a spur by Warriors player Lee Jones
Glasgow regained the title of winners in the Guinness Pro14 league by earning additional points and defeating Dragons at Scotstoun Stadium, and coach Dave Rennie does not hide satisfaction, but believes that the game may have been more accurate.
After the surprise defeat of the Southern Kings team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie asked the much changed team to try and even though she was able to collect the necessary points to stay at the top of the A Conference, the match played in windy and rainy weather was definitely not smooth.
"I think we defended ourselves perfectly tonight, played on the right side of the square and our strategy was good," Rennie said.
“We have to play more accurately and we have been able to exploit more opportunities.
The conditions were unfavorable.
We have created many opportunities, and we are pleased about that.
We need to play more accurately, but 40 or 50 points earned today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We won the extra points, but next week we have to do more to play at home with Zebre, and next week we have to do more with Saracens in Europe."
Although the weather was windy, the Glasgow team began scoring early, but the IOM caught all of Huwo Jones' lost balls, including his catch of Niko Matawalu's internal pass on the left corner.
The disappointment did not last long: left pole Ollis Kebble broke through in the middle in the fourth minute, and Adam Hastings easily caught the pitch.
The Dragons reduced the difference when Arwel Robson received the penalty, and the guard turned the other player down immediately after the 20-minute mark and the Welsh earned a point.
After a relatively quiet first half, the match started almost reaching the half-hour mark: Glasgow quarterbacks consistently attacked the Dragons line, then a South African judge, Stuart Berry, punished the Welsh in the 22nd minute for a sideline guard on the Hastings side.
Warriors went into a fight, but lost the ball after a smooth transfer, as the left edge of Matawalu, which received several hits, could not control the ball and it was passed to the left.
A second attempt was made two minutes after the interval: Hastings broke the "Dragons" line and cleverly handed the ball over to the promiscuous Lee Jones.
The ball was returned to Hastings for his position and the score became 12:6 in the middle of the match.
Glasgow had a very successful first minute of the second half: the ball of the demolished Alex Dunbar was caught by Lee Jones for the second attempt, and was assisted by Hastings.
However, Warriors did not give up after the failure – after just four minutes they took the ball in the middle of the square and the Dragons center Adam Warren swept it under the gate, earning points, and later took over Josh Lewis after an open game with Robson.
The Warriors quickly returned to the lead position and earned additional points in the 54th minute after the fourth attempt when Huwas Jones ran to the right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (which was the third failure of the four tries).
Glasgow maintained a comfortable higher position and made a fifth try with a few minutes left – Dunbar passed the ball after a fight with George Horne, and Hastings scored.
Kebble was declared the best player of the match, but Rennie praised Hastings.
"They obviously interfered with us playing, but we broke off at the middle of the game," said the coach.
“He lacked a few meters, but was slippery and still managed to move away.
He's in good shape and confident."
"Ayr United" defeated "Morton" by a score of 1:5: five-star "Ayr" smashed the host team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore each scored two goals, and Declan McDaid added another one and thus helped Ayr stay at the top of the championship table.
"Ayr" erupted ahead after Shankland's goal scored from six yards after Michael Rose's cornerstroke on McDaid.
In the 35th minute, Morton evened the score on the first attempt when Charlie Telfer took the ball from Robbie Crawford, who hesitated, on his own court and sent him past Ayr goalkeeper Ross Doohan to the far edge with a low kick.
Players from Greenock in the fourth minute of the second quarter had a chance to advance when Doohan knocked Gary down Oliver, but Michael Tidser released a weak penalty kick that the goalkeeper easily caught.
In the 74th minute, Ayr outlasted the contestants for the second time when the long-range transmission of alternate Craig McGuffie was batted in the air and dropped to the ground was sent to the gate by another alternate player, Craig Moore.
Moore handed the ball over to Shankland in the same minute, who scored 17 goals this season.
As the fans rallied, Moore returned to his side fourth from the edge of the pitch, and McDaid sent the rebounding ball to the gate.
"Alloa" and "Falkirk" ended with a 0:2 score: first victory for young people in the league
"I am happy, I feel a relief, I am happy", – rejoiced Ray McKinnon after the much needed first Falkirk victory in the league and earned points of the season.
Rangers borrowed striker Zak Rudden (18 years old) earned a goal in both quarters and pushed the host team "Alloa Athletic" to the bottom of the championship and freed the club from distressed troubles.
"It was an important game for us," McKinnon acknowledged.
“We probably deserved more in the last three matches, so it was great to score three points in a tense situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It wouldn't have led to anything, but it was important for us to win."
Rudden sent the ball to Patrick Brough in the 26th minute and scored a goal from the gate line in the middle of the second quarter when Diamond Petravičius slowly kicked the ball over goalkeeper Neil Parry.
"We wanted to defend ourselves firmly, but failed," said Jim Goodwin, head of Wasps.
Hearts fans petition for semi-finals received more than 11,000 signatures
More than 11,000 people signed a petition of Hearts fans regarding the schedule of the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Sirgals are angry at the decision to host both semi-finals on the same day and at the same stadium.
With the advice of the Scottish Police, the SPFL decided last week to host the Aberdeen–Rangers play-offs at 12:00 and Hearts–Celtic at 7:45, thus provoking the rage of both the Jamba and Dons fans.
The Evening News together with Aberdeen Evening Express on Saturday together asked fans for a fair solution.
The decision of the so-called "Super Saturday" was condemned by both "Aberdeen" and "Hearts": both clubs issued statements criticizing the schedule.
On Thursday, a petition was posted on change.org, requiring one of the matches to be moved to another venue or date.
The man is accused of stabbing two women in the village of Kent
Two women, who went in their sixties and eighties, died at the crime scene.
According to a police spokeswoman, another man, who also exceeded the age limit of 70, is hospitalized and is in stable condition.
A 28-year-old living on the same street remains in custody and will be tried on Monday for two murders and one assassination attempt at the Medway magistrates' court hearing where he will attend a video link.
Police have not yet named the victims, but believe they knew the suspect.
Neighbours said that they were shocked by an event in the village that they said was "silent and friendly".
The 31-year-old Sophie Moorey-Brown said to the Press Association: "Here we live for five years and have never heard of any bad incidents – it is always very quiet and pleasant to live here."
The Royal Archives and the creators of the musical Hamilton will shine the world around King George III
When the Queen presented the project, through which a huge archive of documents accumulated during George III's reign was opened, it was hoped that letters, diaries and speeches would help the public to get to know the king considered mad.
These documents will now reach a different audience – the Royal Archives decided entirely unexpectedly to collaborate with the Westend musical.
Academics who wanted to reveal the king's true face invited George III, who plays in the musical Hamilton, to the Library of Windsor Palace, to review the most important documents from the reign of the queen's great-great-great-grandfather.
Researchers try to make old manuscripts accessible to a wider audience, so a large crowd of fans of the show will be able to access digital documents.
Members of the royal family have already publicly supported the creation of the musical, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will watch the performance twice, although Prince Harry's ancestor is constantly parodied on stage.
Michael Jibson, who plays King in Westend, said that the documents made me think and helped me to get to know the king, whose image was formed by the musical Hamilton, the film Madness of King George, and the series Terrible Stories for Children.
"We fell in love after beautiful letters"
U.S. President Donald Trump did not name enthusiasm after an attempt to reduce tensions with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unu and said at a meeting of his supporters on Saturday that they had "been in love" after correspondence with letters.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim said they would seek nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula – which they discussed at an unprecedented meeting that took place this year in Singapore.
Before moving to a new phase in history after years of public controversy, the leaders of the countries exchanged threats and insults as North Korea wanted to develop a nuclear missile capable of reaching the United States.
“I was as strict as he was.
We used to make a constant confession," Mr. Trump said at a meeting in West Virginia.
“And then we fell in love, you know?
Indeed, he wrote me beautiful, great letters."

Skvernell's accent on Shimonyte: everything decided by the party's "cream"
Prime Minister Saul Skvernell says there was a lack of democracy in the Conservative internal elections, and the party leadership actually appointed Ingrid Shimonyte as the presidential candidate.
"The celebration of 'democracy' itself was however strange, to say the least, when the cream of the party, the summit decided and actively supported one candidate.
Probably there was no chance for a second candidate to win even theoretical," S. Skvernelis told reporters in the Government
"The Conservatives have appointed their candidate, with this and we congratulate them," the premier added.
The "State Green" delegated premier said that Shimonyte should be appreciated by voters after remembering her work in Andrew Kubilius' government.
Mr Skvernelis has not yet commented on whether he will take part in the presidential election.
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania intends to approve its candidate next year.
The leader of the ruling " peasants" Ramūnas Karbauskas called the Conservative election a "failed experiment" due to the low activity of the partyians.
"First of all, it is necessary to welcome an experiment that has absolutely failed.
Only 55% of the party's members participated, with a total turnout of only about 20,000 voters.
Knowing what money needed to be spent on organising those elections, it is accordingly clear that it did not work," said R. Karbauskas to the news portal delfi.lt.
"I think the costs will not justify the result because the result is none, the party has decided that their candidate is - it's all right, but for whom to spend so much money," he added.
During the internal elections, 79% of the Conservative members and their supporters voted for the nomination of I. Šimonytė during the weekend.
Lithuanian salaries make Estonians laugh: one area can change everything
According to the Baltic Salary Survey, which organizes remuneration surveys this year, wages have grown mainly in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia are not far behind their neighbours, according to the company's press release.
"Having surveyed 850 companies and examined the changes in remuneration in the Baltics, we see that this year the monthly pre-tax salary in Lithuania grew by 81.8% of employees and on average increased by 7.7%, while the annual wage with bonuses – by 10.5 percent.
Latvia slightly overtook us - here the annual salary rose slightly more, but as in Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our state," says Povilas Blusius, the spokesman for the company that organizes the remuneration research and adds that if such wage growth trends are present, the country's overall economic indicators, which dictate them, should also be taken into account.
In Estonia, wage growth has been the fastest
Although Latvian and Estonian salaries rose to a lower proportion of employees than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, annual wages grew by 71% of the employees of the companies surveyed and reached slightly more than in our country - 11 percent.
In Estonia, remuneration rose 73% of employees this year and on average increased by 13 percent.
Trends in wage growth are also strongly influenced by staff turnover, as job changers can receive much higher pay than in the previous job.
For those who have not changed their jobs in Lithuania in recent years and have not risen in office, the annual salary increased by 8.8% - more often here than in the other Baltic States, bonuses have been paid.
In neighbouring Latvia, the annual increase in remuneration for such employees was only 3.6 percent.
Estonia remains the leader in the Baltic States not only as the average wage increase for new workers, but also for long-term workers.
For those who did not change jobs or duties, the pay rose the fastest here: monthly - 6%, annual, including bonuses - as much as 9 percent.
According to the remuneration research specialist, such trends often depend on, or go hand in hand with, the country's general economic indicators: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, the state's monetary policy, and prevailing market moods.
For example, forecasts of the coming economic downturn encourage businesses to act more prudently and invest less.
Dominant and fastest growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction, and pharmaceuticals, can also generate general statistics and obscure smaller changes.
The Latvians bear the highest tax burden
When comparing the increase in remuneration, it is also important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees pay the highest share of taxes depending on salary - as much as 31 or 34%, which may increase to 42.4 percent for those who earn more.
There is a constant 24% rate in Lithuania, so with higher wage growth in Latvia, employees may have the same or even lower perceived increase than in Lithuania.
The tax rate applied in Estonia is similar to 23.6 percent in Lithuania, so in this country we find the most favourable taxation of labour in the Baltic States.
In IT, the most competitive salaries
According to the results of the survey, in all Baltic States, the positions of IT specialists remain among the best paid.
The opposite situation in retail is one of the lowest market indices in this field, so employees earn lower than the market average income.
Compared to the previous year, the fastest pay growth occurred for engineering professionals with higher positions, as well as for risk management professionals.
This increase in remuneration did not overtake some positions in the IT field as well - a significant number of organizations' information security specialists increased their monthly salaries by up to 14 percent.
At the same time, wages remained relatively stable at retail level.
However, some companies have successfully restructured their remuneration systems, so the annual wage for bonuses has risen by about 2 percent.
According to remuneration specialists, there is a tendency that wage growth dictates the need for the most demanded specialists as well - the demand for system analysts continues to grow in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande suffers again: ex-fiancé keeps making fun of
After his divorce from Ariana Grande, the distraught Pete Davidson pours out his pain by creating jokes about their relationship.
While attending Saturday Night Live, he chose to joke about how he is rushing into a serious relationship too quickly.
The fans say that it is true that just three weeks ago, Ariana and Pete canceled their engagement, which took place after only a few months of dating.
Pete tried to create scripts that mention his failed relationship, but this would end up on the screens a little later.
Rumor has it that the humorist who mocks his former relationship annoys Arian herself.
Such jokes hurt her, and they don't hurt her heart.
At least that's how secret sources told the foreign news portal TMZ.
White or brown: what kind of sugar a dietician recommends to choose
White or brown?
Which sugars to choose from?
The survey revealed that while Lithuanians still traditionally prefer white sugar, it is surprising that many Lithuanians refuse this ingredient, which was called white death.
The fact that sales of brown sugar are growing is not hidden by supermarkets either.
According to a spokesman for Maximos, brown sugar is becoming more and more popular and nationals buy more and more of it, although regular white sugar is still the first by choice.
Sales of organic sugar are also growing in specialist stores of organic products.
One of the most popular products there - coconut sugar.
According to dietetician Dalia Vaitkevičiūtė, the main difference is price, and harmful health effects can be both.
"Rudasis unrefined sugar is three times more expensive, but from a health point of view these sugars after multiplying them, consuming their excess is harmful to the body," said D. Vaitkevičiūtė.
For those who cannot live without sugar, the dietian advises us to gradually reduce the amount of sugar in our daily routine.
By doing this - the benefits in all ways - the unwanted kilograms will also fall, and health will also improve.
Using less sugar consistently for a month, it will be easier to give up it at all.
"Every habit we form in about a month's time, so after conducting such an experiment, let's say, while drinking some sugar-free product - coffee or tea for a month, we will see how positively this will work and I think that everyone can give up a little effort," the idetologist gave the advice on how to give up sugar.
Doctors claim that white sugar has been dubbed ‘white death ’ for good reason, since the abuse of sweets can lead to obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases.
Therefore, it is worth trying to use it as little as possible, especially since this product is added to many foods, even bread.
Another step of Lietkabelis: Lipkevičius lends to another LKL team
Panevezys Lietkabelis team said goodbye to Vytenis Lipkevičius - the striker is on loan to Prienai Skycop team.
In this season of "Betsafe-LKL" V.Lipkevičius would throw 6.4 points in 22 minutes, rebound 2.8 balls, perform 2 performance transfers and score 8.5 efficiency scores.
In the FIBA Champions League, 29-year-old 198 cm tall athlete statistics reached 3.8 points, 2.5 rebounds, 1.5 touchdowns and 4.8 utility scores in the 21 minute of play.
In the near future, Lietkabelis will announce a new purchase, which will strengthen the composition.
S.Buškevicas joined the coaching staff
Panevezys Lietkabelis team's assistant head coach Nenadas Chanakas was Sandis Buškevicas, who was well known to Lithuanians.
The 41-year-old Latvian played in Vilnius Lietuvos Rytas during the 2005-2006 season, and in 2014-2017 he worked in this club's system as an assistant head coach.
Last season, Buškevic coached the Jekabpils team.
Director of Sport Jonas Vainauskas invited Stephenas Babrauskas to the staff, but he is still going to continue his career as a basketball player.
Vytenis Jasikevičius had also received an invitation, but it was not possible for both sides to reach an agreement.
S.Buškevic will work together with Robertas Kuncaitis and Algimantas Bružas at the staff of Lietkabelis coaches.
Latvia will join Lietkabelis on Tuesday and will be at Cido Arena during a FIBA Champions League match with Dijon JDA, but we will not see him on the bench yet, as registration ended 24 hours before the start of the match.
Not everyone will enjoy biofuels cutbacks
In order to reduce biofuel prices, more deciduous trees will be felled in Lithuania in 2019, Minister of Environment says.
According to Kęstutis Navickas, this is the way to "influence" biofuel prices.
"We have large accumulations of certain species.
We need to balance (...).
There is a concentration on soft deciduous land, because that is how we can influence the prices of biofuels," Mr Navickas said in the Seimas on Tuesday, presenting the situation regarding deforestation.
According to K. Navickas, this year the price of wood in Lithuania increased by about 20%.
According to the Minister, next year the number of pines will be cut as much as this year and the number of spruce trees - about 80 hectares less.
According to him, more wood felled in Lithuania due to favorable natural conditions.
"This shouldn't be happening next year," Mr Navickas said.
Now 10.2 million ha of forests are state-owned and 800,000 ha are private.
Tackling food prices - a dubious obligation: will encourage buying only in your area
Among the measures proposed by the Ministry of Economy to reduce prices, an obligation for public institutions and organisations to purchase 50% of food products from local producers is proposed, and the news portal 15min.lt is published.
"The law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions, but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office supplies could also be supplied to the buyer in municipalities by the local companies that won the tenders," Minister of Economy Virginijus Sinkevičius said to the portal.
Egidijus Mockevicius, president of the Association of Meat Processors, has no doubt that this provision would discriminate against a part of the businessmen, and it would be difficult to monitor whether the laws are used by peckers.
The measure is also criticised for its inconsistency by Valdas Sutkus, head of the Business Confederation.
Macron urges Europe to defend against Russia and the US
French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday called for the creation of a "real European army" to ensure the ability to protect against Russia and even the United States
Mr Macron, who has been calling for the creation of a common European Union force since his coming to power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
More recently, he gained a weighty argument, with U.S. President Donald Trump announcing that Washington would withdraw from an important Cold War treaty on nuclear forces.
"We have to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States," Mr Macron told Radio Europe 1.
This is the first interview given to radio by him since the beginning of his work in the office of president in May 2017.
"When I see President Trump announcing that he is withdrawing from an important disarmament treaty created after the missile crisis that hit Europe in the 1980s, who will be the main victim? - Europe and its security," said the French leader.
The missile crisis in question was caused by a race for the development of non-strategic nuclear weaponry, which was set in motion at the end of the Cold War, during which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was a key factor in prompting the United States and the Soviet Union to conclude the Middle Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 1987.
"We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a real European army," Mr Macron said in an interview recorded Monday evening in Verden in northeastern France, the president attending World War I battle sites this week before the 100th anniversary of the end of this conflict.
According to Mr Macron, in the situation, "when Russia, which is on our borders, has demonstrated a potential threat... we need a Europe that is better protected by itself than simply dependent on the United States."
The French leader became the main initiator who pushed the project to set up forces from nine European countries capable of rapidly conducting a joint military operation, evacuation from the war zone, or providing assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
The defence ministers of these nine countries will meet for the first time in Paris on Wednesday to discuss the details of how these forces will operate.
The European Union has also set itself to significantly increase its defence budget from 2021 onwards and to devote around €13 billion to research and development of new technologies within seven years.
The current EU defence budget is less than €600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomar of the French Military School, which trains high-ranking officers, said Mr Macron's vision of a closely unified European defence was difficult to implement.
"The idea of building a culture of common strategy is not bad," he told AFP news agency.
- But there is a huge gap between the European defences that Emmanuel Macron dreams of and the reality - the very great disagreements between Europe's partners."
Lukashenko threatened NATO with missiles: we're not idiots
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated on Tuesday that his country would need new arms if NATO continued to mobilize forces on Belarus' western border.
"If NATO continues to intimidate, deploying bases in Poland or anything else, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, especially missiles," the state news agency BelTA quotes Lukashenko, who met a group of American analysts in Minsk.
The head of state also noted that Belarus already has its own missile manufacturing industry.
"In recent times - you have noticed, and we are not hiding - we have built our own missile industry and produced our own extremely precise (targetable) missile weaponry," the President stressed.
Lukashenko stated last week that Minsk and Moscow were looking for a proper and inexpensive response to plans to build a base in Poland and to name it in honor of US President Donald Trump's "Fort Trump".
"Of course we're worried about this.
If, for example, in Poland they declare that they are prepared to spend millions of dollars in order to deploy some fort of Trump there (...), of course, we are not idiots and of course we are reacting to it," Mr Lukeshenka stated while attending the discussions of the Munich Security Conference's main group in Minsk.
"It is understood, with our main ally, Russia, that we are considering how to respond to all this and how to find an appropriate response at minimal cost," he added.
Western relations with Moscow were severely affected by Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Their ties are also clouded by Moscow's role in the Syrian conflict and this year's March in Britain, believed to be an attempt by Russian special services to poison former double agent Sergei Skripal with nerve paralysing material.
Tensions between Moscow and Washington worsened in October with Trump announcing that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War-time treaty to regulate nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that that move could disrupt the world's security system.
The man who carried out the brutal execution revealed the murder of a footballer who raped his wife
Brazil was rocked by a dreadful crime that resulted in the brutal execution of Daniel Correa Freitas, a football player in this country.
The sportsman was killed during an 18-year-old girl's birthday celebration.
A 24-year-old footballer was found dead in the city of Paraná, in the southeast of Brazil.
He is declared to have been executed: cut genitalia, and severe injuries in the neck area are also reported.
After killing the footballer, 38-year-old Edison Brittes Junior admitted his guilt and claimed that he did so because D.C.Freitas raped his wife Cristian Brittes.
The Brazilian man who committed the gruesome murder later told the television air in detail what happened on the fateful night.
"West had already gained momentum when I realized that I had not seen my wife Cristiana anywhere for a long time.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
I broke the door before anything, and saw Daniel lying naked in bed, and my wife, who asked for help.
I was pissed to death.
Together with my friends at the party, we dragged him outside and put him in a car.
Here I had a knife with which I stabbed a man who raped my wife to death.
I was very angry, I couldn't do anything to myself at that moment," the murder told me.
Along with his friends, he threw the dead body of the footballer next to the river, where police officers are also searching for the main dreadful crime tool.
Civil Brazilian police detained E.B.Junior, as well as his wife and daughter who celebrated her birthday.
Police officers investigating the event are said to still lack evidence that the woman was raped during the party.
It is true that recently circulated latest footballer's messages and photos on the occasion of WahtsApp can help the course of the investigation.
The footballer sent two pictures to one of his friends through WhatsApp, in which he captured himself in bed, next to a sleeping woman who, as revealed later, is the killer's wife Cristiana.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in various rooms of the house.
I'll eat the anniversary's mom, even though her father is somewhere nearby," the footballer wrote to his buddy.
Daniel Correa Freitas, who was a member of Sao Paulo's club, was loaned out to Sao Bento, who competes in the second-best Brazilian league this season.
The daughter of Paul Walker, who died tragically, celebrates her 20th anniversary: she was not without tears
Meadow's daughter, Paul Walker, who died tragically, has a special occasion - she is 20 years old.
Meadow Walker, who works as a model, lost one of the most beloved people in the world five years ago and is still a wall of silence.
On social media, a very rare girl left her teenage years tearfully celebrating her birthday.
She mentioned it in perpetuation with a little pastry on which the pink number "20" was flaunted.
On the Internet, shots spread in which the girl cries on her birthday, but they were quickly removed from social networks.
After the actor's death, Meadow was raised only by her mother Rebecca Soteros.
Paul Walker's brother and wife repeatedly mentioned that their daughter meant everything to the actor.
He was very proud of her.
Austin Powers fans lost their heads: another part of the film awaits
The cult comedy Austin Powers has fascinated millions of people around the world.
Futuristic, laughing shots and costumes even now become an inspiration to many fans.
The filmmaker and lead star Mike Myers announced that the fourth Austin Powers film was also waiting.
However, one of the main actors who embodies Mini Me will no longer be able to see it.
The actor who played him, Verne Troyer, died early this year, aged 49.
In October, it was confirmed that the actor had taken his own life.
Mike Myers assured me that Verne's world of Austin Powers would really be missing - the film would no longer be the same without it.
Verne was a fantastic comedy actor.
When we wrote the script, his character was not laai special - all the popularity he created himself.
He was a great stuntman, a great dancer and a wonderful man," Mike Myers spoke of him.
Juliette Lewis will join the series "Conners" under "Rozana"
The star of the series "Millions of Particles" and "Stowering" Juliette Lewis confirmed on Twitter that he joined the series "Conners" under "Rozana".
‘Yes, it is.
The secret is revealed! #JulietteLewisisontheconners #TheConners", – this week the actress wrote in a Twitter message and posted a photo in which she holds a script with a situation comedy title.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, Lewis will play Galecki's girlfriend Blue, but it is unclear how many series they will appear.
Conners' debut is scheduled for October.
The ratings of the series returned this spring were high and it was renewed for another season, but its creator and star Roseanne Barr were also cancelled in May because they shared a racist joke about a former Obama administration official on Twitter.
The "Conners" will feature most of the original "Rozana" team, including Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman.

Showtime refused to order the third season of Jim Carrey's produced drama-comedy "I am dying here".
The website Deadline.com states that the cable television network cancelled the series due to low viewing.
The series, featuring Melissa Leo, Aria Graynor, Michael Angarano, Clark Duke, R.J. Cyler, Jake Lacy, and Andrew Santino, took place on stage of live comedy performances in Los Angeles in the 1970s.

I liked her novel very much, and the adaptation reveals even more exceptional things to television," Green said in a statement.
"It was a lot of fun to adapt the novel to television and I am happy to work with wonderful artists from different fields," added Catton.
“Roman is written in solitude, and writing a script is undoubtedly teamwork and I am very happy that the world of “Lights” has expanded and become richer in a way I could not imagine.
It's great that everything will be led by the wonderful Claire McCarthy, and I look forward to seeing this great team play this story."
Hurts of Alabama can no longer take up suspension
Alabama backup player Jalen Hurts will no longer be able to be suspended for this season after this Saturday.
Hurts is included in the top ranked Crimson Tide Saturday match against the weaker Louisiana team and this is the fifth player match this season.
The NCAA applied a new rule this year – a player who participated in four matches can be suspended.
This month Athletic announced that Hurts had planned to do so due to conflicting assessments of the player and the team's coaching staff responding to them.
Tua Tagovailoa replaced Hurts at the beginning of the season, but Nick Saban, the Crimson Tide coach, said that he planned to use Hurts' skills anyway.
Last season, Hurts helped Alabama to qualify for the national champion title against the Georgia team, but he was replaced by Tagovailoa for the second half after contributing to the Crimson Tide victory by a score of 26:23.
Former Southeastern Conference quarterback of the year Hurts started the last 28 Alabama games and entered the season with a record score of 26:2.
In Saturday's competition, Hurts completed 22 of 31 transmissions in the first four episodes of the Crimson Tide, ran for 276 yards, scored four times, and took over the ball once.
He also ran with the ball 15 times and ran for 54 yards.
Owens: Dez must not delay signing the contract
Former Dallas Cowboys striker Dez Bryant said he was about to return to the NFL.
Terrellas Owens, a member of the Hall of Fame, said that Bryant would rather not be delayed.
In response to a Twitter question about when to sign a contract with the team, Bryant posted a one-word Twitter message on Friday: "Soon."
Bryant, who has been selected three times for Pro Bowl matches, is not part of any team since the Dallas Cowboys refused him in mid-April following a salary dispute.
Bryant, who may have given up his contract with the Baltimore Ravens and is constantly associated with the Cleveland Browns, said shortly before the season that he wanted to improve before signing his contract with the team.
Owens, who entered the professional American Football Hall of Fame in August, still talking about returning to the NFL, told TMZ that Bryant should try to get back to the sport as soon as possible.
"He must join the team and prove to everyone what he can," stated Owensas to the website.
“All reviewers believe that he is not doing well and that he is not as good as he is.
He now has to enter the team for any salary, accept a one- or two-year contract – it doesn't matter at all – and show everyone what he's capable of."
Bryant caught the ball 69 times on the Dallas team in 2017, ran for 838 yards and scored six times.
The 29-year-old player did not run 100 yards for the longest in his career – 23 competitions.
After signing a five-year $70 million contract in 2015, Bryant did not run for 1,000 yards for any season and did not catch more than eight point-winning balls.
"If the CEO or owner thinks that your skills are deteriorating, you will not be able to secure or accumulate the amount you want," advised Owens.
He also warned that Bryant had to get into the team as soon as possible, as this might not succeed at all later and said that it would be possible to return to the Cowboys who were going through difficult times.
"Of course. I don't know if their relationship is damaged," said Owens, who scored 38 times during three seasons playing in the Dallas team.
"I think that in Dezo's case, if the Cowboys take him back and he gets the chance, it will benefit Dez and the franchise."
The establishment of CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania is under discussion
Last week in Kaunas, representatives of the European Nuclear Research Organisation (CERN), the European Organization for Nuclear Research, are assessing the possibilities of establishing a CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten such business incubators in Europe, where companies receive assistance in commercializing CERN technologies, developing innovative products and adapting them to public needs.
Although Lithuania only became a member of CERN last year, the establishment of the business incubator of this organization was already hanging in the country.
CERN representatives visited the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and the Institutes of Materials Science and Biomedical Engineering of Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) in the Santaka Valley.
At the meeting, guests of the National Innovation and Business Centre (NIVC) together with representatives of KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuanian Energy Institute, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Economy and business discussed Kaunas Innovation Ecosystem and opportunities for young, innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important because if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a significant influence on the region's science and business innovators.
"Such an incubator would promote the application of CERN accumulated knowledge and technologies to solving important problems, e.g. new technologies and artificial intelligence would be used for diagnosis and treatment of diseases, large data processing," says Dr Leonas Balaševičius, Vice-Rector of Science and Innovation at KTU.
CERN incubators, like other young business development centres, provide assistance in business development - provide information and expert advice in the application of technologies in product development and help in the search for funding sources.
The only difference is that the CERN incubator is more science.
Such a center in Lithuania would involve experts from various fields: information technology, materials engineering, as well as medical specialists.
The organization CERN is best known for the great Hadron counterflow accelerator in Switzerland (LHC, The Large Hadron Collider), the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator.
However, CERN does not only carry out research in quantum mechanics, but also in other areas - from cryogenics (effect of very cold temperatures on materials) to particle monitoring and radiation research.
These technologies and works carried out by scientists have an impact on many areas of public interest: medicine, security and industrial development.
Vilniaus Vodka has a new guide
The drink manufacturer Vilniaus Vodtinė AB appointed Rokas Mituzas as the new CEO to replace Raymondas Pilkė in this position.
Since the summer of last year, Mr. Pilke, who headed the company, will continue to serve as finance director of Vilniaus Vodka, according to a report distributed through Nasdaq Vilnius Exchange.
Mr. Mituzas is the co-founder of Buga LT, a sauce-producing company, and is mentioned in his LinkedIn account.
In 2012-2017, Mituzas served as regional director in the SPI Group, and worked in the "Reckitt Benckiser" and "Unilever" groups even earlier.
Vilniaus Vodka finished the first quarter of this year with a loss of EUR 315,500.
Last year the company earned a profit of 392.300 Euros in the relevant period.
The company's sales revenue without excise duty amounted to EUR 4,956 million and decreased by 13,16% compared to the first quarter of last year.
"Vilnius Vodka" employs more than 100 people.
STT detained R.Ačas - Business News
Former parliamentarian and former director of Raseiniai District Municipal Administration Remigijus Ačas is suspected of bribery.
He's in custody.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) informs that officials of Šiauliai Board are conducting a pre-trial investigation into possible corruption in Raseiniai district municipality.
"Former director of Raseiniai district municipal administration R. A. (Remigijus Ačas - Rev.) is suspected of bribery.
The circumstances of the public procurement carried out in a non-transparent manner, R.A. acting as director of the municipality - a possible exceptional favour for one private company to conclude a public contract with an enterprise managed by Raseiniai District Municipality.
It is suspected that R.A. has accepted a high-value (over 250 MSL) bribe for this," according to a STT press release.
BNS adds that this company is the "Raseiniai bus fleet".
On Monday, officials also detained Vladislovas Šimaitis, the suspected leader of the company "Raseiniai bus park", managed by Raseiniai municipality.
This was confirmed by STT spokesperson Renata Endružytė in the BNS.
The STT report stated that the allegations were also made to two representatives of the companies who bribed Mr. Ača directly or were involved in the disguise of bribes in various financial operations.
All suspects are detained, and searches have been carried out at their workplaces and homes.
Suspended LSDD membership
Remigijus Ačas was the director of the Raseiniai District Municipal Administration for some time, but in April, after the council disapproved of his report, he lost this position.
He was also the mayor of this district in 2011-2012 Mr. Ačas - a long-time member of the Seimas, he was elected to parliament since 2004, as a candidate of the party "Surveillance and Justice".
However, in 2013, his and this party's paths were divorced, and he failed to win his mandate independently in the 2016 Seimas elections.
Now Mr. Ačas is a member of the newly founded Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDD) led by Gediminas Kirkilas.
Not long after this news appeared, LSDD chairman Kirkill informed in a press release that Mr. Ach temporarily suspended party membership while the investigation was ongoing.
"The actions and allegations made by the Special Investigation Service to Remigijus Ačas are an unpleasant surprise for us, but in all cases it is necessary for law enforcement to do all necessary actions to find out the truth.
Mr Ačas temporarily suspended membership of the party pending a pre-trial investigation," says Kirkill, leader of the LSDD.
In 2003, Mr. Ach was the head of the advisory team of then-President Roland Paks, who was later removed from office through impeachment.
Mayor Gricius: I did not directly control the works of Mr Ačas
Neither Algirdas Gricius, the mayor of Raseiniai district, nor the current head of administration of the municipality Liudas Kavaliauskas said on Monday that he had no information on what particular purchase might be subject to a law enforcement investigation.
Mayor Gritzius said of Mr. Acho's detention after learning from the media.
"I really can't say we were very dissociated by functions, I was doing my job as mayor, he (R. Achas - BNS) - the work of the administration, and I couldn't say for any reason, or for what public procurement this case was done," the mayor said on BNS Monday.
He also claimed, for the same reasons, that he did not want to appreciate Mr. Acho's former leadership of the municipal administration.
I would be afraid to say something that I could appreciate his activities, because directly I did not control his administrative work, how much he presented to me on public procurement, on competitions, said that there were such public procurements, such tenders, and then what was visible in the public domain was contracts, I already saw as mayor.
Therefore, I cannot describe how he led the administration as its director at the time," Mr. Gricius said.
He said he himself did not interfere in or influence public procurement.
New advisor to the Minister of Culture in the team
The team of advisors to the Minister of Culture Liana Ruokytė-Jonsson was supplemented by assoc. prof. dr. Joseph Blažiunas.
He will advise on archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage management.
The Ministry of Culture announces that Mr. Blažiūnas, who has obtained a doctorate in art science from Vilnius Academy of Arts since 2016, has been the director of the Lithuanian Literature and Art Archive and an associate professor in the Department of Muzeology at the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University.
By the way, in 2017 the students of the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University selected Mr. Blažiūnas as the best lecturer of the Faculty.
The new adviser to the Minister is the author of many scientific papers on cultural heritage and conservation of values.
Kaita Continues
VŽ reminds that in May this year the team of Minister of Culture Ruokytė-Jonsson was left by Dr. Viktoras Bachmetiev, who advised the Minister on public information policy, was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renaldas Augustinavičius announced his resignation as Vice-Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums and libraries.
Ms. Ruokytė-Jonsson then said that the new Deputy Minister she had chosen would curate the same areas as Mr. Augustinavičius.
In addition to Mr. Blažiūnas, who is being mentored by Mr. Augustinavičius, the team of advisors to the Minister consists of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidijus Gailiūnas, Rusnė Rinkevičienė and Eglė Saudargaitė.
Gentvilas: 90 million euro in fines for failing to operate GPAIS
Simonas Gentvilas, Vice-Chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, says that due to poor functioning of the Product, Packaging and Waste Accounting Information System (GPAIS) Lithuanian producers and importers may have to pay almost 90 million euros in fines at the end of the year.
"As the end of the year approaches and the GPAIS system does not begin to function normally, the systemic crisis in the packaging management sector is becoming a more realistic scenario.
It is said informally that certificates confirming the handling of packaging waste have been issued just 1% of the recycling tasks scheduled," Mr. Gentvil states in a press release.
On 7 November Seimūnas initiates an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Environmental Protection, where it is planned to discuss the situation, to find out why the functions of this programme do not work, the reasons for which the module of the programme is not actually implemented and how the Ministry of Environment intends to solve the problem.
"In the absence of the necessary legislative or legislative change initiatives, manufacturers and importers risk getting huge environmental pollution taxes again at the end of this year," Mr. Gentvil says.
In his opinion, the shortcomings and inaction of the GPAIS accounting system signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the "Metrail" crisis.
Concerns about tasks
Some experts also warn that some companies may not be able to meet the state's targets for recycling packaging waste set in 2018.
Upon seeing the results of the first half of the year, the specialists confirm that they see a cause for concern that some organisations may not manage the necessary quantity of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some companies might not be able to benefit from the pollution tax exemption and would receive a pollution tax for a certain amount of their annual packaging placed on the market.
The VK wrote that two of the three existing producer organisations reject such concerns, while one makes no comment.
Kęstutis Pocius, CEO of the largest organisation Public Institution Green Point, said that at least formally it depends on solving problems of product, packaging and waste accounting system (GPAIS).
Green Point plans to manage all types of packaging this year, except for glass.
Although the task of "Green Point" will not be overcome this year, the organization promises to compensate the members for the losses resulting from this.
Experts question the benefits of food vouchers
When the government plans to distribute vouchers to less well-off people for food products and thus promote the family or farmers' trade business, experts question the benefits of such an innovation.
They agree that the new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Marius Dubnikov, Head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Business Confederation, says that vouchers are obsolete and will not solve the problem, and the Government should focus on raising people's income.
"The system seems rather strange and as if taken from older textbooks.
If we are to help the public acquire something or have greater purchasing power, we must direct all the capacity to increase people's income, and people must decide for themselves whether to buy in one store or another," Mr. Dubnikov of BNS said.
According to him, the government would flatter lower-income people by offering food vouchers.
"Clearly, it applies to lower-income people, as if a voucher placed on a tray, on which it would be written, here, we, this Government, have given you a voucher, and be in our favour.
This sounds like certain pre-election promises, where it is desired to attach a very clear signature to them," the analyst said.
According to him, the food voucher system will require additional investment and will increase the administrative burden by monitoring who allows them and how they are protected against counterfeiting.
Nerijus Mačiulis, chief economist at Swedbank, says that with one instrument to achieve both objectives - supporting low-income residents and small entrepreneurs - would not succeed.
"If it is support for small entrepreneurs, the help of vauchers compensates for price differences and residents can buy more expensive goods in smaller shops, the price difference is compensated by the state from the budget.
Then it's support for business, but not support for residents," BNS said Mr. Mačiulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macro-economic impact and would not fundamentally change the competitive position of small shops, but rather would create an additional bureaucratic burden and could make it more difficult for new entrants to enter the market.
"It would seem to be a rather bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and residents would also be rather uncomfortable, they should shop not in some larger store with a larger range closer to home, but look for several specialized stores with a smaller range," the economist stated.
According to him, in other countries vouchers are used when the volume of goods or services is limited and they need to be given to everyone in the same way, or to some social group.
Residents then receive vouchers free of charge and can spend them on food.
According to Mr. Mačiulis, they are also used in the labour market, giving temporary tax relief to companies, employing the long-term unemployed, or, for example, former prisoners.
Such practice, in the words of Mr. Mačiulis, was successfully applied in Lithuania as well.
Prime Minister Saul Skvernelis said on Monday that the government's new food voucher system would help the poorest people, increase competition, and encourage small traders or farmers' businesses.
Prime Minister's adviser Skirmantas Malinauskas told BNS on Monday that the idea is most focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could receive a discount of 20-30%.
According to him, the amount of coupons would be limited so that farmers could not abuse.
According to him, 3-5 vouchers would allow a person to have 10-15 euros of benefits per month.
According to him, although the state budget does not yet provide the funds for the programme, it could be financed from this source, possibly from European Union funds.
"Not everything currently provided or not provided for in the budget will be in the final, yet it will change in the Seimas, so happens, there may be funds transferred from one line to another, and from ministries, to change can funding things.
There is always a matter of priority, what the decision would be - whether to give up something, find another additional source of income and so on," Mr. Malinauskas said to the BNS on Tuesday.
The extent to which and from when innovation can be applied is currently being decided.
