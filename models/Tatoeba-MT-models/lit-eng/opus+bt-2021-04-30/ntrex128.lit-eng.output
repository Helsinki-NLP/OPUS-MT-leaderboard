Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that "it looks like dolls"
Some members of the Assembly were overshadowed by the suggestion to change their name to the MWP (English: Welsh MP).
This relates to the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule at a political level.
One member of the "Labour" assembly said that his group is concerned that "it rhymes with "Twp" and "Pwp".
Not for Welsh readers: In Welsh "twp" means "fool", and "pwp" means "kaka".
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the entire group was "unsatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open" due to the name change, but noted that it was a shortening of the word from MWP to "doll".
For the Welsh letter w is pronounced in a similar manner to the English pronounced letter u of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to change the title, said: "The final decision on the names of all members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals that received strong support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the name of the Assembly members, the Commission preferred Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP received the highest support during the public consultation.
Assembly members are obviously offering alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement may become a headache for Presidency Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to table draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of the Assembly member and the committee system plan.
During the legislative debate, members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on the question of what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum on name change of country
On Sunday voters will vote whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents claims to Greek territory and repeatedly contradicted Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Opposing the plebiscite on changing the name Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is simply a price that just has to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
During Harlem's difficulties, the bells of St. Martin and other churches fell silent
“The old people I talked to said that historically a bar and a church could be found on every corner,” said Adams.
- You can't find one or the other today."
He said it understood why the bars disappeared.
“The way people communicate today is different,” he said.
"The bars are no longer a neighborhood site, where people come together all the time."
Speaking of churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not be enough for long, as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
He added that churches may be replaced with apartment blocks with co-operative apartments that will house people who will not help the extant shrines adjacent to them.
"The majority of people who will buy cooperative apartments in these apartment blocks will be white," he said, "and therefore will speed up the moment churches close completely, as it is unlikely that most of these people who have moved to these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built in 1870 by white Congregations, before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community, and St. Martin's Church was built a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation, which held services nearby, took over the name of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation with cleric John Howard Johnson, who ran a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main store in Harlem, where recruitment or appointment of blacks was refused.
In 1939, the building was badly devastated by fire, but since the parishioners of spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
Clergyman David Johnson, son and heir of the spiritual father Johnson in St. Martin's Church, was proud to call the carillon the bells of the poor.
The experts, who played the carillon in July, called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionysio A. Lindas. 18 years ago he started playing a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him with another musician.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin's Church has been a complicated history of architects and contractors—some of whom were summoned by the laymen of the church, others by the Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
Zacrisia, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, expressed in July the diocese's concern that the diocese would "effort to pass on the costs" to the sacristy, although it did not hire the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
Shark in California injured a 13-year-old catching lobster
Officials reported that the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he was catching lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster-catching season.
It was attacked before 7:00 a.m. in Ensinite near Lighthouse Beach.
Chad Hammel told the San Diego KSWB-TV show that he was diving with friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then came in with the band to help get him out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was worried when he caught the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Hammel said that, as he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone had been torn.
"I started shouting to everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark floating in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown by plane to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was acknowledged to be in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a report to the media that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officials closed the beach from Casablad Pont to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours due to the investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in the zone, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to push into the UK beauty market
"Sainsbury's" is taken over by "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with department store-style beauty departments, where specialist consultants will work.
Actively pushing into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow, while fashion and household goods sales rates are falling, larger beauty product divisions will be tested at 11 stores nationwide and, if successful, more stores will be installed next year.
Investments in beauty are growing, and supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves once designed for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's has announced that it will double its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and for the first time Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in trademark zones similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also re-releases its Boutique makeup range, most of which are vegan – this is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test discounts in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open later this year in Seli Ouk, Birmingham.
Because of online shopping and the desire to buy small quantities every day from local stores of essential goods, supermarkets need to do more to attract people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that branded shops increasingly look like department stores because supermarket chains are trying to fight against selling products cheaper by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's included Argos stores in hundreds of stores and also installed a number of Habitat stores because two years ago they bought both networks, which are said to have strengthened the sale of groceries and their acquisition was more profitable.
The mall's previous attempt to reopen its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended in a dispute about how to distribute income from the stores of pharmacists in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy 281 stores to Lloyds Pharmacy network owner Celesio for £125 million three years ago.
It was argued that Lloyds' contribution to this plan by adding an expanded range of luxury leather care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the exterior and atmosphere of the beauty department to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and because of its attractive environment and convenient locations, we are now an attractive place of beauty, challenging the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "enraged" by the fact that Holly Willoughby terminated a £11 million deal with him
Dragons Den star Peter Jones "enraged" after television presenter Holly Willoughby ended a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Mr Willoughby no longer has time for their household and accessories brand "Truly".
The pair's business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
37-year-old presenter of this Morning show, Instagram, announced that she was leaving.
When Holly Willoughby left a lucrative lifestyle brand at the last moment to focus on his new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, he angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den.
Sources say that Jones was "enraged" when, during a tight meeting on Tuesday, a golden television girl at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe (Bakingamshire) admitted that, due to new deals of up to £1.5 million, she would not have enough time to devote to his household goods and accessories brand "Truly".
The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was supposed to double Mr Willoughby's assets of £11 million.
Since 37-year-old Willoughby reported leaving Truly in his Instagram account, Jones flew from Great Britain to one of his summer homes.
The source said that "Truly" has been one of Holly's top priorities to date.
This was to be her long-term future, which would last for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave was extremely surprising.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
There is a full warehouse of ready-to-sale goods at Marlowe's headquarters."
Experts believe that the exit of The Morning presenter, which is one of the most financially successful stars in Great Britain, can cost the company millions of dollars due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household goods, as well as delays in starting things.
And it could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, H. Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, maintained close ties with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
In 2016, Mr. Willoughby and Mr. Cappu founded "Truly", and Mr. Jones, 52, joined the fight as chairman.
The couples are on vacation together, and Mr. Jones holds a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
H. Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace ITV host Anta McPartlin.
A close source from Jones said yesterday, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
We talked hard and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism from the media about the comment made, which some could consider "non-presidential", and about the fact that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump refuse so much?
The short, mocking voice of the "newsman" said:
"I didn't give up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was supported as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament were stalled.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not receiving a "appropriate response" from the US regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
He noted that the U.S. was instead continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Short expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are doing well with North Korea,” he said.
- We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results: it's the end of missile testing, helping to free hostages and bring home the remains of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual attitude by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people wanting to get into this stuffed arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd standing right in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing hundreds of people
Following the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were deployed, this was not declared a national disaster – a prerequisite for providing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been made very clear that international aid is not needed, so it is a bit complicated," said Sumbung.
Although "Save the Children" prepares a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether workers working abroad will be able to work locally.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to find out if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although cover from the tsunami was built in Aceh, it is not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the issued warning, is likely to lead to an increase in lost lives.
Travelling between many Indonesian islands in the best time is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok, which treats victims of the earthquake, heads to Palu, but it will reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo chose the reconstruction of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure as the center of his election campaign, and he generously spent money on roads and railroads.
However, the lack of funding bothered the Yoko administration, as he would re-enter the election in the coming years.
Yoko also faces pressure due to the persistence of sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adhere to a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows with arrows and other simple weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a distant equalising goal in a match with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League match in the 89th minute after scoring a goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
With their team behind by a score of 1:0, Xherdan Shaqiri handed over the ball about 30 meters from the Chelsea gate to the former Sturridge.
He threw the ball on his left leg and struck toward a far-off shake.
High above the penalty ground, the raised ball flew to the right upper corner of the net.
He eventually passed over the danced Kepa Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
“I was just trying to get into this situation to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to keep as much time for a punch,” said Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante running, I improved the ball with one touch and, not thinking too much, I just kicked it."
After the goal Chelsea scored in the 25th minute by Eden Hazard, the Belgian star took a 1:0 lead from the first quarter.
During that attack, the "blue" striker returned the ball to Mateo Kovacici in the middle of the square with the heel and rushed towards the Liverpool side.
This one quickly played a wall in the middle of the square.
He then aptly sent the ball among his opponents to the penalty ground for the erupting Hazard.
Hazard overtook the defenders and passed Liverpool player Alison Becker with a left leg kick to the net at a long-distance shake.
Liverpool team will play with Napoli at Stadio San Paolo Stadium in Naples (Italy) at 3 p.m. on Wednesday in the Champions League group stage.
Chelsea meets Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami has already reached 832
As reported early Sunday by the country's disaster agency, the number of deaths in Indonesia from the earthquake and tsunami rose to 832.
A spokesperson for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported at a press conference that many people had been jammed in the ruins of buildings destroyed as a result of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday that caused waves of 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000 people, was laid down by the wreckage of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Berkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. at Grayson in Muse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people who had seen or heard in the area to speak.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “While the investigation is early, I would like to address anyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious about them getting in touch with us.
I would also like to address everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have captured someone on the video recorder, and contact us because they might have information that is essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a native of Berkenhead and she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigations are still ongoing as police reported that they are informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said that no one could enter and leave the building.
He lost his word when he found out what happened.
Residents have now been informed that they will have to wait a few hours before they are allowed to return home.
It was heard as a police officer explained to one man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared to be in tears at the crime scene.
She kept saying, "It's so scary."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans stood in front of the barrage on the inside, and another van behind it on the outside side.
Numerous officers stood on the inside of the barrier and watched the block of apartment blocks.
Anyone with information is asked to write @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by phone 0800 555 111, indicating the number 247 on 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is struck with the last blow of the 'rewriting of history' dispute.
Its removal would be poetic justice for the destruction of England's cultural and religious heritage, reminiscent of Taliban actions, under the responsibility of fanatical followers of Cromwell's Puritans.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of J. Crick as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the course of the current debate on the transfer of statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell at the Palace of Westminster must inevitably have become a target.
Cromwell did not order or execute iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The remarkable image of Cromwell created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft is a reflection of the approach of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more numerous than today at the end of the 19th century, Cromwell was seen as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, which was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether this is portrayed with complete precision, historians argue to date.
One thing is clear is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this divide.
His achievements as Lord's protector are also worthy of mention and honour."
A killer pig tore a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, in a market in southwestern China, a pig attacked and tore the farmer to death.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a dead man, whose name is Yuan, had been found. Because of the damaged artery, he had been bled with blood and was lying next to a piggy in the market of Liupanshui, Guizhou Province (Southern China).
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Sining, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to administer vaccines to pigs in a piggy.
He reported that he and his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province were going to travel to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found a relative dead and found a door open to a nearby piggy.
He said there was a large boar in the piggy, whose mouth was stained with blood.
According to the report, forensics confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms had torn the farmer apart.
Guiyang Evening News quotes: "My cousin's feet were bloodied and wounded," said the cousin, stating his surname Wu, .
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. Thursday to feed her pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
Yuan or his cousin was not part of the animal that tore the man.
The head of the market reported to Evening News that the pig had to be locked to prevent other people from being attacked and kept while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for their deaths.
Although few, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly dangerously injured.
Ten years ago, a 75 - pound [295 kg] pig pinned a Welsh farmer to a tractor and pressed him until the animal was chased away by his wife.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood taste can contribute to aggressiveness.
“They’re just playful.
They love biting, very curious... not wanting to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's "remains" will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken, moving through cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, over the coming days, Rosa will bring abundant rain to all of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday from 5:00 a.m., Rosa was moving at 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km southwest of Cape Euchenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific side begins to form an extended area of low pressure and moves eastwards to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to carry high tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 centimetres of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical moisture, interacting with the upcoming extended area of low pressure, will then bring wide-spread abundant rain to the southwest over the coming days.
In place of 2.5 to 10 centimeters, rain will cause a dangerous flash flood, a stream of debris, and a possible landslide in the desert.
High tropical humidity in some places, especially southern Nevada and Arizona, will cause precipitation of between 5 and 8 centimeters per hour.
Rainfall is expected in the southwest regions, especially in much of Arizona.
Due to the disparate nature of tropical rain, sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions can occur.
In the face of a tropical storm, a particularly poor idea would be to move to the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms would cause wind and dust surges.
The approaching extended area of low pressure will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
More than 1 centimeters of rainfall is likely to cause a small stream of debris, and roads may become slippery.
This would be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some tropical rainstorms will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and later rain will spread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain after Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah will spread on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations can occur throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropical zone will be quite warm.
Sometimes this results in huge changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday was a fine example of huge temperature differences in the central United States.
Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, have temperatures nearly 20 degrees different from those of St. Louis and Di Moino, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
In much of the central and eastern United States, from the Great Southern Plains to the northeastern areas, it is expected that a warm October will come with a high temperature of 27 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Fahrenheit) in many places.
In New York City, temperatures are expected to rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the temperature in the eastern United States will be higher than the average perennial temperature in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Bretto Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people on six television broadcasts on Thursday watched the struggling remarks of Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh and the accusations of sexual violence by a woman, Christine Blasey Ford, in the 1980s.
However, the political stalemate continued, with the broadcasters interrupting regular programs due to Friday's last minute change: an agreement was drawn up by the Arizona Senator to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the dropped charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was quite sure that Kavanaugh, who was drunk at a high school party, grabbed her and tried to drag her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in angrily testifying, said that he was absolutely sure that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people may have watched the broadcast.
The company estimated the average number of viewers watching the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in counting persons watching television in offices.
To explain more clearly, it is the same size of audience as would occur during playoff football games or Oscar Awards.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, took the lead from all networks when the number of viewers reached an average of 5.69 million throughout the day.
ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS received 3.1 million, NBC received 2.94 million, MSNBC received 2.89 million, and CNN received 2.52 million viewers.
Great interest remained at the end of the hearing.
The main figure of Friday's drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning when protesters shouted at him while he was trying to take off the elevator to a hearing on the Court Committee.
CNN filmed it directly with down his eyes when it was floated by people.
“I am standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told: "You have power when so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would have something more to say at the hearing of the Court Committee.
Later, cable television and broadcast networks discussed live when the Judiciary Committee voted Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate.
However, Flake said that he would only do so knowing that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, the investigation of which was called for by the Democratic minority.
Flake, after talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partly persuaded.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice had power because it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" of "Brexit"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the newspaper of its plans to leave the European Union critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and seeking to undermine the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives on 29 September 2018 at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain.
In another interview published under her photo on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called "Brexit" plan for Šaški that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs and said it was "total absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting Police arrested suspect Dyeon Simpson on LSU player's death
Police arrested a person suspected of shootings that had ended in the death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge's police department reported that twenty-year-old Dyeon Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials posted a video of Sims and Simpson's clash, and police mentioned Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS affiliate WAFB reports that police have taken glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he shot Wayde to death.
The lawyer informs that his release bail is $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Expert Service released a preliminary report on Friday, mentioning that the cause of death was a shot in the head, deflected to the neck.
The department pays tribute to the Louisiana State Police Task Force of the fugitives, the state police crime laboratory, Southern University police and the residents of the district, who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the district law enforcement for "excellence and justice enforcement".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 metre tall guy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, the young man averaged 5.6 points during the game and caught 2.6 rebounding ball.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Willas Wade said that the team was "shocked" and "shocked".
"It's always thought about," said Wade.
The volcano spits ashes in Mexico City
Ash erupted from the Popocatepetl volcano, which reached the southern vicinity of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano when increased crater activity was recorded and gas and ash emissions recorded 183 times in 24 hours.
The center watched numerous thunders and quakes.
Photographs in social media show car windshields covered with a thin layer of ash in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Chochimilk.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters for independence clashed with riot police and when thousands joined opposing demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's opposition vote on secession.
The riot police, which stopped a group of masked separatists, were cast with eggs and powder paint, causing dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Police used the batons to end the fighting that started later in the day.
Within hours, the groups for independence, singing "Unforgettable, Unforgivable", encountered Unionist protesters who shouted: "Long live Spain!"
The local press reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is sung by Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
Most voters chose to become independent, but due to the overwhelmingly boycotting of those who did not want to secession, turnout was low.
According to Catalan authorities, as police across the region attempted to stop voting in polling districts last year, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes.
Independence-supporting groups established a camp on Friday night to prevent demonstrations supporting the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change the route.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician involved in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer certain of the prospect of Catalonia's independence.
“Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I watched parents shout joyfully able to vote, but we are now trapped," he said.
Despite a vital and difficult victory being ripped out in regional elections last December, the Catalan Independence Parties struggled to maintain momentum this year when many of their most well-known leaders retreated to voluntary exile or are detained and awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
Police supporter 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who filmed the protest on his phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is constantly growing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriolis Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders to be imprisoned in a pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidate in the elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and repression demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry — The men who entered the house by car
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after repeatedly driving into a house in Londonderry by car.
The incident occurred on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. (BVL) in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, a crossbow could also be fired at the car.
Menga's blow secured Livingston's 1:0 victory over Rangers
Livingston player Dolly Menga's first goal guaranteed victory
Livingston transferred to the upper league surprised Rangers by forcing Steven Gerrard, the Ibrox club manager, to lose the second of 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's blow proved very important because in a moment Gary Holt's team equalized with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team in this season of the Premier League remains unwound and will meet the leaders Hearts next Sunday, from which they are eight points behind.
Before that, on Thursday Rangers will play Europe League matches at home with Rapid Vienna.
At the time, Livingston extended its unbeaten series of unbeaten matches in the division to six, and head coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of losing, as Kenny Miller was replaced only last month.
Livingston misses his chances in matches with upright guests
Even before scoring a goal, Holt's team had to be in the front long ago due to its insistence on the Rangers' various problems.
At first, Scott Robinson broke through and hit across the gate, then Alan Lithgow was unable to reach Craig Halkett's head for the pass ball and this rolled off next to the gate.
The hosts did not worry when allowing Rangers to play in the front because they knew that they could make trouble for the guests by creating standard situations.
That's exactly how the deciding goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free blow and Livingston started to push ahead; Declan Gallagher and Robinson shared the ball with Menga, who, after stopping it, earned a goal from the middle of the penalty ground.
Since then, the ball has been controlled by Rangers, but the hosts' defence was insurmountable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no job.
Such a furrow game continued in the second quarter, although Kelly had to work to repel Alfredo Morelos' blow to the gate.
Scott Pittman's shot by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor was hit by his foot, and after another Livingston standard position, the ball sent by Lithgow was flying next to the gate.
The ball was constantly placed in the penalty court of Livingston, but every time the ball was kicked out, and two demands for a penalty kick – one due to Halkett's collision with Glenn Middleton, who ran in after the change, and the other due to the ball's touch hand – were not satisfied.
Analysis of the Phenomenal Performance of Livingston
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal Livingston game and result.
For all up to one they were great and continued to exceed expectations due to the increasingly improving gameplay.
The style of the game and the staff have hardly changed since returning to the top league, but it is appropriate to devote great merit to Holt as he lit the team upon arrival.
He was assisted by numerous heroes.
Captain Halkett played amazingly, focusing on a well-organized defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Worralla to stay awake.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they play well under Gerrard's guidance, this time they were far short of reaching their level.
They broke through the defenses of their hosts only once, with a certain alarm call to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was met in Cologne in various ways
On Saturday (29 September), there were smiles and blue skies when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to re-establish relations between NATO allies.
Leaders argued over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population community outside Turkey.
Police have banned 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for safety, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to meet him in their own country.
Different protests show a division of visitors: some German Turks regard him as a hero, while others flock him and call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford — A cyclist died when he collided with a car
A cyclist died in London when he collided with a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy Deptford Road, in the southeast of the city, at approximately 10.15 a.m. BVL.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics also arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, hit by the perpetrator, who then escaped, which occurred approximately 1.6 km from the crash on Saturday.
City police said officials were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
"Long Lartino" prison. Six officers injured in turmoil
The prison service reported that six prison officials were injured in a major upheaval in a prison of special security men.
The turmoil took place at HMP Long Lartin prison in Wustershire on Sunday around 9.30 a.m. in BVL, where it is still ongoing.
Special "Tornado" officials were called in to control this turmoil, which involves eight prisoners and takes place in one wing of the prison.
Officials are being treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison staff were called in order to control the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are assured that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will probably spend longer periods behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was being treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot suppression officers were called to prison to contain a serious turmoil during which some of the staff were hurled with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with its flash floods (the dry areas may benefit from this)
It is not common for a tropical depression to strike Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rosa with his remaining energy will stretch through the southwest of the desert and this will cause a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already announced that it is observing flash floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, spreading towards southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that when approaching with rain late Monday, Rosa will head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday.
In Phoenix, the National Meteorological Service noted that only “ten cyclones have maintained tropical storms or tropical depression status no more than 122 miles [322 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane no more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
Using the latest models of the National Hurricane Center, the pril is projected to be 5–10 centimeters of rainfall, and in some parts of Arizona's Mogolon Rim, rainfall is projected to be 5 centimeters.
Other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to reach between 2.5 and 5 centimetres, and in some places may drop up to 10 centimetres of rainfall.
For people who are not threatened by flash floods, the Rosa rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some may benefit from this rainfall as the southwest is currently suffering from droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from a very severe drought, and this corresponds to the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels towards the coast throughout the California Peninsula, belonging to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still equivalent to a hurricane category with a huge wind of 137 km/h, is 619 kilometers south of Cape Euchenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific region and is therefore raging.
So it is expected to reach the shore of Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday at lunchtime or in the evening.
Precipitation, which will fall out in certain parts of Mexico, can be severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
“From the California Peninsula to northwest Sonora, it is expected to reach 8–15 centimetres, but perhaps up to 25 centimetres of rainfall,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm, then reach the border of Arizona on Tuesday morning as early as a tropical depression, and head for south Utah on Tuesday late evening through Arizona.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its remnants is the very high amount of rain on the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center reported.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods, a stream of debris in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Assault at Midsamer in Norton — Four persons suspected of attempted murder have been arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were detained in an alleged assassination attempt after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsamer Norton in the Excelsior Terrace Zone, around 04.00 hours according to the BVL, on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and is now in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset police reported that a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area at night.
Officials have approached all individuals who may have any mobile phone footage of what happened.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "has suffered from the scumbags, anger of the Democratic Party".
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice by which we would like to reject the ruthless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in his speech in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "experienced the despicableness, anger of the Democratic Party" during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to the convention on Thursday strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing on his charges.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans saw on that day how cool, noble, and brave Kavanaugh was.
– The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, it is a lawyer with a reliable reputation in the field of public services," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while speaking about the importance of Republican electoral activity in the midterm elections.
"There are five weeks left until the most important elections in our lives.
I don't participate, although I actually do," he said.
– That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats were seeking "to resist and hinder".
Senior assistant GOP executives at CNN said the first most important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesia earthquake and tsunami continue to rise
Authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, with many being swept away due to giant waves crashing onto the beach when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at the Palu Beach Festival on Friday, when waves of six meters high began to hit the coast after dark. Many of them fatally choked and destroyed everything that happened on the road.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the BNPB Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency during an information report in Jakarta.
– The tsunami didn't come by itself, it brought back cars, logs, houses, it hit everything that was on the ground," said Nugroho and added that, before striking the coast, the tsunami was on the open sea at 800 km/h.
He said some people climbed the trees to avoid a tsunami and so survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos of the disaster agency showed that numerous buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were curved and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the seaside city continued to be shaken by repeated blows.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported that the energy released by the extremely strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times that of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
It was reported that the tsunami may have strengthened due to the geographical location of the city, as it is situated at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the buildings, later added that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
Nugroho said communications networks "were completely paralyzed, so no information was received" from Dongala.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," said a spokesman for the Red Cross in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers are going to areas affected by the disaster.
It was argued that "this could already be considered a tragedy, but the situation could get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized without reporting that the tsunami had struck Palu, although officials said the waves had come after issuing a warning.
A man on the upper floor of the building, who frantically shouts about an approaching tsunami for people standing on the street, can be heard in shared amateur social media material.
Within minutes, a wall of water strikes ashore, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power supply to be disrupted, resulting in the cut-off of communications networks around Palu, and difficulties for authorities to coordinate the provision of assistance.
Authorities have reported that troops from Jakarta and other cities have begun to send cargo aircraft with emergency supplies, but those evacuated by the person are still in great need of food and other essentials.
The city's airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed by October.
President Yoko Widodo scheduled a visit to the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesian tsunami casualties exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
Doseba reported that when World Vision personnel from Dongala traveled safely to Palu city, where employees were staying in tarpaulin tents built in the office yard, on the way were accompanied by devastated images.
"They told me that they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to take difficult action to provide disaster relief, some people complained that foreign aid workers with much experience were banned from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, provision and foreign personnel can only help when the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Ms Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
– When the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster", we can call for international assistance, but such status has not yet been announced."
A second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and loved ones of the missing people hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would affect the gloomy history of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been pinned under rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono had learned the two missing paragliders of the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"Because I am older in the field of paragliding sport, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon described in detail how within a few hours of announcing the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, this news traveled around the paragliding sports community. He sent messages desperately using the WhatsApp app to Palu's rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages contained only one gray, not two blue tickers.
"I think this means that messages have not been received," he said.
When completing the ATM, thieves stole $26,750 from the entertainment center "Newport on the Levee"
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling in an ATM at the entertainment center Newport on the Levee.
"The driver of the car was ready to add more money to the ATM in the entertainment complex," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another person "went behind the back of a Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for replenishment.
According to a press release, witnesses spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, but police were unable to determine the number of persons involved in the crime.
Any person with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police by telephone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. The rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
After announcing the changes on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A person formerly officially known as Kanye West".
41-year-old K. West has been called Ye for some time and named the eighth album by this name, which was released in June.
The changes started before the Saturday Night Live performance, where West was expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He has to replace singer Arian Grande in the show, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons," said the show's creator.
This is not only a shortening of the current professional name – Mr West said even earlier that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you", – this year he said this earlier when talking about the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, it means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and turned into just Ye, which means the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album more reflects who we are."
He is one of many well-known rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, Mr. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced preferring the Names of Love and Brotherly Love.
Former West colleague JAY-Z would also change his name and use it with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador (abbreviated by AMLO) promises not to use troops against civilians.
President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico promised never to use military forces against civilians as the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of students in the country approaches.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in "Tlatelolco" Square "never use military forces to tame the Mexican population".
On October 2, 1968, at a time when left-wing student movements began across Latin America, representatives of the military force fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, and 300 people were killed.
López Obrador solemnly promised to support young Mexicans by monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education opportunities involve young people in criminal groups.
US should double artificial intelligence funding
"As China becomes increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence specialist who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after reports of artificial intelligence were published by various bodies of the U.S. government, even the fact that there is no official artificial intelligence strategy in the U.S. in general.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan to take the lead in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the artificial intelligence research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and are waiting for another breakthrough in artificial intelligence," said Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major achievement of artificial intelligence will be in the US, as Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "Superpowers of Working Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in Face ++, one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, he worked with the artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later was the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's "Robotic Challenge", and asked when there would be another one to help find more insightful people.
Lee said that U.S. scientists often have to make hard efforts to win state grants.
"It's not China taking away academic leaders – it's companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen efforts due to artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically be offered green cards," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council announced its New Generation Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, Lee said China's National Natural Science Foundation is funding people in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are allocating money to U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month DARPA (English: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) announced an investment of $2 billion for the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, nothing has been done in the coming months about U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
Macedonians voted in a Sunday referendum whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, an act that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the province of Macedonia is located, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents claims to Greek territory and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on the proposed new name, but opponents nationalists say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether voter turnout would reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to take effect.
A referendum question was put on the voting card: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, is worth paying the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, the Macedonian youth, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have said they will follow the results of the vote and make them decisive.
It would take a two-thirds majority in parliament to change the name.
The state electoral commission reported that there were no reports of any violations by 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, the 62-year-old elector of the capital Skopje.
Macedonian parliamentarian Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško vote in a referendum held in Macedonia on changing the name of the country to open the way to joining NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of tents built by boycotting the referendum.
“We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads and not enter the door of the servants,” said Kavadarkov.
– We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and take part in the integration of Eurasia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, will attract much-needed investments.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his voice.
He said that the result "Yes" would be "the assurance of our future".
According to the results of a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, 30-43 percent of voters are expected to participate in the referendum – less than required voter turnout.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV “Telma”, 57 percent of respondents prepare to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote "Yes".
For a referendum to succeed, 50 percent of voters must participate plus one vote.
If the referendum failed, it would be the first serious failure of pro-Western government policy since it took power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero beats Brighton's entire defense and profit goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's defense, and the team Manchester City on Saturday, playing at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, achieved victory with a score of 2:0.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute, seemingly incredibly easy.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the square at the start of the attack.
Before he broke out into the open field, he passed among the three defenders of Brighton.
Aguero was then surrounded by four players wearing green shirts.
He slipped through one defender, having previously overtaken several others at the edge of the Brighton penalty court.
Then he passed the ball to the left where Sterling was.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero with one kick from the penalty ground and this right leg kicked the ball to the right side of the gate network, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has a problem with feet,” said City Manager Pepas Guardiola.
- We said that he would play for 55-60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We're lucky he scored a goal that moment."
Still, it was Sterling who helped Sky Blues first to advance in this Premier League match.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball during that attack while in the depth of the "Brighton" court.
Along the left edge of the square between the two opponents, he nicely handed the ball over to Leroy Sane.
Sane pushed the ball forward with several kicks while Sterling pushed towards the further breeze.
Sky Blues striker launched the ball into the gate just before slipping out of the square.
On Tuesday, at 12:55 a.m., City meets with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group match at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Zinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to play friendly matches with the Rockies
After the Nationals dropped out of the playoffs, there were no more valid reasons to re-force.
The competitive Scherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to remain in the playoffs; in the national league, the West is one point ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies, which beat the Nationals by a score of 5:2 on Friday evening, at least secured a chance to get a preferential trip, but will still have to try to secure the right to play in the first division.
“Although we are playing for nothing, at least we will be able to run out to the court knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where a crowd of people and another team will gather, will probably be at the highest level we can reach this year.
Why don't you try?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting composition of the Sunday match team, but in this case they are clearly inclined to release Scherzer.
Scherzer, for whom this match will be 34th in the barrel, made a pitching exercise on Thursday and would take the pitcher's position on his usual rest day – Sunday.
Washington right-handed statistics for this season: 18–7, 2.53 ERA and 300 rounds in 220 2/3 quarter.
Short giving a speech in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of Republican voter turnout in the mid-term elections, the President implicitly refers to the situation regarding Bretto Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have achieved will be placed on the scales in November.
There are five weeks left in our lives until perhaps the most important election.
It's very important, I'm not running... but I'm actually running, that's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Then he continued, "You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how angry it is.
They don't care what they hurt, through which they climbed to get power and control; that's what they really want — power and control, — but we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, have a mission "to resist and hinder".
"And you see it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, loathsome, low-minded and unjust people."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by mentioning the name of Democratic Senator Dianne's Feinstein, which caused huge ovation among the listeners.
“You remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, hm, like.
No, hm... no, I'm waiting for one — it was really poor body language — the worst body language of all I've ever seen."
Labour has lost its diversity of opinions.
They Do Not Admiss Those Who Speak Openly
When ‘Momentum' activists voted in my local party to distrust me, I don't think it was surprising.
Finally, I am the latest of the Labour parliamentarians who have been told that I am unwelcome – and that is for their opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, received similar threats because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed in criticising me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, on similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want many members to join the meetings and that the meetings would be productive."
For most of those eight years when I am a local Labour Party parliamentarian, Friday evening GC meetings were exactly that.
Sadly, the tone of many meetings today is not so much and the promises of a "softer, more pleasant" policy have long been forgotten, even if they have ever started.
It is increasingly evident that a different opinion in the Labour Party is not tolerated and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues, whom I believed to be alike, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and hold opinions that I would never agree with, whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what – a tyrant of insults on social media that encourages my cancellation condemns the centre's policy and says that I don't belong in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I was much more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to withstand an avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things of this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the same party, and with every "non-trust" procedure or change in the electoral system, this party is becoming increasingly inferior.
Over the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to keep from jumping out, not talking so loud, and then "everything will be fine" with me.
But I didn't come to politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a schoolboy, provoked by thatcher's government neglect, which in the true sense of the word led to the collapse of my entire school class, I have sought to win better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I have never concealed my policies, including the recent elections.
No one at Nottingham East should have been surprised by my political opinions and areas of disagreement with the current leaders.
To those who encouraged this procedure on Friday, I can say that when the country digs towards Brexit, which will be affected by households, businesses and public services, I do not realize the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, one message I have for Nottingham's Momentum is addressed to my constituents, Labour Party members (or not): I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of cancellation or political expediency will stop me from acting according to my beliefs and all your best interests.

"Ayr"- "Melrose" – 38:17 Invincible "Ayr" conquers the tops of the tables
Two late attempts slightly distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved this moment of triumph in the impressive, promising game of the day of Tennent's Premiership.
The team now ended up at the top of the table – the only one undefeated.
Finally, the victory was brought to them by impeccable defense and well-exploited opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We have raised all the tests during all the matches that have been held so far, and we are still undefeated, so I am really happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Ayr has done well, players have used up their chances better than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was successfully completed by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr forward, but the yellow card to Scots Rory Hughes, which was released by Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect figures, and Baggot stopped the inefficient attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage by a fine when he scored and successfully completed a personal attempt before the middle of the competition, helping Ayr to break off with a score of 17:5 before the break.
However, Melrose started the second quarter well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was successfully completed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
The match was suspended for a longer time because Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was transported from the ground on the stretcher. After the extended match, Ayr continued to push forward when Stafford McDowall's attempt was successfully completed by Clim.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose tried to take advantage of the players' surplus, but Bruce Colvine's attempt at the end of the fierce pressure was counterproductive.
The home team player returned, however, after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Clim without the ball, MacPherson pinned the ball from the penalty line behind the spot of the continuing "Ayr" struggle.
Clim's scored ended his attempt, as he had already done almost from the start of the game's restart, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's kick to the corner of the square and prevented Country striker Gregor Henry from holding a fifth home team attempt to score.
Still Game star seems ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
"Still Game" star Ford Kiernan seems ready to move into the accommodation and catering sector, when it turns out that he was appointed director of the licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, writes the script and plays alongside his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last season of this show, and Kiernan seems to be already planning his life after Kraiglang.
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although Scottish Sun sources hinted that Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's "blessing restaurant business".
"We own the sea": Bolivia, imprisoned on land, expects the court to reopen its path to the ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The ocean blue flag floats on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the slogan: “We rightly belong to the sea.
It is our duty to regain it."
All over land imprisoned Bolivia is still alive memories of access to the ocean, which had to be sacrificed to Chile in the 19th century bloody conflict over resources,—a living and longing to once again brow in the Pacific Ocean.
The hopes that have been built up in recent decades have now been greatly strengthened, as, after five years of reflection, Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice to be issued on 1 October.
"Bolivia is united in the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes positive results," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will monitor the publication of the TTT's decision on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will make a positive decision on Bolivia's complaint—Chile will be obliged to negotiate access to the sea to the Bolivian state.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, an Indian who is facing a controversial electoral struggle for re-election, is also very interested in the outcome of Monday's decision.
"We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific," he promised towards the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to believe that the court is unlikely to make a ruling in favor of Bolivia — even if it did, little would change.
A UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to strip Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the TTT's decision will be published only six months after the last arguments have been heard hardly suggests that the case "was not difficult," said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
And even if Bolivia managed to make some progress, the last four years could knock it back.
"This issue of access to the sea has been raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She believes that any remnants of Chilean goodwill have been destroyed by the vengeful rhetoric of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation sometime, but after all this it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision was made unusually quickly.
"On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start an era of new relations with Chile and end the disputes that have continued for 139 years for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, and uses the sea issue as a political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never deny the right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to come to terms with the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho assures him that his nation will never abandon nuclear weapons first if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises, which rival country leaders agreed on during a meeting in Singapore.
His comments were made at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to have intended to resume stranded nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after meeting Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says that the "utopian dream" is that by continuing the sanctions and by the US abandoning the declaration on the end of the Korean War, North Korea could ever be brought down.
Washington avoids accepting the declaration unless Pyongyang first makes convincing disarmament action.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But the widespread skeptical notion that Pyongyang does not seriously intend to abandon the arsenal, which the country seems to see as the only guarantee of its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headgear, and they will soon conquer the nearest fashionable stores
If you want to replenish your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is just for you.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentrically large headgear in their spring and summer 2019 collections, and he simply stunned the viewers of Paris Fashion Week in his style.
These extremely impractical hats conquered the social network Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching works on the podium.
Valentine’s outstanding work was a huge body - colored hat decorated with a wide featherlike edge that envelops the mannequin’s head.
Other non-standard size accessories were jewel-tipped watermelons, a wizard's hat and even pineapple – but they are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks were sewn up with lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One of the pieces looked like a diver's suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, while the other resembled a melted ice cream nozzle.
And if you follow this trend of giant-sized fashion – you won't shoot.
Steele's experts suggest that these huge covers can enter stores.
Huge hats became popular with La Bomba high heels, straw hats with two foot edges were already worn by everyone – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created extremely impractical hats that conquered all social networks, released another huge piece on the podium – a straw beach basket, almost the same size as the mannequin wearing it in a swimsuit.
The red brick Rafia basket, decorated with rafia fringes and a white leather handle, became an outstanding highlight of Jacquemus' collection "La Riviera SS19" at Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a celebrity stylist, said to FEMAIL: “I think that next summer a huge hat and beach bags will come to the shops, because the designer has had such a great impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard size accessories.”
John Edward: "Language competence is a key skill for the citizens of the world"
Scotland's independent schools improved academic achievement records by not setting down both in 2018 and once again demonstrated outstanding exam results, which were only further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other community merits.
When there are a total of more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide their students and their parents with the highest possible level of services.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and to be citizens of the world.
Working in the education sector, which can design and implement the school curriculum, we can see that modern languages continue to be popular and choose them willingly in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you are able to speak to a person in a language he understands, he will understand you with his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and build trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of this year's recent exams we can say that languages flaunt at the peak of popularity and have the best maintenance ratings in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied a foreign language received the highest A rating.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A rating during the Mandarin Language Examination, 72 percent of those who learned German received the highest A rating, as well as 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider the knowledge of foreign languages to be an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, as an optional subject, are now considered as important in independent school programs and elsewhere as basic subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
According to a survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons for employers' difficulties in filling jobs were lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly becoming mandatory so that young people are prepared for their future career.
As future access to employment will depend to a large extent on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses, his or her second language will in future be far superior to others if he or she has these lifelong skills.
By being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person learning several languages will be much more competitive.
According to a 2013 survey conducted by YouGov, involving more than 4 000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to take part in the interview, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for children of the present.
Learning several languages, especially in developing countries, will improve children’s chances of meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school varies according to the languages it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to the UK, looking to the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be many languages from which you can choose an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are ready to create a training environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills they need to live in the future.
There is no denying that languages remain vital for the future of the country in today's global business environment, and this must also be reflected in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and results for Scottish youth.
This must be done.

LeBron will start his debut for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
There is not much waiting for the fans to see LeBron James start the season with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that James would play in the opening competition of the Sunday season with the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the exact number of minutes to play is not yet clear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudellas said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week James was asked about the plans in the Lakers team during six pre-season games.
"At this stage of my career, I no longer need pre-season matches to get ready," he said.
Trump's speech in West Virginia, on YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins his campaign in Willing, West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of Trump's five planned speeches next week, including pauses in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In a vote approving the procedure for the suspension of the nomination of his chosen Supreme Court candidate, Trump seeks to mobilize support in the upcoming midterm election of the term, as Republicans were threatened with losing control in the November vote in Congress.
What time will Trump's speech take place in West Virginia this evening, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's speech in Willing, West Virginia, scheduled at 7 pm Eastern Time in the evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online on YouTube, which is shown below.
The short will likely touch on the subject of this week's Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, as it has sown a lot of tension over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior when the Senate voted to suspend the nomination of a candidate for up to a week while the FBI is conducting an investigation.
But the most important goal of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength in the run-up to the November elections.
Therefore, representatives of President Trump's campaign say that the goal of these five meetings next week, as announced by Reuters, is to "energize volunteers and supporters in Republicans' efforts to defend and expand the majority held by the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Control of the Congress is so important on its agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible because the campaign season is beginning very hot," said Trump's campaign spokesman who did not want to reveal his name.
"The speech planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsbergh media," says West Virginia's Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016 for the second time in the past month.
Trump tries to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is in the lowlands of the ratings according to the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to the top of his ratings," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
"Ryder" Cup 2018 tournament: U.S. team is militant and hopes to qualify for Sunday unit competition
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the fours can be just what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a swing of success is entirely fanciful, but the players really believe it, especially in competitions like this one.
So on whose side is success now?
"They took the lead by six points and now by four, so I guess we can consider it a bit of a success," said Jordan Spieth in preparation for the day.
Of course, Europe is leading, it has a four-point lead, and it still has twelve matches ahead of it.
American enthusiasm, according to Spieth, faded, and they do not lack it, let alone the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was impenetrable from beginning to end and took an impeccable lead.
As the round continued, those wild win screams were getting famous. In order to end the fourth match with a draw, Thomas scored two out of two possible points.
His blow, which earned them a victory in this match at the 15th pit, was escorted by similar cheers, which sort of said the American team was not yet threatened by the end.
"We just have to focus and take care of our matches," Spietas said.
Now each of these players remained to be played separately.
By the successful end – 18 wells.
The only players to score more than Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe scored four points out of four possible and can be calm.
Moliwood was the only couple who didn't need any extra blows not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
That course of events and the reaction of the raging spectators only confirm that they will be the players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinar, who, when the last rays of the setting sun hit the Le Golf National field, have a chance to secure Europe's victory.
It would be good if the two would succeed in different pits at the same time.
Although it is too early to talk about Europe's glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played briefly with Sergio Garcia, the eastern four-ball hero when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two double extra strokes during the series of the first nine pits pushed the Spaniard and the Swede into trouble, from which they never managed to get out.
However, no one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four-ball and four-ball games are so interesting to watch for interactions between couples, for advice they give and don't give, and for the fact that strategy can change instantly.
Europe played better as a team, so decisively leading came to the finals, but this four-stage also showed that the U.S. team has a fighter spine that some, especially in the states, doubted.
On the last day of the "Ryder" Cup, Europe leads 10:6
Europe will meet on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a weighty leverage, leading the lead against the United States by 10:6 after Saturday's four round.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario continued to heat the atmosphere by winning two victories over the hard-fighting Tiger Woods and took the lead at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in order to save the trophy that Hazeltine had lost two years earlier, dominated the morning four games against the unsuccessfully playing American side and finished the stage with a score of 3:1.
The U.S. demonstrated more resistance in the fours when it won two games but was unable to overcome the scoring leverage
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12-unit match to be held on Sunday to keep the trophy in his hands.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row when he and Molinari dubbed Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they flawlessly smashed trust lost Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even better score at 5:4.
Woods, who had otherwise not done so in two Saturday games, showed a high level of professionalism at some points, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his games in the fours, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose rested in the morning fours and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the fours; they beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk in the world rankings in first and third place by a score of 2:1.
Despite a pleasant, mild breeze on a day in the southwestern part of Paris, Europe did not go as far as butter.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raised a cartel for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
In a four-ball match, they won an uneasy victory with a score of 2:1 against John Rahma and Ian Poulter of Spain, and in a four-ball match they beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by a score of 4:3, without scoring the ball in the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the "Ryder" Cup the team managed to win the four-point lead by going to single games, although Furyko's side would need a draw to keep the trophy.
Although in second place for two days, success seemed to have turned away from them on Sunday.
North Korea says it will by no means disarm unilaterally, unable to trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that continuing sanctions deepen their distrust of the United States and that in such circumstances the country will certainly not unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea has taken "significant measures of goodwill" in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile testing, dismantling a nuclear test base and committing itself to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not get a similar response from the US side," he regretted.
"Without any confidence in the US, we will not be able to trust our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm."
While Ri repeated North Korea's already heard complaints of Washington's opposition to a staged approach to nuclear disarmament, whereby North Korea would be rewarded in its steps of action, his statement stood out by the fact that he had not completely ruled out the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang used to do before.
Ri alluded to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to work on the "armament of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950–1953 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refuses to relax severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. demands nuclear disarmament first and increases pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal through forced methods, even abandoning the declaration on the end of the war," said Ri.
“To think that sanctions can bring us down is the same as for people who do not care about us, to pursue utopian dreams.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, highlighted by the U.S. leader at the United Nations a little earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months: "If the other country on this issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea rather than the US, the issue of nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have gone into such a deadlock."
However, the tone of Ri's speech changed dramatically compared to last year when he told the UN General Assembly that when "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile gentleman" on a suicide mission, directing North Korean missiles to the US was absolutely inevitable.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, bragged praise to Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea meets the requirements of nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia said that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pomeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "Secure Council sanctions must proceed decisively without making any concessions until complete final evidence-confirmed nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council has unanimously approved sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the backstage of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to purify the ground for the next meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the latter trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that all progress was just for North Korea to announce a few hours later that he had made "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim said that those "appropriate measures" he sought were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and a shift to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning enough to rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all their students to sleep more to fight the growing match culture in the studios, using caffeine and not sleeping at night
One academic found that students at the best university in the world often do not even have basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigam City, a specialist in Women's Hospitals, developed a course that he said was the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the speech, one girl came up to me and said: "Why is it that I am told about this only now, in the final year of my studies?"
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep habits help to achieve academic and sporting results and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services department, said that the university had decided to offer this course at a time when it became clear that the students were severely sleep deficient during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section contains a picture of the dormitory room where students can click on a coffee cup, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how sleep deprivation affects sports performance and how important a going to sleep routine is.
In the following section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of infarction, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Student campus map with interactive icons that encourage participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We understand that this will not change the behaviour of students at once.
But we think they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health consequences when you choose to smoke", explained Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to stay awake overnight, according to him, still exists. Modern technology and increasing pressure on students led to the growing problem of sleep deprivation.
"To ensure that enough and quality sleep has been done, there should be students' secret weapon to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, gue he said, "even avoiding gaining weight because sleep deprivation shifts the brain into starving mode, making students feel hungry constantly."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler train the course when he attended one of the subjects he taught last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course available to the entire student campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all postgraduate students to attend this course before attending this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm clock when it's time to go to bed, just as lifting, and guard against the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and LED lighting, because they can knock your circadian rhythm out of balance, so it can be difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset Gerrard's men
The Rangers experienced another disappointment when Dolly Menga in Livingstone managed to overcome Steven Gerrard's weakened score of 1:0.
Ibrox expected to earn its first victory on the trip after the triumph of February with a score of 4:1 "St Johnstone", but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games in the position of manager and now the latter's team is already eight points behind the leaders of the next run premiership league "Hearts".
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration, the Rangers played no chance to equalize the score.
Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston rose to third and only one goal behind Hibernian.
And Rangers' concerns do not stop because it is likely that the butter from the triplets hit and injured the side judge Calum Spence.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed him to overtake Ayr and led him to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt trusted the same monk who took the point from Hearts last week, and he would have liked how his well-thought-out combinations chained opponents at every step.
Rangers dominated by controlling the ball, but having it, Livingston did more.
They could score as early as the second minute when Menga handed the ball towards Allan McGregor's gate to the breaking Scott Pittman by a close blow, but the guard destroyed his chance of diverting the ball away from the gate.
After a distant freestroke by Keaghan Jacobs, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner defender Alan Lithgow pleaded by.
Rangers took control, but the last third of the match was only hopeful, not faith in their game.
With 15 minutes left, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty when he faced Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dropped his complaints to Colombian.
Rangers managed to hit only twice in the first quarter, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly frightened by Lassana Coulibaly's headstroke or gentle paridenim of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livy's 34th minute goal may not have matched the course of the match, no one will argue that they deserved it for their efforts.
Rangers once again failed to overcome Jacobs' viscous defense.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who retained his temper and handed Menga over to easy completion.
During the break, Gerrard took action to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and that change almost immediately bore fruit when the national guard played Morelos, but an impressively played Kelly ran away retook the blow.
Livingston included guests in the game they liked – with distant transmissions of Lithgowo and Halkett's ball.
Holt's team could increase their leverage at the end, but McGregor defended himself against Jacobs' blow after Lithgowas filing from a corner.
At the end of the match, Glenn Middleton, the Rangers player who went to the field after the change, once again appealed for a penalty kick after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: on September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years ago and MORE... The future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born in Germany that day.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that later led to the development of a device known as Geiger counter.
Since then, this device has become a hit of the world of science, and later a hit of popular culture, when in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, not particularly reminiscent of cowboy scientists Roy·us Rogers and Dale·as Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the atoms in the radioactive effects in the minerals."
Evans: "Hey, it's really shooting now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that received his name continues to exist.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells and kill them
The vaccine helps the immune system to recognise bad cells – this is part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory
The cells can then "see" the proteins specific to many cancers, and are re-injected
The trial vaccine has produced promising results in the treatment of patients with various cancers.
One woman who received this vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells, has lost more than 18 months of ovarian cancer.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory, then the cells can see proteins specific to HER2 type cancers, and are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
"HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and rectum", explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, whereby immune cells are extracted from patients and learned to target cancer cells, has been successfully applied in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanyeșas West released Trump's supporting tirade, wearing a MAGA cap, after his performance on the SNL show.
It didn't end well
After an incoherent performance at Saturday Night Live, audiences shamed Kanye West, who praised US President Donald Trump, for taking part in the 2020 campaign.
After performing the third song "Ghost Town" that evening, during which he wore a cap with the inscription "Make America Great", he continued to condemn the Democrats and expressed his support for Trump.
"How many times have I had to talk to white people, they would say, "How can you like Trump, for he is a racist?"
Well, if racism were a problem for me, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL show began with a comic scene in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of inappropriate sexual behavior presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this was not broadcast, the footage with West's replicas was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock tried to mock West with this record.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the scenes because of his headgear.
“They mocked me backstage.
He said not to go in there with a hat like that.
They mocked me!
They said I reached the bottom", he comforted Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see what the bottom is? ” he asked. “I am wearing my superman hat, and that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to exist?
Begin to love."
His speeches at least twice aroused dissent in the audience and the members of the SNL broadcast seemed embarrassed, according to the report by Variety. One person told the media: "The whole studio was filled with deadly silence."
West was invited to urgently replace singer Arian Grande, as her ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West puzzled many with his performance, during which he performed the song "I Love It", wearing the "Perrier" bottle suit.
He received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who posted a record on Twitter: "To one of the bravest people in the spirit: Thank you for CROSSING THE MINIANS."
But the talk show's host Karen Hunter posted on Twitter a record that West was simply "self-being and it's amazing."
"But I choose to NEREMTI a person (by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his "art"), whose beliefs are a poisonous ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we're also free," she added.
Before the show began, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first creator to change his name, but he has followed the same path already passed by Diddy, also known by the names Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was originally called Snoop Lyon; the music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later became known by the name Prince.

A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder when a man was injured with a knife in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
According to police, this incident occurred in Balihakamore.
The accused is expected to stand before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Star of the Throne Wars Another Harrington criticizes a distorted view of masculinity
Another Harrington became famous as the sword-smoothing character John Snow in the HBO fantastic adventure series on the Middle Ages "The Throne Wars".
But a 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of the match hero, who says that such roles on-screen often make young boys feel as if they had to be tough to be respected.
Speaking at Sunday Times Culture, Another said that he thought "something was wrong", and asked how to fight the problem of distorted masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old colleague star of the Throne Wars, admitted that this topic "touches him strongly".
“I feel that I am strongly touched by this topic now. Where have we made the mistake of developing manhood?" he asked.
"What are we teaching growing men that we are facing such problems?"
Another believes that due in part to this wave of distorted masculinity, television could be responsible because it creates very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, but what is learned?
What is taught on television or on the street that young people believe that they should have this type of masculinity?
I think this is one of the important issues of our time – how do we change this?
Obviously we made a mistake with young men somewhere."
In an interview he also confirmed that he would not participate in any prehistory or continuation of the Throne Wars, when the series would end next summer, and said that "he already has enough battlefields and horses".
From November the next film will be in Sam Shepard's True West contemporary version. It is a film about the film director and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him when he was creating "The Wars of Thrones", – he met his wife Rose there.
"In this series I met my wife, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life", he said.
In the Emmy award-winning fantastic series Rose played Igrite, the love object of another character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 in Leslie family-owned property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports increase in new cases of disease 14%
China reports an increase of 14% in citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 people have been infected with the infection in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most newly infected people have been transmitted infection by sex, and this is different from past statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But so the number of people infected with HIV has fallen to almost zero, as pointed out by the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
Over time, however, the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a sensitive issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized as early as 1997, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is widespread.
Since conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually marry women.
The majority of cases of infection with the disease are due to inadequate protective measures during such sexual relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as one way to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that workers leaked Republican senator data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied the allegations on Saturday that one of its employees had published personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the pages of Wikipedia.
A Los Angeles Democrat argued that the charges were made by ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and once again despicable lies," said Waters on his Twitter account.
The disclosure reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mikeșo Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill at a time when the Senate was investigating charges of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leaked information appeared some time later when these three senators asked questions to Kavanaugh.
"On Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, it was reported that the IP address from which the source of these records related to the Waters office was identified and information from a member of Waters' staff was disclosed," reported from the Capitol.
"These unfounded allegations are completely false and absolute lies," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have suffered as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unsubstantiated allegations are entirely false and absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds mean", Fleischer wrote.
“It says that she does not have enough self-control to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of things he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't defend himself.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He should be calm and humble."
Fleischer seems to have tried to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of having seemed too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is involved in the midterm election campaign to replace Waters, also made his thoughts on Twitter.
"Truth, if not a lie," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement bodies on these false accusations.
‘We will ensure that the organisers are made aware of the fact that they have continued to be legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees without exception.’
Review of the comedy Johnny English strikes again – exhaled spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
The same thing seems to be true of the revival of the action spy comedy franchise "Jonis Inglišas" – "Jonis Inglišas" started to appear in 2003, and in 2011 it returned to the screens with the comedy "Jonis Inglišas Resurrection".
Is this sarcastic autosatisfaction about how blatantly screwed up we will become a new opportunity for national exports?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has a second chance to bring unpleasant truths to the surface with his wide eyes and rubber face.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, although claiming luxury, also acquired some of Inspector Clouseau's qualities, some of Mr. Bean's features and a little bit of a slick resemblance to that guy, a hint of which was used to create the theme of the drama "Carriages of Fire" used during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also based somewhat on the character about the traveler and the mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
There are a few beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the blade rotor struck his helmet.
Atkinson's comedic talent is obvious, but the humour itself seems exhaled and strangely excessive, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and "Mission impossible" boldly insert comedy elements as well.
Humor is as if it were more for children than for adults, and Johnny Inglish's unexpected adventures don't seem as ingenious and as peaceful as Atkinson's quiet jokes playing Mr. Bean.
The most common topic at this time is that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker successfully broke into Britain's ultra-secret spy web network and revealed the identities of all British spies in the area, causing the agent's outrage – an overly insignificant role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop to the cup of the Prime Minister, a pompous and cornered character who already suffers from crushing political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of the character portraying Teresa May squeezes out everything he can, but in the scenario good material for that little.
Wise counselors inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people among those who have retired.
This means that we will have to approach Johnny English, who currently works as a school principal in some fancy institution but provides illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. There were some good jokes when English offered a school of Rock spy academy.
English is sent back to Whitehol to discuss the state of emergency and there meets his longtime overall Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man associated with a submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays a maiden of the nobility, seems to be underexploited in talent.
So Batman and Robin, who are able to mess up all the matters in Her Majesty's secret service, take action again and meet the fatal beautiful Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
A charismatic billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problem, i.e. malicious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, is dangerously turning his head on the Prime Minister.
English and Bough begin their own odyssey: dressing up as waiters, they cause a fire in a French restaurant, cause chaos in the luxurious Volta yacht and English begins a complete anarchy in an attempt to use the headphones of virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All stopcades were clearly keeping up with this last series, but no matter how pleasant or wild it is, all this much resembles children's television.
Pretty mediocre.
As with other Johnny Inglish films, I couldn't get rid of the thought: isn't the British film industry able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really be worthy of his talent?
The Labour Party denies creating a plan for the British for working four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week but to pay for five days.
The party reportedly wants company executives to share the savings accumulated as a result of the artificial intelligence (DI) revolution, giving its employees one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend and bring home the same pay.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to steer the country's development towards workers.
The move towards a four-day week of work has also been welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
One of the high-ranking Labour party's sources, The Sunday Times, said: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also promised during the four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this idea is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "Four days' week is not party politics and this is not discussed in the party."
Shadow government spokesman John McDonnell took the opportunity to present his vision for a socialist revolution in economics at last week's Labour Party conference.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from "faceless dictators" and "profit hunters" in utilities.
Such plans by the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their share because, after seeing the wrong done, the Labour government can deduct something.
He also approved plans to include employees in the company's board and to create incorporated equity funds to transfer 10 per cent of the capital of private sector companies to employees, and they could receive up to GBP 500 of annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the '60 Minutes' question as to whether an FBI investigation into Mr Kavanaugh could change their mind
In the FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a final vote was postponed for at least a week on whether to appoint him to the Supreme Court, so the question arises as to whether the facts clarified by the Bureau of Investigation could affect the opinion of any Republican senators in a way that they would no longer support this judge.
On Sunday, the correspondent for the interview show 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley, asks Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could happen that the FBI will find out something that will change their opinion.
Senator Kennedy seems to be taking a looser approach than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Well, yes, of course," Mr Kennedy replies.
"As I said at the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, when these charges appeared, I called him and asked him, "Did you do that?"
He answered decisively, firmly, unambiguously."
So Mr Graham's opinion would seem to be unchanged.
"I have decided on Bretto Kavanaugh, it would be really shocking accusations," he says.
"On Dr. Ford – I don't know what it was, but I know one: Brett categorically denies it," added L. Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"No one in her name can confirm this.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything new will turn out."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it contributed in any way to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars, with the equally impressive goal of eradicating poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in the Grand meadow of Central Park, the World Citizens' Festival will meet tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread more widely the message about the real goal of the event – to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival was launched in 2012. It is a follow-up to the Global Anti-Poverty Project, an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), visitors to the concert had to perform a variety of tasks or actions, such as engaging in volunteering activities, sending an email to the world leader, calling by phone, or any other meaningful help to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But are the citizens of the world successful in achieving this goal?
Will the idea to reward people with a free concert really convince them to demand and urge them to act? Maybe this is just another example of so-called cliactivism, bogus activism – people think that they will really change the situation by signing an online petition or posting an entry on Twitter.
According to the organizers of the World Citizens' Festival, since 2011, the movement has registered more than 19 million actions of its supporters, which promote a wide range of goals.
They say that under pressure from these actions, world leaders have announced $37 billion in commitments and policy strategies to change the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group identified 390 commitments and statements prompted by the group's actions, from which at least $10 billion of funds have already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that almost 649 million people worldwide are already directly affected by the guaranteed funds.
Some key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based partnership of investors and enforcers that "help children grow up and reveal their full potential". After receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages, it has promised to give Rwanda US dollars to help solve the country's food poverty.
"Having the support of the UK government, supporters, national governments and such as you, citizens of the World, we can make social injustices such as nutrition insufficiency a past," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Nutrition Power to the crowd gathered at the concert in London in April 2018.
This group also indicated that after receiving 5,000 appeals calling for improved nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the "Dietary Power" project, which will bring nutrition interventions to 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on your website, which asks: "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?",
The world’s citizens respond: “This is a long and difficult road, and we will sometimes stumble and fail.
However, like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the performers taking part in this year’s event in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will lead the event.
According to the Home Secretary, the U.S. may use the fleet to block the export of Russian energy
"If necessary, Washington can use the fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, as well as Middle East markets," says U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, as the Washington Examiner says.
Mr Zinke argues that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext used to explore new energy markets.
"I think that Russia is interfering in the Middle East because it wants to regulate energy, just as it is doing in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," Mr Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States can do this by means of the fleet, it can make the maritime routes open and, if necessary, it can carry out a blockade, it can make sure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Mr Zinke said this to those who took part in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself the U.S. "voice of energy consumers".
He went on to compare Washington's methods with those applied to dealing with issues concerning Russia and Iran, and noted that they were essentially the same.
"Iran's and Russia's economic alternative is to find a larger or smaller counterweight to replace fuel," he said and also called Russia a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements appeared as part of the Trump administration's mission to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia on the market offering European consumers a much cheaper opportunity.
Therefore, D. Trump's administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the supposedly inadequate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Mr Trump, made Berlin a captive of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, the reason for Washington's fierce opposition to this project is only economic, and it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position received a hostile reaction from Germany, and it reaffirmed its determination to continue with this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I certainly do not agree with the interference of the third state in our energy supply affairs," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider nominating her candidacy during the 2020 presidential election
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider the presidential nomination after the term midterm election.
During a meeting at Holjok City Hall in Massachusetts, Mrs Warren confirmed she would consider a candidate.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to manage our failed government, they have to go to the top office as well," she said at the town hall.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to take part in the presidential election."
During a meeting at City Hall, Mr Warren reprimanded President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am terrified by the way Donald Trump treats our democracy," she said.
Mr Warren openly criticizes Mr Trump and his proposed Supreme Court candidate, Brettas Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter message released on Friday, Mr Warren says that "an FBI investigation clearly needs to be carried out before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that most voters in the state of Mrs Warren herself believe that she should not stand for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk's political research center and Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of expected voters in Massachusetts say that a senator should not participate in elections.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick receives more support, with 38 percent supporting his possible candidacy, and 48 percent opposing.
Other names discussed for possible candidacy in 2020 by prominent Democratic Party representatives include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Mr Biden says he will make a formal decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
At Donald Trump's gathering, Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic disorder
Track Palin, aged 26, who entered military service in September, spent a year in Iraq.
In a domestic violence incident on Monday night, he was arrested and indicted.
"I see what my son is going through, what he is going through when he goes back to everyday life, so I understand other families who are feeling the consequences of a post-traumatic disorder, and some of the wounds of our soldiers that they are returning with," she told the audience at Donald Trump's gathering in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the truth. She said that the son and other veterans of the war "are coming back a little bit changed, they are coming back a tougher heart, they are coming back doubting whether they will get respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have given to their country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and an attack on a woman, as well as charges of obstructing the reporting of domestic violence with a gun and the presence of alcohol, as reported by Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Vasila Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support opposition to new asylum seekers' policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, 18 states and the district made comments to the amicus curiae (court counsel) to support the challenge of asylum seekers' policies, reports NBC News.
The applicant’s full name is not disclosed in the Grace v Sessions proceedings, which the American Civil Liberties Union launched against federal policy.
She says her partner "and members of his criminal gang" were violent against her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which the U.S. receives many asylum applications as states, plagued by persistent problems of gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the Immigration Appeal Council's 2014 decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine stated in a report on Friday that the new policy "despite decades of existing state, federal, and international laws."
"Federal laws require decisions on asylum applications to be made taking into account the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates this principle," says the amicus curiae remark.
In this remark, lawyers also argue that policies prohibiting immigrants from entering the country harm the US economy, and that immigrants are more likely to do business and "provide the necessary labour services".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June instructed judges dealing with immigration to no longer provide asylum to those fleeing domestic violence and victims of gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or certain political views," said J. Sessions in a June 11 political report.
The asylum granted has never sought to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Twice the death toll in Palu is desperately searched for the rest of the living
The situation of the survivors is steadily deteriorating.
"The tension is very high," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, calming her feverish baby son in the evacuation center of the city of Palu.
“The fast continues to carry more and more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water."
Residents have been observed returning to their destroyed homes, collecting stuff overstretched with water, and trying to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and damaged 7.5 magnitude earthquake hospitals are packed.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Harris, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, are placed outside at the Palu Army Hospital – continuing with strong repeated hits, hospital patients are treated outdoors.
His eyes become filled with tears when he relates how he felt a severe earthquake in the hotel's fifth floor room, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save others.
It seems to me that I broke through the ruins of the wall," said D.Haris to the Associated Press and added that he came to the city with his family to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, hereinafter “silence”.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're healthy."
US ambassador accuses China of intimidating propaganda advertising
A week later, when an official Chinese newspaper circulated a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper, extolling the mutual benefits of the U.S.-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned a supplement to the best-selling newspaper Des Moines Register in the state of Iowa paid by China Daily and accused China of influencing the U.S. congressional elections on November 6.
"D. Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the U.S. elections marks a new milestone in Washington's growing campaign to exert pressure on China," U.S. officials told Reuters agency.
While it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war, and the two countries are wrestling with tariffs for importing each other's goods.
According to Chinese and US experts, Chinese counter-tariffs were targeted at exporters in Iowa and similar states that supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad – U.S. Ambassador to China, former long-term governor of Iowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural produce to China – said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
On Sunday, in an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register, T. Branstad said that China "extremely bullied itself with printing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese authorities took advantage of the respectable freedom of speech and the press in America and ordered a paid advertising message "Des Moines Register," wrote T.Branstad.
"In the meantime, in the local Beijing press kiosk, you will not find conflicting voices and will not create a real picture reflecting the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic trajectory because the press is under the hard pad of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
Branstad also added that "one of China's most well-known newspapers got away with the offer to print" his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: As mid-election nears, Kavanaugh fiasco discouraged Republican voters
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has even been indicted for several counts of sexual harassment, the analyst warned that this would result in a negative response in the upcoming midterm election, especially from women.
The emotions raised by the situation are extremely strong, and many Republicans already officially claim to wish to conduct the vote.
Such things cannot be taken back later," said Grant Reeher, professor at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Mr Reeher said he had doubts whether the last-minute calls by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to launch an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will remember it both tomorrow and in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national representative of the progressive group "MoveOn" on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted: "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the senate lobby, when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, kzip reported to Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will come across,” said Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst for the news site.
- People say she was already strong, and they're right.
But it could further strengthen positions, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters aged between 18 and 29, who, although disliked by the president, often simply do not vote."
Even before Mr Ford publicly gave evidence when she detailed the charges of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that if Republicans confirmed the candidacy, this could lead to outrage.
"It caused a lot of confusion for the Republican Party," stated former Chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the committee vote or the final vote, not only about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed a judge, but also about how the Republicans managed this situation and how they treated Ch. B. Ford," Guy Cecil said to the news channel, the director of Priority USA – a group assisting Democrats in the elections.
Still, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to believe after the testimony of Mr Kavanaugh and Mr Ford, even though she has a little more support.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Mr Ford's testimony completely or probably, and 35 percent say they believe in Mr Kavanaugh completely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Mr Kavanaugh was really or probably lying in giving testimony, and only 30 percent think the same about Mr Ford.
At the urging of Mr Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Mr Ford and the testimony of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported in The Guardian.
Ch. B. Ford vowed to give testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, claiming that Mr Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old when she was sober.
Mr Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitalia at a party they visited while studying at Yale University in the 9th.
The inventor of the web plans to set up a new Internet to resist Google and Facebook
The inventor of the global network, Tim Berners-Lee, is developing a new start-up to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The most recent project of this legendary inventor, Inrupt, is a company whose work is based on the Berners-Lee open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and whose information they have access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was to take control of the world.
“We have to do it now,” he said about the start-up.
- It's a historical moment."
The Solid-based app allows people to create their own personal online data store – POD.
It may contain lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser at the same time.
The personal data online store is unique in that it is up to the user to decide who and which information can be accessed.
The company calls it personal empowerment through data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and the necessary skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently the company consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, several programmers hired to work with this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not in agreement with Facebook or Google about changes that turn all business models upside down overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission."
In a report published by Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the durability and quality of the new Solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet after founding the Web Consortium at Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in discussions about Internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I feel a huge optimism about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Honored Bernard Wann – Clerk awarded the Victoria Cross in World War I
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary, the only Anglican church cleric in his hometown was honored and awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter during the First World War.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Wann earned the award during the attack on Bellengliz and Lucur on 29 September 1918.
Unfortunately, after four days, the pastor was shot dead by a sniper, so he never found out that he was awarded the highest-level British military award.
During the parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, the memory stone was unveiled by two grandchildren.
Michael Wann, one of his grandsons, said that the fact that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat, is "wonderfully symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 the lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the Saint-Kenten Canal "in the midst of a very thick fog, with a heavy blowing of guns and machine guns for fire."
Later, he hurried to the firing line and led the line forward "especially gallantly", and then alone attacked the gun and killed three of the squad's fighters.
Lieutenant Colonel B. Wanna was shot dead by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
The 72-year-old Michael Wann said that his grandfather's actions were "something that he himself would never equal, but also an extremely inspiring thing."
After a parade hosted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Micheal and his brother Dr. James Wann laid the wreath.
Micheal Wann said that it was a great honour for him to participate in the parade and added: "The bravery of a true hero is shown by the support that many people will provide."
MMA fans didn't go to sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but had to be content with Kialyte Pepa
Imagine: you don't go to bed all night to see the "Bellator 206" packed, but in the end you don't get to see the main sight.
There were 13 fights in the San Choze post office, six of them on the main card and broadcast live in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, UK audiences were stunned by the film "Kiaulytė Pepa" which interrupted the broadcast.
Some spectators were not impressed, to say the least, because it was this struggle that did not lead to sleep until the early hours.
In the TV, one of the fans called the replacement of the broadcast with a children's cartoon "some kind of sickly joke."
"According to the rules established by the government, at 6 o'clock in the morning such content was not appropriate, so it was necessary to turn on the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, the chief vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Yes, the Pig Pep."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future efforts will be made to adjust timetables to viewers in the UK.
"When I think about the repetition, it seems to me that we could probably do it," said Cocker.
“But at that time there is 6 a.m., Sunday, and we would not be able to solve this until Sunday our time – Monday their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast changed, a lot of messages were exchanged, not all of which were friendly.
We tried to remedy the situation, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no — it's a matter of power.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six – as we usually do. We wanted to give fans more, but just failed.
It's an unsuccessful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt undervalued because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to pursue success.
24 the athlete claimed only to have understood in the elementary school that they were not the same as everyone.
For the first time in the Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said that he started talking publicly about gay rights because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that winning the Olympic Games was less important when he became a father.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of this longtime show, retired from work for several months due to illness.
In the first edition conducted by L. Laverne, whose guests are asked to imagine travelling to an uninhabited island, Mr Daley said that he was growing up feeling inferior to everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He stated: "Until today, that sense of lowness and otherness has been the incentive that has given me the strength to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove himself worthy of this, not to disappoint those around him when they finally find out about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic bronze medals became a high-profile LGBT activist and, while attending this year's British Commonwealth of Nations Games, took the opportunity to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had begun to speak about it in public because he felt that he was fortunate that he could live openly without any consequences, so he would like to give others such hope.
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with a man – US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – was unexpected for him.
Last year, Mr Daley married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older, but says that the age gap never caused problems.
According to T. Delay, when you survive so much when you are so young – he attended his first Olympics only 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – it is difficult to meet someone who would be of the same age, but experienced the same highs and lows.
After the couple became the parents of their son Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, Mr Daley's perspective changed completely, he said.
“If you had listened last year, I would have said that it was most important for me to win the gold medal,” he said.
– But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
The son's name is the same as Grandpa Roberto, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Anto Daley, his father did not want to accept death, so one of his last questions was whether he had already bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, which he intended to watch while sitting in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that I wouldn’t live so long to be able to sit in the front row,” said T. Daley.
“I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he was not invulnerable,” said T. Daley.
A year later, the athlete competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that I dreamed about it all my life – to jump into the water while observing local audiences at the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of the first song for the show – Heather Small's track "Proud", which reciprocated his feelings in preparation for the Olympics and still pleasantly creeps his skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 a.m. British Summer Time.
Ph. Mickelson, who lost his form, missed Saturday's "Ryder" Cup tournament on the bench
Phil Mickelson, an American, will reach the record on Sunday because he will participate in the Ryder Cup for 47 times, but to avoid this becoming an unsuccessful anniversary, he will need to improve his form considerably.
Ph. Mickelson, who has already played in a bi-annual competition for the 12th time, was seated on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in the Saturday Fours competition.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time lead winner spent part of the day on the support team, and improved the rest of his technique on the field in order to correct errors that hindered playing.
Even without hitting extremely straight at the height of his career, 48 athletes are not the ideal player in the tight "Le Gold National" fields, whose long stretch of rough grass is extremely unfavourable for inaccurate hits.
In addition, as if the field itself were not daunting enough, in the ninth match to be held on Sunday, Ph. Mickeyson will play against Francesco Molinari, the extremely accurate British Open Tournament champion, who, along with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, won all four games this week.
If the Americans four points behind manage to start the upcoming 12-unit match well, Ph. Mickelson's match can become absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, but he would probably not be able to speak otherwise.
“He understood the role he had today, flattened me through my back and gave me his hand a hug and said that he was ready to play even tomorrow,” said Furykas.
- He doesn't lack self-confidence.
He is on the list of the most glorious athletes and has given very much to these teams both in the past and this week.
Maybe I had no idea he'd play two games.
I imagined more, but it came out like this, so we decided that we would do so.
He wants to play, just like everyone."
On Sunday, Mr. Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and become the athlete who played the most games of the "Ryder" Cup.
It is possible that this will mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which did not match the highs of his personal records.
Ph. Mickelson owns 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven draws, but Furyk says that his presence has brought intangible benefits to the team as well.
“He is funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to laugh at people and is a great guy to be in the team room with,” he explained.
– I think younger players this week also had fun competing with him, it was good to look at it.
It brings much more than a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that great leverage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big leverage in the run-up to the last competition of Ryder Cup units can easily grow into a hard fight.
The Danish athlete made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderama, where the opposing team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans, but only crossed the finish line with just a mere lead with a score of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
“We remind ourselves from time to time that we had a great leverage in Valderama; we had a great leverage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderama, where we won, but only barely,” said T. Bjorn (in the picture), who observed the victory of the 2018 edition with a result of 5:3 on Friday and 10:6 at Le Golf National Square.
So the story will tell me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
It's gonna take all the strength tomorrow.
Go and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not finished.
We have the goal of trying to win this prize, so we have to pursue it consistently.
I've always said, I rely on those 12 players who are on our side, but we know perfectly well who stands on the other side – the world's best players."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a difficult field, T. Bjorn added: “I would never want to preempt myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a whole different hair thing.
Tomorrow the most important game will be an individual game – it's quite different.
It's great to play with your partner when things go well, but when you're in the field alone, the limits of your ability to play golf are tested.
This idea needs to be implemented by players – tomorrow you have to squeeze everything out of yourself.
Now I'm gonna have to break up with my partner, and he's gonna have to squeeze everything out of himself too."
In contrast to T. Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to appear better individually than as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself suffered both sides of the surprises of the last day, as Brooklyn was on the winning team before Europe performed the miracle of Medina and turned them into losers."
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, when asked how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players to prepare for the final day.
– Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but seek a quick start – the one you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration in one direction occurs, the middle games become very strained.
Accordingly, we formed our team and released the players in a way that, for us, you know...we're trying to create some kind of magic tomorrow."
Mr Thomas will have the task of trying to lead the counteroffensive and competing with Rory McIlroy in the top-level match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are leading the Europeans.
"I chose these guys precisely in this order, because I think they will successfully beat the whole game," said T. Bjorn about his choice for unit matches.
Delivery of a new German naval vessel postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy had to start work as early as 2014 and replace the Cold War military ships, but according to the local press, we will not see it until at least next year due to increasingly perishable systems and an extremely high price.
According to a representative of the military, quoted by Die Zeit newspaper, the commissioning of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was clouded by the problems that had already begun to plague the ship being delivered.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy as early as 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are believed to be equipped with a powerful gun, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and certain secrecy technologies such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic footprints.
Another important feature is longer maintenance intervals, which allow the latest frigates to navigate far away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, due to the continuing delays in the state of the art, warships, which are said to allow Germany to direct military power to overseas territories, will become obsolete before they are put into service.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate came under headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship already delivered to the builder.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German press mentions several fundamental software and hardware defects that would have caused the ship to have been useless on a military mission.
Deficiencies in the software are particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers – a force half smaller than the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, this ship proved to be severely too heavy, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to introduce various improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is estimated to be twice as heavy as the comparable class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project – alongside perishable technical equipment, including crew training – is also slowly becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from an initial amount of 2.2 billion euros to a staggering 3.1 billion (3.6 billion dollars).
The latest problems plagued by the frigate have become particularly significant following recent warnings that the power of the German navy is waning.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chief of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the navy was actually "in need of usable vessels".
The official said that problems had formed over time, as old ships had already been written off, but there was nothing to replace them.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
A new study conducted at a Scottish highland estate aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new knowledge of the behavior of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will observe the dwarfs, soprano bats, brown abalones and water mouses in the gardens of Wester Ross Inverev in their research.
Special recorders will be placed in certain areas of the area, allowing to track bat activity throughout the season.
National Health Service staff and volunteers will also perform mobile tests with handheld detectors.
The expert analysis of all sound recordings will determine the frequency of signals emitted by bats and the type of activity.
A map and report of residential habitats will then be created to help shape a detailed behavioural picture on the scale of the entire landscape.
National Trust for Scotland (NTS) conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat is most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help identify the benefits of residential habitat maintenance, such as the creation of grasslands, as well as how best to look after wooded areas to be suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development works affecting hatcheries and destroying residential habitats.
Wind turbines and lightning are also a threat, as are ours, some chemicals used to process construction materials, as well as hunting domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, ears are more helpful than eyes to catch prey during night hunting.
Bats accurately determine the location of insects or obstacles in the flight path by an elaborate echolocation method.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide, is extremely responsible towards bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, hatchery inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first and only reserve specifically for bats in Scotland in Damfries and the Threeve Manor in Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
Manor caretaker David Thompson says the manor area is ideal for them.
“We have a great place for bats at Threeave Manor,” he said.
– We have old buildings, many mature trees and great areas to live in.
However, we still do not know much about bats, so work here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need in order to thrive."
He emphasizes that it is essential to check for bats before the site's maintenance work begins, as the accidental destruction of one hatchery could kill up to 400 females and juveniles, which could lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats shall be protected and shall be prohibited from being killed, teased or disturbed, as well as from destroying their hatcheries.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Fund for Bat Protection, urged the public to contribute to the rescue of the batsmen.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't even know how many populations of native species are going."
Mr Ronaldo dismissed rape charges – lawyers intend to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called his accusations of rape "false lies" and said that people using his name "are seeking to become famous".
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The forward attacker of Portugal and Juventus clubs is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorg in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he then allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep the event silent.
Speaking to 142 million followers in a live video of Instagram a few hours after reports of accusations, 33-year-old Ronaldo criticized the reports and called them "false."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today – lies," said the winner of "Ballon d’Or" five times while looking at the camera.
- They want to be famous by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous, say my name – that's part of my job.
I'm a happy man, it's okay," added the athlete smilingly.
According to Reuters, Ch. Ronaldo's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel on charges they called "unacceptable publicity of allegations of matters taking place in private space."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the athlete would seek compensation for "moral damage the amount of which would correspond to the significance of this violation – perhaps one of the most serious violations of an individual's law in the last few years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms casino and hotel apartments in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed with the Nevada Clark County Court, after meeting at the nightclub Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room, where he allegedly raped her anally.
According to Mayorga, after an alleged incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he was a "99 percent good man" betrayed by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo acknowledged that the couple had sex, but claimed they were contractual.
Mayorga also says that she appealed to the police and her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she "feared retaliation" and was worried that she would be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to withdraw the agreement as she continues to feel traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged assault, Ronaldo was bepering from Manchester United to Real Madrid club, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juventus.
Brexitas: The United Kingdom would regret losing car manufacturers forever
According to Secretary of Business Affairs Greg Clark, the United Kingdom would "forever regret" if it lost its world-leading status after Brexito.
He added that he was concerned about the statement made by Toyota in the United Kingdom to the BBC that production at the Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily suspended after Britain left the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clarkas.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the loss of jobs in the event of a "Brexit" at the border without an agreement would mean the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will have to stop production in our factory," said Burnastone Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also voiced concerns about leaving the EU without the agreement and its effects on international trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit will close its Mini plant for a month.
According to car manufacturers, the most worrying are the threats that will be posed to the supply chain Brexit without a contract.
Toyota’s production line operates when needed, as parts are delivered to custom cars from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a treaty on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border; according to the industry, this may result in delays or lack of details.
Toyota claimed that it would not be able to store the stocks for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would stop.
According to Clark, the plan of Theresa May's Chequers for future relations with the EU is "designed precisely to avoid such border checks".
"We need a contract. We want to have the best contract that, as I say, would allow not only to enjoy success today, but also to seize this opportunity," he said to the BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
"Not only Toyota, but also other car manufacturers show the need for continued access to the very successful supply chain system."
Toyota could not say for what time production would stop, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and responsible for the Unite trade union meetings there, said that his union members were increasingly concerned: "I say from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never return."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed an ambitious and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
"As the fight for the Supreme Court candidate continues, a very important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for another week," the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller – the latter investigating Russian interference in the election, Trump's assistants' ties to Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would dismiss the Deputy Attorney General, thus threatening Mueller's independence, fueled rumors in Washington for many months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility to remove the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
However, in the wake of the announcements of his resignation, he went to the White House last Monday.
It was instead announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to forgive Rosenstein. Later, the meeting was postponed to not coincide with the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting where both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford – one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump was told by the FBI to investigate the accusations made by Kavanaugh within a week, thus again delaying the vote in a plenary Senate hearing.
Trump's spokesperson Sarah Sanders appeared on the Fox newscast on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It has no date, it may happen this week, but in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see, I always like to tell the press the news."
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: from September 10, Sanders did not hold any White House press conference.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that press conferences rarely take place because they do not like TV journalists seeking "effects for viewers". It is true, he added: "I have to agree with the fact that they seek effects for viewers."
He then hinted that Trump would more often communicate directly with the press.
"The President answers questions more often than any previous president," she said, and without providing any evidence, added: "We have reviewed these statistics."
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do so, and you have seen that this has been happening many times in recent weeks, and the press conferences will be replaced by your direct contact with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with respectable guests.
Press conferences of one person are rare.
A free and sometimes bizarre presidential appearance against journalists this week in New York probably explained why.
The Minister of Health wrote to Scottish NSB workers from the EU about the concerns raised by Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to Scottish NSB workers from the EU expressing the country's gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent the letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public service sector entrusted to it.
Mr Freeman wrote in a letter: "In the summer, the UK and the EU negotiations on the withdrawal continued and are approaching the expected solutions this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also started to prepare more quickly for a possible scenario without a contract.
I know you're all very worried now.
That is why I wanted to repeat how I value the contribution of all employees – no matter what their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie, who suffered a head injury, underwent emergency surgery
On Saturday, Christian Abercrombie, journalist of Tennessean, Mike Organ, performed an emergency operation for the team of Vanderbilt Commodores, which lost the match to the head trauma suffered by the Tennessee State Tigers by a score of 31:27.
Head coach of Tennessee State Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and there he just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medics at the sideline Abercrombie gave a breath of oxygen, later laid on a stretcher and sent out for further research.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris of Nashville, Tennessee, told WSMV that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center had been completed.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type and extent of the injury", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it happened.
Abercrombie, who spends the sport season officially, moved from Illinois and plays the first season in the Tennessee State team.
Before leaving the game, he rebounded five balls on Saturday, and his total number of rebounds in a season reached 18.
Foreign buyers of UK real estate will have to pay a higher stamp duty
According to the new Tory plans, foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay a higher stamp duty, and the additional money they receive will be used to help the homeless
This move will reduce the risk posed by the successful Corbyno campaign to attract young voters
In addition, the Commission notes that the UK tax exemption does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
The Ministry of Finance expects to be able to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Today, Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK are going to be subject to a higher rate stamp duty, and that the additional money they receive will be used to help the homeless
With the promise of more affordable housing and targeting high-income people, this move is expected to reduce the risk posed by the successful Jeremy Corbyno campaign to attract young voters.
The UK tax-free persons and businesses will be subject to the increased stamp duty and the additional money received will be used to promote the government's anti-homelessness campaign.
The additional charge – paid next to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for the rent of second houses or houses – can reach as much as three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this move will allow up to £120 million a year to be raised.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property in London is purchased by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it more difficult for buyers to buy the first home.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, so many rich neighborhoods in the country and especially the capital have become haunted cities.
The new strategy was introduced just weeks later when Boris Johnson called for a reduced stamp duty to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of quickly buying up the land but not using it, they support high property prices, and called on May to address Britain's embarrassment of housing by abandoning affordable house quotas.
Corbyn announced several eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including control of rental prices and a ban on eviction without fault.
In addition, he wants to give more power to build new houses to municipal councils.
May said: “Last year, I told you that when I was Prime Minister, I would try to bring back the British dream – every new generation must have a better life.
This means that we need to clean up our disturbed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it is not right that non-residents and companies established abroad in the UK can buy their homes as easily as hard-working British people.
For many people, the dream of having housing has become almost unfulfilled, and the threat of humiliating homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to lead the Scotland national team
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says that his ultimate goal is to ever become head of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently in the third place of the first league and three points behind the first-placed club.
After taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season, he moved to Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I went to the B team and it all ended", Ross told the BBC programme "Scotland's Sportsound".
“But as a child, I grew up at Hamden Stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish national competitions, which always attracted me back.
It is true that this opportunity will only take place if I manage the club successfully."
To Ross, Sunderland was led by Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Royʼus Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Having previously rejected the proposals of "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town", the former manager of "Alloa Athletic" says that he did not feel anxious to start working after such well-known managers in such a large club.
"Now my success will be assessed on the basis of the answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Premier League?"
According to the structure and conditions, this club is definitely part of the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to take him there, but it's probably only when I bring the club back to the league that I think I've worked successfully here."
Rosso's leadership career lasts only three years. Before that, he worked as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and replaced Hearts coaches for 15 months.
He later helped to recover after Alloa fell to the third division, and turned St Mirren's club, which was threatened to fall, into the winners of the championship the following season.
Ross says that he is more satisfied now than he has ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical clubs.
"This change was probably radical", he remembers about the leadership of Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that it was right to lead me – it was better than to play.
It sounds strange because I was successful, I made a lot of money, and I enjoyed satisfying accomplishments.
But playing can be hard.
A lot of problems have to be overcome every week.
And now it's not easy – working stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do it. As an adult, I always felt that I was in my sleigh, but leadership is the most rewarding."

Studies have found that the best time for a pint of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the income of the needy British brewers, but made the burden on restaurant chains even more difficult.
Numbers revealed that sales of brewery and bar groups increased 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants, revenue fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy CGA, which produced the data, said: “The endless sunbathing and the longer-than-expected presence of England in the World Championship meant that in July, similar trends continued as in June, when brewers’ income increased by 2.8 percent.
In June, shopping in restaurants fell 1.8 percent, and in July the situation became even worse.
The main proceeds from the sale of beverages by brewers and bars were undoubtedly the best results, and the trade in them grew more strongly than in restaurants.
Although not as much as restaurant businesses, the main income from food sales has also been hit in the sun.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In well-ordered breweries and bars, liquor sales increased 6.6 percent this month, while food sales fell by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, from the leisure and hospitality sector analysis company RSM, says: “These results continue the trend seen since the end of April.
With regard to catering establishments, the main factors remain the weather and the impact of major social and sporting events.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle. True, the drop in sales of 4.8 percent over the years will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to the continuing cost-related pressure.
For companies with the highest income from food trade, a long hot summer could not come at a worse time. Time will tell if the milder temperature in August will provide the necessary respite."
The overall growth in sales in breweries and restaurants, including newly opened venues, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the slowdown in brand-owned networking.
The UK sales monitoring tool for the brewery, bar and restaurant sector, recognised by the UK guidelines, collects and analyses operational data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than £9 billion.
One in five children has social media accounts hidden from their parents
The study revealed that one in five children – some just 11 years old – have social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake "Insta" pages was increasing
The news has heightened fears of published sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had to show their parents a dedicated main account
One in five children – some just 11 years old – create secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake "Insta" pages was increasing rapidly – it is a link to the photo sharing website "Instagram".
The news has heightened fears of published sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they were using a censored main account to show their parents, but also have covert accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, learned that the teenage girl was insisting, “Pull me up. ”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors' Conference (MDC) found that 40 percent of 11 to 18 year olds had two accounts, and half of these students acknowledged that they were hiding the accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of the MDC, said: “The fact that so many teenagers succumb to the temptation to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them is alarming. ”
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Sports Council
At the general annual meeting of the governing body of the Scottish Sports Council, Eilidha Doyle was elected as its consultant director.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish lightweight and chairwoman. Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for sports executives to benefit from the various experiences she has gained at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidha has earned great respect throughout the sports community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we have no doubt that its inclusion in the council will bring great benefits to Scottish sport," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I really want to serve as the voice of athletes and I hope I will really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The 200 and 400 metres events at the 1996 Atlanta Games and a total of four Olympic gold medals won by an American, now appearing as a permanent BBC expert, could not walk after suffering a short ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell if and to what extent I will recover.
I had to work until I was exhausted, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I do exercise in agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
The breast thrush advertisement, in which mothers are compared to cows, received different ratings online
The company that makes breast thrushes received different opinions about its advertising, in which feeding mothers are compared to dairy cows.
In order to mark the start of sales of the product, described as the world's first silent portable breast elevation, the consumer technology company Elvie has released a commercial inspired by an ironic music video, which aims to demonstrate the freedom that the new thrush gives to nursing mothers.
Four true mothers dance to the sound recording in the hay-filled cowl, for example, such words as: "Yes, I pray myself, but no tail is seen" and "If you do not notice, this is not the udder, this is my breasts."
The appendix continues: “Take him out, take him out, feed him the babies, take him out, take him out, I pray my beauties. ”
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused an online dispute.
The video, which was viewed 77,000 times and received several hundred comments, was reacted to in various ways by viewers, many saying that it overlooks the horrors of the dairy industry.
‘The use of cows to promote this product is a very poor solution.
Like us, they must conceive and give birth to produce milk, only their newborns are taken away from them a few days later," wrote one woman.
Elvie breast thrush inconspicuously fits in the feeding bra ("Elvie" / "Mother")
Another commented: “It is understood that it is traumatic for both the mother and the newborn child.
But why not use them for an advertisement delivering a breast thrush for mothers who don't take babies away?"
Someone added: "Advertisement is a total misunderstanding."
Other commentators defended the advertising – one woman acknowledged that she found the song "very fun".
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy it if I still fed it.
By interrupting my milk, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant," he wrote alone.
Another commented: “This fun ad is meant for mothers who take their milk off (often in workplaces or toilets) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group reveals that they all danced with inconspicuous thrushes embedded in the bras.
The idea of the campaign is based on the insight that many women who stop breast milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie thrush does not emit any sound, has no wires or tubes and does not noticeably fit in the feeding bra – thus, women can move freely, keep their babies or even leave the house as they withdraw their milk.
Mother's partner and executive creative director Ana Balarin commented: Elvie's thrush is a revolutionary product that deserves to be launched boldly and provocatively.
When comparing feeding women with dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the interruption of milk and all the challenges it poses, while having fun and showing as much as possible the incredible sense of freedom that the new thrush will provide.
Elvie's thrush came to the headlines of the press for a number of times.
During London Fashion Week, the designer Martha Jakubowski's collection of two children's mother demonstrated on the podium using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border has not changed substantially during the month, but the number of detained migrant children has increased significantly, partly because the strict rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have made it more difficult to accommodate them with guardians.
Traditionally, most guardians themselves were immigrants without documents and feared that applying for custody of a child would risk the possibility of staying in the country.
In June, when the federal government announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk increased further.
Matthew Albence, Chief Executive of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified to Congress last week that the institution had detained several dozen people who had applied for custody of unaccompanied minors in adults.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously tried.
"Almost 80 percent of these persons – guardians or their family members – live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to persecute these people", said Albence.
According to the shelter's staff, in order to consider children's cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules, which require some children to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than within 60 days, as was usual in the past.
Many will try to defend their application for legal status against a judge on immigration issues by means of a conference video call rather than a personal one.
Those who are not eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Defenders say that this is even more worrying in large institutions such as the Tornille Shelter: because of their size, there is an increased likelihood of not noticing signs that the child is suffering.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the traumas that many have already suffered.
Syria U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces ordered immediate withdrawal
In addition, in an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces under the pretext of counter-terrorism on Syrian soil are illegitimate and will be treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions", he said to the Assembly.
Moualem asserted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to leave their homes, the war on terrorism is almost over.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight this sacred struggle until we eradicate both terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in all Syrian territories.
There are approximately 2,000 United States troops in Syria who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were good, while at the same time accusing some Western countries of spreading an unwarranted fear that deters refugees from returning.
"We have moved to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return," he said.
"They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will only receive reconstruction aid when Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel stronghold in Idlib has created the conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces targeting a province with a population of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement contained clear deadlines. In addition, he expressed his hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including militants from the Al-Qaeda-related Nusra front, which would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a committee made up of members of the government and opposition to prepare a draft of Syria's post-war constitution and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions under which the Syrian government would participate in the committee – the work of the group must be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why will Trump be elected for a second term?
Based on this logic, Trump would be elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators may expect, his presidency would end prematurely with impeachment and scandal.
Undoubtedly, that would be the most dramatic end to the presidency ever!
So far, no signs of fatigue have been seen by the audience.
Since 2014, the best broadcast time ratings on CNN TV have increased more than twice as much as 1.05 million, and on MSNBC almost three times as much as 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of the best broadcasting time, growing from 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show ranks first in the cable TV ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the main news evenings.
"It's a fire that attracts people because we don't understand something," says Neal Baer, who produces the ABC series "Descedent" about the Cabinet Secretary, who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the House of Congress.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Only fun parts and a few unpleasant truths, how to secretly get to the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
“He said, ‘He makes me laugh,’ Scovell said.
The value of chaos is that it cheers.
Of course, unlike other shows shown on television, storylines coming from Washington may determine the future of the case Roe v. Wade, the ability to unite for immigrant families, and the state of the global economy.
Non-watching is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it's more than necessary to be an informed citizen when you realize that for six hours now you've been watching a group of experts discuss how Bob Woodward uses sensitive data for his book Fear, Paul Manafort demonstrates an ostrich skin jacket costing $15,000 ("thicks of conceited clothing" wrote in The Washington Post) and what the shocking description of Stormy Daniels Trump's anatomy means.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario again.
"His actions remind you of the reality show, because every night he drops something to you", Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Pawn Stars, the creator of "Wheelhouse Entertainment", says about the changing characters of the Trump show and the daily twists of the plot (the entanglement in the conflict with N.F.L. or the praise to Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a single series, otherwise you'll be behind.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, there were 27 degrees of heat outside his home on the north coast of Kauai and the sun shone, but he was tumbling inside and watching MSNBC while recording for CNN.
He couldn't tear himself off – certainly not when Brett Kavanaugh had a station before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung on his hair.
“I remember when we once made these crazy shows, people said: ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’, Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The intense struggle of the mid-term elections to the House of Representatives comes with money from around
It is no wonder that due to the reshuffle of congressional districts, which resulted in an attempt by two members of the House of Representatives to win the same post, Pennsylvania's 17th district was flooded with money.
The recently redrawed suburban Pittsberg County included Democrat House of Representatives member Conor Lamb in a fight—he won his seat last spring in a special election in another district.
Lamb competes with another member of the House of Representatives, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the previous Pennsylvania District 12. Much of it overlaps with the new 17th.
Maps redrawed when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that in violation of the constitution, the old constituencies were falsified in favor of Republicans.
During an election fight in the new 17th district, the main party financial institutions—the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DKKC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRKK)—have been in turmoil over the campaign's finances.
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania when a small margin of votes in the 18th congressional district won the widely viewed March special election.
Republicans have held the seat for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the County.
Political experts gave the Democrats some advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then calmed down
Diplomats have observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, but have generally not received a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in this country before his partners moved the management of Trump Organization.
"Due to recent decisions no longer recognised, Taiwanese State Department officials have decided to withdraw heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama," said Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in a report released earlier this month.
But sanctions are only considered for El Salvador, which received approximately US$140 million in American aid in 2017, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions on individuals, would have been painful for a Central American country with high levels of unemployment and murder.
As part of the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward to prevent migrants coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the highest officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and thus largely ended any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
"In order to demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to this gathering, Vice President Mike Pence is now on the list of speakers of the conference planned for mid-October," the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, reporting no reprimands or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman refused to comment to Bolton on the details of the discussion, which were told by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations only if their anonymity was maintained.
Their accounts are confirmed by an outsider analyst close to the administration, who has also spoken if his anonymity is maintained.
Learn History
Further it is inevitably possible to wait for the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice – very strong evidence of him is now available in public archives.
In addition, as is being said, Mueller addresses his investigation into whether Trump's campaign has not been conducted in secret in cooperation with Russia, which has undermined our elections.
If Congress were to move into other hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution – at the same time as he is about to stand again against voters, and perhaps finally against a commission of officials.
There is a lot of "if" here, and I do not claim that Trump's end is inevitable – as is its equivalent in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic will have to make a choice, and these choices will determine whether the fight will last for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler — only the West had to resist him and support Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We screwed up and missed the chance to prevent the carnage that followed for several years.
History is moving around such crucial turning points – then the irresistible march of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
Americans have now found themselves at a few such crucial turning points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the fate of Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein's troubles began when this newspaper reported that last year an official suggested secretly recording the president and considered his inadequacy for the position.
Rosenstein says that The Times' story is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh proves incomplete or incorrect or if despite persuasive accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony, this candidate will be appointed to the Supreme Court?
And, finally, will we vote for Congress in the midterm election, which will force Trump to take responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy is facing a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we'll keep it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, once located in the home where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later I was sent to light Sabbath candles on a table with swastika.
When I have such a legacy, how could I view our future unoptimistically?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers' clash with Rapid Vienna awaits optimism
On Thursday, Rapid Vienna will accept Rangers knowing that if they won against Austrians after the impressive match with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, they could find themselves in a strong position allowing them to leave Group G.
Due to a knee injury, middle player Graham Dorrans was only able to appear this season for the first time by a 2:2 result in the final competition with Villarreal. But he hopes that Rangers club can use this result as a springboard towards more important goals.
“We had a good result because Villarreal is a great team”, said 31-year-old player.
“We started playing with the belief that we will achieve something and finished with something.
Perhaps we could have been more accurate at the end, but the competition was not bad at all.
They must have played better in the first quarter, and we've stepped up in the second and turned out to be a better team.
Thursday will be another significant European League evening.
I hope that we can get three points. The game will be difficult because in the latter competition their score was great. But I have no doubt that with the support of the audience we can advance and achieve a good result.
Last year really was a difficult year – both what happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope that we will now be able to advance, forget last season and play successfully."
This fear of pension savings causes women to suffer from insomnia
Although the interviewers clearly imagined the kind of care they would like to have, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide study said that they talked to the spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't try to talk about it," stated Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide life insurance company.
That's where we need to start.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not give advance notice of your wishes, your family will not be prepared to take care of you.
With your counselor and family, discuss where and what kind of care you would like to receive, as these factors may be important to predict costs.
Call a financial adviser. The advisor can also help you to come up with a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care can decide to cover these costs by means of a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life assurance policy or by covering your assets as long as you have the money.
Prepare legal documents. Prevent legal disputes by means of documents permitting protection.
Prepare a health authority. Appoint a reliable person to take care of your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Think also of the power to take care of your finances.
You should choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you become incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother needs emergency medical attention and is taken to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
To be ready, write these details in the plan.
“What’s important is not just the financial questions. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
‘What medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan that as well."
Ilfrakume pneumatic rifle multiple-shot man
After spending the evening in the city, the man who went home was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
A forty-year-old victim was shot in the chest, belly, and arm by Ilfracum in the Oxford district of Grauv, Devon.
At approximately 02.30 a.m., the shooting was described by officials as an accidental act in England's summer time.
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries do not threaten his life, and the police ask witnesses for help.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
"At least 384 were killed when the Indonesian city of Palu was struck by a powerful earthquake and tsunami on Friday," say officials.
Due to the destruction of communications emergency services, officials could not obtain any data from the Dongala regenty, north of the Palu area, located nearby from the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In the aftermath of the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, Palu, with about 379,800 inhabitants, is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, established at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the quake struck and the tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regentity that stretches along the more than 300 km (180 miles) coastline of the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regentiste – for the province in the smaller administrative region – had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic pillars of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The mining of nickel is also important in the province, however, mainly concentrated on the other side of Sulawesi on the coast of Moroval.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times over the past century by tsunamis.
In 1938, a tsunami in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, a tsunami struck western Dongal in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia, on the seismically active ring of Pacific fire, is constantly being struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a strong quake on the western shore of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several strong quakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near her.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 quake struck the southern part of the most densely populated island of Indonesia, Java, and caused a tsunami that struck the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
A magnitude 7.6 quake in 2009 struck the area near Padang, the western capital of Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
In 2010, a magnitude 7.5 quake struck one near Sumatra in the Mentawai Islands and caused a tsunami with waves up to 10 meters, sweeping dozens of villages and killing approximately 300 people.
2016 As a result of the minor earthquake, the regenty of Pidije Jaya in Aceh was devastated and panic broke out as people remembered how everything was devastated after the terrible 2004 quake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
In 2018, Strong quakes shook the Indonesian tourist-rich island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily stuck on the coast.
Chief son of Sarah Palin detained on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to an Alaska police report released on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin from Vasila, Aliaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resistance in detention.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
As reported by KTUU, Palin was returned to the pre-trial detention facility in Mat-Su and released on a $500 bail.
"On Saturday he appeared in court, where he claimed to be completely innocent when asked to excuse himself," the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses – meaning that he may be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with class B misconduct, penalizing a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstruction of reporting the crime of domestic violence and possession of guns while intoxicated.
His girlfriend stated that he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups when he linked the cruel behavior of his son to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communications networks are not working, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media share videos showing the moment of the tsunami strike.
The tsunami struck the coast when hundreds of people had gathered for a beach celebration in Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek rarely applied death penalty for New York terrorist attack suspect
In New York, federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is suspected that on October 31, thirty-year-old Saipov rented a truck from Home Depot and made an attack on a bicycle path along the western highway in Lower Manhattan – he laid out pedestrians and cyclists while riding on the trail.
According to a report filed in the southern district of New York on the intention to seek the death penalty, prosecutors to justify the sentence will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily injuries.
According to a court document, both of these indictment points may incur the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury of the implicated issued a 22-point indictment to Saipov, covering eight charges of murder involving extortion (usually applied by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases), and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say the attack was very well planned and premeditated, and the way Saipov executed it has been called gross, cruel and immoral.
"The actions of Sayfullo Habibullaevicius Saipov caused injuries, injuries and loss of loved ones to the following families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco," the announcement of intentions.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case requiring the death penalty was heard in the Southern District of New York a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes, the accused, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The latter time was executed in 1953 in a New York federal case against Julius and Ethele Rosenbergs, spouses, when they were convicted two years ago of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not regret his act either immediately after the attack or a few months later.
According to police, he stated to investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired by Islamic State (ISIS) videos that he viewed on his phone to carry out the attack.
Police reported that he also asked the hospital to hang the Islamic State flag in the ward.
He did not admit his guilt under 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's representative federal state-funded defenders, said they were obviously disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to admit guilt and to spend life in prison without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events to all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory parliamentarian says that the Brexit negotiations must be carried out under the responsibility of NIGELAS FARAGEÑAS
Today, during the protest at the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilise the nation's army.
A former UKIP leader said politicians must feel the heat of Eurosceptics, and one of Theresa May's party parliamentarians suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative House of Commons, told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have left now if Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the difficulties that May faces in trying to unite the divided ranks of supporters were revealed by the EU-protective tors who joined the separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to implement the compromise plan agreed in her Czech Republic when it is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostile reaction and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihal that he wanted to disrupt the Checkers' plan.
He argued that Farage should have been an equal partner and should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had taken the lead, we would have already left the EU," he said.
The Member of Parliament for Wellingboro added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Checkers' plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in the world wars to obey others.
We want our own laws in our country."
Bone has denied hints that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "It is absolutely not true that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU."
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also participated in the demonstrations and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, hear the people.
The Czechers plan is unpopular among the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular among our party members and activists who are taking to the streets and, above all, voting for us.
Give up the Checkers' plan and start listening."
In a critical report, May added: "The Prime Ministers retain their posts when they keep their promises."
Farage said that rallying politicians must be forced to feel the heat if they issue a referendum decision in 2016.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the nation and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, so today we are here to tell them that we will not let ourselves get away with doing so."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing an army of this country's nation, which brought us the Brexit victory, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
And Brexit's opponents marched the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
When the group was formed this weekend, a group of activists waved posters entitled "Tories Against Brexit".
Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they experienced as a result of the party's app starting the conference.
"These are people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies needed for the "Canada plus plus" option, for friction-free borders and free trade with Ireland," he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider taking part in presidential elections
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would seriously consider taking part in the presidential election after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat had spoken about her future at a meeting with the public in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who constantly criticizes President Donald Trump, is taking part in the November run-off election to face GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, one of the leaders of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was speculated that she could compete with Trump in 2020.
Since Trump became president, the Saturday afternoon event in Holjok was her 36 meeting with voters using a public meeting format.
One participant asked if she was planning to participate in the presidential election.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix the collapsed government, and this must be led by a woman.
Arrested suspect in LSU Sims shooting case
Police in the city of Louisiana Baton Rouge reported on Saturday that they detained the suspect accused of shooting LSU basketball player Waydeș Sims on Friday.
At a press conference at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department reported that twenty-year-old Dyeon Simpson had been detained.
Police circulated a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help to identify the man seen in it.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and died near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul informed the media on Saturday that Wayde Sims had been shot in the head and died as a result of his injuries.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, had a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was not resisted while in custody and was placed in custody by the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
Sims, a 198 cm tall penultimate course student, grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the previous season, 10 of which started in the starting five, spending an average of 17.4 minutes per game on the court, scoring 5.6 points each, and rebounding 2.9 balls each.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton came close to the title of world champion when the team instructed him to give a victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Valtter Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton in qualifying drive on Saturday, it immediately became clear that Mercedes' team's instructions in the race would be extremely important.
After starting the race from first place, Bott started well and, defending his position in the first two turns, almost left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to turn into a two-barreled garage, left Hamilton and he returned to the race in the tail of a group, so it was fatal.
Mercedes stopped in a two-block garage after the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton broke out ahead after the actions that had barely ended in contact, when Ferrari's driver, after a double maneuver, was reluctant to loosen the inside side of the track in order to save the position in the third turn.
Max Verstappen, who was celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the end of the formation, but was already driving seventh at the end of the first lap.
He was the fastest for most of the race as he drove without changing the tires to be as fast as possible in the finish, ahead of Kimi Raikkonen and finishing fourth.
At last, he turned into a two-barreled garage in round 44, but was unable to increase the pace in the remaining eight laps and Raikkonen crossed the finish line fourth.
“Waltter had a difficult day because he was doing well all weekend, and when he was asked to miss me, he acted like a true gentleman.
The team did a great job and won the two first places," said Hamilton.
It was a really poor body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a meeting with the people on Saturday for persistently denying that she had leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which a Supreme Court Justice candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, is accused of sexual abuse.
In his speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly name the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Law Committee, but said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were wicked, indecent, and unjust.
"What may have happened and actually happens in recent days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see that people are evil, wicked, obscene and unjust," he said.
"When you see official statements and leaks, and then you say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer to the question, did she leak the document? “Oh, oh, what?
Not at all.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked," he added, portraying a senator.
As early as July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh and which had been leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee: "I didn't hide Dr Ford's accusations and I didn't leak her story."
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the president did not seem to agree with her denial, saying during a meeting with the people on Saturday evening: “You know, it was a really bad body language.
It may not have leaked, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Further defending a candidate for Supreme Court justice who was accused of illegal sexual conduct by three women, the president said that Democrats had used the charges for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power by whatever means are needed.
You see scumbagness, obsceneness; they don't care what they hurt or what they have to drive over to gain power and control," quoted the President's speech "Mediaitė".
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in a match with Dandi club Giants
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League defeat by the Belfast Giants and won Saturday's retaliation game Dandi by a score of 5:3.
The Giants broke out early on when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier won two goals by throws.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie had evened the score before Dwyer took the Giants forward again.
Francois Bouchard of the Dandi team equalised the score, but later two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the win.
Adam Keefe's men suffered a third defeat this season in the Elite League, before catching up on Friday night in Belfast and defeating Dandi's club by a score of 2:1.
This was the fourth team meeting this season, three previous games won by the Giants.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendall McFaullo's transfer, and after four more minutes passed, Beauvillier doubled the leverage after David Rutherford's transfer.
In the hard-starting game, Sullivan returned the Arena hosts to the game scoring a goal at 13:10, and after Matt Marquardt's transfer, Cownie equalised the score at 15:16.
Dwyer arranged for the Giants to go to the first break in the lead, and earned their second goal of the evening at the end of the first quarter.
With a quantitative margin, the Square hosts regrouped and Bouchard again equalled the score at 27:37.
Cownieșis and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen advance the Dandi team for the first time in the match at the end of the second quarter, and established the win by earning the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Giants, who have already lost the last four games out of five, will meet Milton Keynes' team at home next Friday.
Air traffic controller killed to help hundreds of plane passengers escape the earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero when he died helping an aircraft with several hundred passengers to safely take off into the air.
More than 800 people have died and numerous are considered missing after a strong earthquake that shook Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The area is further shaken by strong repeated underground strikes and numerous people trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although colleagues escaped saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a sharply fluctuating control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained at his station to help the 6321 Batik Air aircraft, which was already on the runway at the time, to take off safely.
Then thinking that the control tower was collapsing, he jumped out of it.
He later died in hospital.
According to ABC News Australia, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Siraito said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We flew it by helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is a very painful message for us," he added.
And authorities fear that the death toll could rise to thousands, as the country's disaster relief agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Sigi, and Boutongo are hard to reach.
"It is expected that the number of victims will increase as many victims are still under the rubble and we cannot reach them," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six meters high have devastated the city of Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supply supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute, ambulances bring victims.
There is a lack of clean water.
Robbing buffet shops everywhere."
Janis Gelfand, head of the Indonesian Red Cross International, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation may get worse."
Indonesian President Yok Widd arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was shaken by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Newgini now says that one person is missing when the plane falls into the lagoon
The airline that conducted the flight, which ended with the plane crash in the Micronesia-owned Pacific lagoon, now says that one person is missing, although previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from the sinking aircraft.
In a report, Air Newgini said that on Saturday afternoon they had no knowledge of one male passenger.
Airlines indicated that they are collaborating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their search for a man.
Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
Airlines said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It remains unclear what led to the accident and what was the exact sequence of events.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing path.
Some witnesses to the incident believe that the plane missed landing on the landing path.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from very low.
"It was very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that on a sinking and waist flooded plane, he and the others managed to get to emergency exits.
He said the flight attendants were engulfed in panic and shouting while he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that their sailors who had repaired the nearby pier also helped rescue people who had been transported ashore by inflatable boat before the plane drowned to a depth of about 30 metres.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in the crashes of airline aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but none have been part of Air Newgini.
Analyst set out the sequence of events of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office set out the facts available in a retrial case on Saturday of a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a forensic expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone records to combine the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the nineteen-year-old victim Jessica Chambers movement into the whole on the night of his death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis was with Chamber on the evening of her death, which contradicts previous statements.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford made his position known and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "did lie because his truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Telly claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records show they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis erased Chambers messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," said Hale.
It is scheduled that the defense will begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he thought the case would be handed over to jurors later that day.
The High Breed: Who is a conscious hip hop?
The Hiphop Trio wants to change the negative attitude towards this genre by spreading positive messages with their music.
The High Breed claims from Bristol that hip hop has moved away from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to return to the origins of hip hop and promote conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently been reborn in UK works by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?!
New York's nanny sued the couple after being fired because of a "racist" message
The New York babysitter sued the couple for dismissal on grounds of discrimination after receiving a false address message from her mother complaining that she was "another black woman".
The couple denies being racist and called the lawsuit "rape".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was upset to learn that the new child caretaker, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEE, ONE MORE BLACK," Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, she was twice sent not by her husband, but by Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, having understood that Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and dismissed Ms. Maurice, claiming that the previous nanny, who was African-American, had done her job badly and hoped to wait for a Filipino woman instead.
Mr. Maurice was paid for one working day and she was sent home by "Uber" car.
Maurice now sued the couple demanding compensation for the dismissal and seeks to claim as much as $350 a day for half a year's life and work at the client's home, to which she was initially hired even without contract.
"I want to show them that such things cannot be done," she said to Post on Friday, adding: "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple retaliated on the allegations of racism by denying this and said that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice from her job because they feared they would not be able to trust her, after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Plascas said, "Post".
"Would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Plascas, who likened the lawsuit to "rape", said that his wife had a baby just two months ago and was "in a very difficult situation".
Are you going to judge that?
This is not a very nice behavior," added an investment banking specialist.
While the court case is being heard, the media hastened to condemn the pair on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel like someone else’s place reading the book for the first time before it was published.
It is now very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's enormous success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before discovering the inspiration to write a book for children about a plush teddy bear, would not have been too upset if his work had been rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release after her father's death was pleasant and at the same time sad.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was quite a quiet person and did not like to brag," she said.
“Because Paddington was so like him himself, he felt like he had a child who got to something: you're proud of him, even though it's not really your job.
I think he was similarly appreciative of Paddington's success story.
Although it was his work and the fruit of his imagination, he always devoted merit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors never managed to save her life.
"Nad has always called and said that the condition is really bad, it is not expected to survive," said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received a call from Nado, who called to say that she had two minutes to live and had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I told her: “Tashi, dear, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctor - given medicines that supported her heart beat slowly ended up in action and disappeared from her body.
She died a little early and it was the end of everything.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn't howl, scream, or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it in me."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, now bereaved by her dead daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers unaware of the difficult test she needed to overcome.
"No one knew," she said.
“My head was lowered and tears crumbled all the time.
It's hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt great pity for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards of mourners aim to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys distribute postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and seek help.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he fell ill with depression, and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want even one father to feel the way I have to feel every day," she said.
A 45-year-old Mr. Davis living in Lidney said her son was a promising chef, distinguished by a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They'd always say his smile sheds light on the room."
However, he quit before he died because he was "really in a dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his suicidal brother.
Mr. Davis said: "I am constantly afraid that a chain reaction may occur."
Mr. Davis developed postcards “to make people know that there are people around them who can be contacted and talked to, even if they are a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to speak."
Mr. Humphreys, a long-time friend of Mr. Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner, Mark, who retired from life not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed, depressed and did not complain about anything," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his changed attitude.
At Christmas, the situation was completely bad: when the children rolled their gifts, he did not look them in the eye and did not react in any way."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they had to overcome it: “In the family it left a void.
It's tearing our heart apart.
However, we all have to live on and fight."

When the FBI opened its investigation, the future of Bretto Kavanaugh fell on the hair
I thought if we could actually get something that he asked for – a study of limited duration and scope – maybe we would bring some unity," Mr.Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was "disappearing" in the strong grip of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their contradiction is determined solely by time.
There are only five weeks left before the mid-term elections, which will take place on November 6, and if the Republicans are expected to turn out poorly, their efforts to elect the desired man to the country's highest court will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators in an effort to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley, Mr. Bush's former personal secretary through him.
What happens when the FBI gives its report?
Voting will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cut ties and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
When Kim came to power, the number of North Korean deserters "diminished"
The South Korean legislature said the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea had fallen when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seugas, citing data from the South Korean Uniting Ministry, said 1,127 defectors were identified last year compared to 2,706 defectors in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors were tighter control of the North Korean-Chinese border and increased human smuggling prices.
Pyongyang did not make public comments.
Many North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang at the center of negotiations that had stalled the negotiations on the surrender of nuclear weapons.
This follows a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when the two largely agreed to seek the Korean Peninsula to become a nuclear-free zone.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of not changing their sanctions since then.
"If there is no trust in the US, we will not be able to trust our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm first," said Mr Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these remarks during an interview he gave at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I simply cannot think that, if a woman did, she would be said to be hysterical," Pelosi expressed his reaction to the testimony given to the Senate Judiciary Committee by Mr Kavanaugh on Thursday.
Mr Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations that he had taken sexual abuse against Dr Christine Blasey Ford when both were still teenagers.
During his opening speech, when he spoke about the family and high school times, Mr Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes beginning to shout or cry out.
He also condemned in full the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him a "grotesque and coordinated destruction of reputation" allegedly organised by the Liberals, who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that the testimony given by Mr Kavanaugh proved that he could not work on the Supreme Court because he revealed his biased attitude towards Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by his statements and the assault on the Clintons and the Democratic Party," she said.
When asked if he would seek to remove Mr Kavanaugh if his candidacy was confirmed and the Democrats in the House of Representatives received a majority of the votes, Pelosi objected.
"I will say yes – if he is lying to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to hold office not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now working," said Mr Pelosi.
Mr Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Ms Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh decisions on the Affordable Health Care Act or in the case Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be reversed.
"This is not the time for us to say: "How wonderful!" – stated N. Pelosi.
The Power Women Should Use
It is a legitimate criticism — eventually spilled months and even years of accumulating fury that it cannot express without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem unusual to me, is it for you?"
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman, a company manager, who told me that she too was crying when she got angry but developed a method: when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to at the time: “You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm actually angry."
And she would just cry on.
It seemed brilliant to me."
Tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most notable memories is from one of the first jobs in the office, where men worked mostly and where I once cried for the unspeakable rage. Then I was grabbed by an older woman, a harsh leader, who I was always a little afraid of, and dragged into the stairwell.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said to me.
- They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to beat you."
Democratic Party congresswoman from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when G. Hart was caught committing adultery on the ship Monkey Business (an aphorism meaning frivolous time spent) and withdrew his candidacy, deeply disappointed Mr. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why he could not stand for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she laughed to me after 30 years.
- By that time there were seven other candidates, so there was no need for another one.
Someone called me "Snow with seven dwarves."
When the campaign began late, there was little time left to raise funds, so she vowed that she would not announce a candidacy until she raised $2 million.
It was an uneventful fight.
She noticed that some supporters who donated $1,000 to men only contributed 250 to her.
“Maybe they thought I was getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave a speech in which she announced that she was launching a formal campaign, she was so engulfed in emotion — gratitude to supporting people, a system of frustration that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and directly reach voters, not representatives, and anger at sexism — that she cried.
“You would have thought that I had nerves,” Mr Schroeder recalled in her press reaction to her speech.
– You would have thought I was supported by the Kleenex napkin business.
I remember thinking about what would be recorded in my grave monument.
"She was crying?"
How the US-China trade generation can benefit Beijing
The first salves in the U.S.–China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, experts say that discord may eventually become beneficial to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave the first warning this year after charging some time earlier on the main Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most notable controversy occurred this week when new tariffs came into force that would affect goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), i.e. in principle half of China's exports to the US will be taxed.
Beijing responded to all the measures at the same time, with the latest decision imposing a five to ten percent duty on American goods with a total value of $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight the US tooth for a tooth, and it seems that this second largest world market is certainly not going to land in the near future.
Washington would only relax sanctions if China complied with the demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its party properly, the difficulties of the trade war with the US may eventually have a positive impact on China as it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
"The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington, D.C. or Beijing can create conditions that would disrupt the economy of both countries is indeed far more dangerous than observers have recognised so far," said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the "Asia New American Security Center".
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to accept returning refugees
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than 7 years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"The progress in the fight against terrorism has made the situation in the territory much more stable and secure," he said.
The government continues its efforts to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists and to restore normality.
All the conditions are already in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave behind because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against daily life and prosperity.
The UN estimates that around 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe picks up the victory of the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team, which defeated the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5:10.5, won the 2018 Ryder Cup at the Le Golf National field next to Paris (France).
The U.S. lost in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the "Ryder" Cup on this continent since 1993.
Europe reclaimed the crown when the team of Danish-born captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, which was enough to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, released a blow from the starting pitch straight into the water at the 16th hole in the 3rd par match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari sparkled in all rounds and became one of four players to achieve a score of 5-0-0 since the tournament gained its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated in 5:4 by lowest ranked European team player Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who has the highest ranking in the world, lost 2:1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cup tournaments, became the tournament's most successful European player of all time, with 25.5 career points.
“I cry very rarely, but I can’t control myself today.
It's been a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm very happy, very happy to have the cup back.
It all depends on the team, and I am glad I could help," said Mrs Garcia in an emotional state after the victory of the Europeans.
He passes the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2:1 game of Sunday units.
"I am incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play," stated Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now he owns the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, winning 14 biggest prizes and landing only for Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team did not succeed in hitting the drive lawn throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showcased a high-profile game throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance of the team: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, there was a certain moment when we began to put pressure on Europeans.
We've been fighting.
I'm raising my hat against Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Let's get your head down.
Our opponents were superior."
