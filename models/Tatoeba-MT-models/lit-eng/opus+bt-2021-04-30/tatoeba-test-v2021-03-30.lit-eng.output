Good morning, it's time to wake up.
The baby was crying all night.
She disliked life in the city.
This size is too big for me.
It won't change anything.
Do as you please.
The man you saw last night is my uncle.
I don't like winter.
I gave Tom a chance.
We played golf despite the rain.
What kind of test is that?
He told me his life story.
I decided to be happy because it's good for my health.
I'll wait here until he gets back.
The teacher teaches.
What do you see in him?
What do you see?
It's not what you think!
You can buy yourself a dog in that parlour.
He likes sweet tea.
You have to do the same thing.
It is simple and intuitive.
How many hours a week do you work?
Yeah, two.
They're not helping.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.
She asked me who came first.
Sooner or later, we'll all die.
How long will it take?
It's a shadow.
Where is the German embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is amazing.
But he knew it couldn't go on.
I guess not.
That's what I want, too!
She's watching but she can't see anything.
He can't eat anything sweet today.
She eats.
I'd like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I got five years in jail.
I'm a loser.
Any universe that is simple enough to understand it is too simple to create a mind that can understand it.
We shouldn't have rushed.
Please?
It doesn't matter which team wins the match.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.
Go and stand by your car.
Bring her a plate of salad.
We are in war.
She didn't answer.
I heard Mary wants a divorce.
Is this stallion or a foal?
My father's coming home tomorrow.
This mountain is covered in snow all year.
Never give up hope.
Can you give me the salt?
This book belongs to the library.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
We make cheese and butter from milk.
When I was in high school, I was up every day at six o'clock in the morning.
You guys are the best shooters.
How can you say something like that?
Be careful!
Obviously you've done this before.
Did you get the letter?
Two years ago, I couldn't play basketball at all.
What's the difference?
You're guilty.
She rejected my request.
Which one do you prefer?
I like Korean food.
I was invited to dinner.
You're still green.
There's nothing here.
You never know what happens in the future.
We made squirrel-shaped cookies.
Everybody loves dolls.
What have you done to deserve this?
Look at the example above.
Her hat looked very funny.
I wanted to become a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We left the door open.
Can you come at 9:00?
Why did you call?
They discussed the problem.
If I hadn't gotten his help, I'd be dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why did you come here?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it strange that Tom's still not here at the moment?
A million people lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence to that on the board.
She met him gladly.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like the way he talks.
I don't know what's going on with me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Do not expect (do not wait) too much.
That brown hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.
Close the gate.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Go back to your seat.
Be friendly.
Isn't that a wonderful morning?
That's a story.
I've got more and more gray hair.
He turned the light off.
I'm sleepless.
The sky is blue.
The old woman fell down and couldn't get up.
After the film, they fell asleep.
You can use my vocabulary.
I want to talk to your uncle.
Tom likes you.
He rarely stays home on Sundays.
When would you like to see him?
Tom started shouting for help.
His son is eight.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he'd be more careful in the future.
At which point did you hear the shot?
I forgot to buy one pillow.
I've heard a lot about you.
We're getting ready to eat lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's the old brainless.
Eat bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Thomas does not speak English.
The school is five kilometers from my home.
I gave up my weapons.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be delicious.
Please come.
Women are changing the world.
In Singapore, spitting on the floor is considered a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on a chair.
We need more sugar.
The smell of roses filled the room.
Evil sometimes wins.
Tom's already had three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're guilty.
What are you looking for there?
What does that mean?
Apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest.
Who's there?
I'm studying Japanese.
It's pointless.
She had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a serpent.
Tell me how you solved that problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I'm afraid of the highlands.
I don't know where to go.
If it doesn't rain, then let's go.
Who's coming with me?
I agree.
Compare the facts.
I'm not hungry right now.
I'm going to France on vacation.
You can sit wherever you want.
You are an engineer.
The door opened slowly.
That's a story.
Did you do any sports?
It's time for you to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
The girl I told you was living here.
Please, just leave.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and see the black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I talked to my friends.
All your cats are gray.
I remember the time when we were having picnics with you.
When we go to bed, we say good night.
The scandal ruined his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that he couldn't even buy bread.
I suggest you ask Thomas.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know I know.
Come home before 6:00.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
Candles lit the room.
I'm sorry.
Fold the paper in half.
What does he write in the letter?
A woman eats bread.
I eat an apple.
A lonely person gets pleasure watching ants.
Who's the man at the other end of the table?
Are you pregnant?
Now I'm really tired.
His steps have accelerated.
The eternal silence of these infinite spaces terrifies me.
Why do you need a new umbrella?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take your hat off when you go into class.
They don't do anything more than complain.
She was in a hurry.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
This is for us.
Listening to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Tom ate the whole pizza alone.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tom.
How are you?
Your journey begins here.
Can you believe what he said?
Thomas asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Tom couldn't stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
At which point should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to a new pardour.
Everyone knows her.
She is incredibly naive.
Where do you live in Turkey?
Tom's gone.
I can't.
Get out of class.
Three dogs sleep on Mom's carpet.
Tom had already finished the job he needed to do.
If you can't have kids, you could always adopt.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Although she ran as fast as she could, she still did not make it to the bus.
They need friends.
Beef, please.
Can you wrap it up like a gift?
You like living like that?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Don't you really have a home?
Are you playing chess?
Her boyfriend is Turk.
Answer me.
My mother can't come.
There are many brewers in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't have a family.
Parents expected too much from their son.
What would you like to order, gentlemen?
He did it.
He entered my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move it!
You can sit on a chair.
Where do you live if you don't have a home?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all students love English.
That test was so heavy that we didn't have enough time to finish it.
That's it.
You have to work fast.
If you believe that society has not produced anything of value, it can be said that you believe in mass destruction as well.
English is spoken around the world.
All their efforts were pointless.
Where's the mirror?
This girl sings pretty good.
Life is dishonest.
Every person paid a thousand dollars.
Jill is the only girl in our club.
Students do not have to go to school today.
The sun's gone by the cloud.
His parents were pleased with his success.
It's our home now.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get home.
He helped fix my watch.
Nobody made you help me.
John doesn't know what to do next.
He suffered from severe headaches.
I want a dog.
I have to find my pen.
Nigeria was once a British colony.
Don't throw stones at the river.
I'm good at German.
She paints her room in white.
I can't go until he comes.
I invited her to dance.
Have you done your homework yet?
John is a professor of French literature at Oxford University.
Do you understand what he said?
What color is her hair?
The sooner you get back, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to begin your journey?
Your watch is ten minutes late.
They tricked you.
I thought you said it was yours.
How much money do you have hidden under your bed?
We believe in God.
I'm Irish.
Here's the man I've been waiting for.
He didn't pay off the debt and disappeared.
Mr. Brown speaks Japanese very well.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I like to watch baseball and football.
Everyone except her smiled.
The queen stood by the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She's my first love.
You have to keep your promise.
Tom looks different today.
What is the price of the room rental?
We have to get out of here.
Tom doesn't want to do it again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How long have you started learning Esperant language?
They're not a threat.
Her advice encouraged me to go abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places does the tour visit?
It started to rain hard, which is why we were playing inside.
Your carpet is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't meet you tonight.
Tom has a sister who is a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
Tonight you look just charming.
Doc, can you listen to me?
You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom changed his clothes.
The oven is hot, so be careful not to burn.
Did you find your letters?
For God's sake!
He doesn't remember whether that room was empty or not.
The store sells expensive accessories for women.
I don't like to be wrong.
It's not theirs.
I'm not used to getting up early.
Stay where you are.
The house is hers.
The doctor advised him to stop working so much.
Are you sure?
You were busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He'll do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What kind of music does Tom like?
That tree grows by her house.
Don't talk in the reading room.
How are you doing, miss?
I exchanged yen for dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Tom's going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where'd you curse them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time right now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This carpet is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why isn't anyone eating my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She literally translated it.
What a great night!
I can't find Tim.
She called him Charles.
I'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She takes them to school.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
No one believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the hearing.
I don't want to be indebted to anyone.
Look at the train running over the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I'm really bored now.
No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I'm twenty-five.
Her hat looked funny.
Don't scold her, she's too young to understand.
I bought this suit for this very occasion.
It's similar.
Be careful, okay?
That's the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Don't you know the way?
I like that very much.
Tom's gonna need help.
I printed a hundred pages.
I can see and hear.
Don't forget the ticket.
Raise your hand before answering.
Please change the flag.
Isn't it true you have a gun?
I was in bed all day yesterday.
The war ended their investigation.
When spring comes, days become a longer day after day.
I'm listening to the radio.
Sweet dreams!
Leave my car alone.
This is Tony's book.
I should have come earlier.
Tom only eats what he wants to eat.
Who stole this apple?
He lost his ticket to the cinema.
What would you do if you were in his place?
I don't like summer.
By the way, what's your address?
She lay on the bed face down.
African elephants are larger than Asian elephants.
That's what I always said.

Eat bread!
If God did not exist, we would have to create him.
You should do it yourself this time.
My family was very hospitable to me.
You don't understand.
She has green eyes and light brown hair.
Does Tom have any experience?
She left her umbrella on the train.
I'm a vegetarian.
You have to go there.
What's the reason?
I don't see anything from here.
Since I didn't get an answer, I wrote her again.
She's standing outside the wall.
Don't expect too much from me.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I drank one beer and pretended to be very drunk.
Tom didn't think he needed a bodyguard.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her enter the park.
It doesn't sound like you're busy.
It didn't look like you wanted that book.
I have a red bike.
It's low and thick.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The trip was frustrating.
He's a lot smarter than me.
Tom still doesn't seem interested.
Today the weather is terrible.
I didn't want this to happen.
The dog is trying to break free.
Like I said, I'm not doing anything.
Afterwards, there is a small brown puppy in the tables.

Camels are often used to travel in deserts.

Have a good weekend.
I saw his car through the window.
Are you ready?
I'm happy I'm not a woman.
Take your time off and get back to work.
The more, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is that your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
It is quite normal to want to be happy.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
I had a pain in my hand last night.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
I don't have a computer at home.

Can you give me a discount?
She kissed my cheek and wished me good night.
My friend is here.
Where do you live now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn a language.
Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not all people like dogs.
I'll stay here for a few days.
I don't feel good.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that true?
She's crying.
I'll see you in hell.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.

Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You shouldn't be swimming in that pond.
When will the snow melt?
He was wondering who I was really tired of.
I think she doesn't want to eat anymore.
Either you're with us or you're against us.
Please help me, I'm dying!
Tom knows Mary likes it.
I like this music.
She's scared of a dog.
He went to the pardour, but stopped at her house.
The snow is falling fast.
We're having lunch here.
Of course I should read this book.

The result was disappointing.
I stepped in through the window.
The meat's not ready yet.
Give me a piece of chalk.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
It's dark, would you turn the light on?
He doesn't trust the doctor anymore.
This was the first time I've visited a museum.
We had a great time.
I think Tom's gonna want to sit down.
What a great family.
Are you still in Florida?
You shouldn't have eaten that raw fish.
Tomorrow is the last day.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
Stockholm is the capital of Sweden.
They talked about love.
Tom doesn't want to do it again.
I don't understand.
Left alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team lacked mobility.
The cat crossed the street.
There's a mirror out there.
Why don't you want to help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please continue.
He was busy.
I'm a widow.
I saw him.
I'm learning Lozhban.
"Good morning," said Thomas smiling.

Are you busy right now?
I take back everything I said.
Where do you have all those keys from?
I got inside the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He hastened our names.
Our son died during the war.
He is dissatisfied with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't tell you who's coming first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
We may as well all go
Who's that person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They go shopping.
Everything that is brilliant is simple.
Her students learn too much.
Tom raised his hand.
Put your shoes on, let's go to lunch.
The birds flew south.
This tea is very delicious.
I don't agree with him.
I'm guilty.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
This is a wonderful idea.
He's very proud of his toy.
That will be enough for us for now.
I'm not afraid at all.
A woman wants to know the truth.
Is the word often used?

You know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her cat lay on my pillow and didn't want to come off.
There are several good hotels in the city.
What is this letter from?
He doesn't want to learn today.
We're all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life's fun.
She's here?
I don't like to be wrong.
Be careful, okay?
I bought a camera for thirty dollars.
That's great.
It's no method, it's provocation.
Answer in English.

I fell off the ladder.
He knows how to interrogate people.
Bob was washing the dishes at the time.

I'm thinking about you.
What's your home address?
He'll be free tomorrow.
Have you seen my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Tom will die soon.
I'm used to going to bed late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with a red roof.
My apartment's on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We are basketball players.
These clothes are good for you.
Don't blame her.
Do you know you're stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care about him.
Thomas could not find a reason why he had to return home early.
Raise your hand.
He didn't sell home.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw someone waiting for her at school.
It doesn't sound like you're busy.
Where's Maria?
A new contract allows us to demand whatever we want.
Thomas is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I said I'm gonna hire another catras later.
God help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs him more than he needs her.
Have fun!
Tom, I'm back.
You wanted to see me?
This is not a mistake.
