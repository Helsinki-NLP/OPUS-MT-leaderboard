Did Tom forgive you for what you did last week?
Good morning, it's time to wake up.
The baby was crying all night.
She didn't like living in the city.
This size is too big for me.
It won't change anything.
Do whatever you want.
The man you saw last night is my uncle.
I don't like winter.
I gave Tom a chance.
We played golf despite the rain.
What kind of test is that?
He told me his life story.
I decided to be happy because it was good for my health.
I'll wait here until he comes back.
The teacher teaches.
What do you see in it?
What do you see?
It's not what you think!
You can buy a dog in that barn.
He likes sweet tea.
You have to do the same thing.
It is simple and intuitive.
How many hours a week do you work?
Yeah, two.
They're not helping.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.
She asked me who came first.
Sooner or later, we'll all die.
How long will it take?
It's a shadow.
Where is the German Embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is amazing.
But he knew it couldn't go on.
Probably not.
I want it too!
She's watching but she can't see anything.
He can't eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I'd like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I've been in prison for five years.
I'm a loser.
Any universe that is simple enough to understand it is too simple to create a mind that can understand it.
We shouldn't have rushed.
Please?
It doesn't matter which team wins the match.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.
Go and stand by your car.
Bring her a plate of salads.
We are in war.
She didn't answer.
I heard Mary wanted a divorce.
Is it a stallion or a foal?
My father's coming home tomorrow.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
Never lose hope.
Can you give me the salt?
This book belongs to the library.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
We make cheese and butter from milk.
When I was in high school, I was up every day at 6: 00 a.m.
You guys are the best shooters.
How can you say something like that?
Be careful!
Obviously you've done this before.
Did you get the letter?
Two years ago, I couldn't play basketball at all.
What's the difference?
It's your fault.
She rejected my request.
Which one do you prefer?
I like Korean food.
I was invited to dinner.
You're still green.
There's nothing here.
You never know what's going to happen in the future.
We made squirrel-shaped cookies.
Everybody likes dolls.
What have you done to deserve this?
Look at the example above.
Her hat looked very funny.
I wanted to be a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We left the door open.
Can you come back at 9:00?
Why did you call?
They discussed the problem.
If I hadn't received his help, I would have been dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why did you come here?
Do you like that color?
Isn't it strange that Tom isn't here yet?
A million people lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence with that on the board.
She met him joyfully.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like the way he talks.
I don't know what's going on with me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Don't expect too much.
That brown hat is old.
He's playing golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.
Close the gate.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Go back to your seat.
Be friendly.
Isn't that a beautiful morning?
That's a story.
I have more and more gray hairs.
He turned off the light.
I'm not sleeping.
The sky is blue.
The old woman fell and couldn't get up.
After the movie, they fell asleep.
You can use my dictionary.
I want to talk to your uncle.
Tom likes you.
He rarely stays home on Sundays.
When would you like to see him?
Tom began to cry out for help.
His son is eight.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he'd be more cautious in the future.
When did you hear a shot?
I forgot to buy a pillow.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't go now, we're going to eat lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's an old man's brainless.
Eat bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Tom does not speak English.
The school is five kilometers from my home.
I gave up my weapons.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be good.
Please come.
Women are changing the world.
In Singapore, spitting on the floor is considered a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on the chair.
We need more sugar.
Rose's smell filled the room.
Evil sometimes wins.
Tom already had three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
It's your fault.
What are you looking for?
What does that mean?
Apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest.
Who's there?
I'm studying Japanese.
It's pointless.
She had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a serpent.
Tell me how you solved that problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I'm afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If it's not raining, then let's go.
Who's coming with me?
I agree.
Compare the facts.
I'm not hungry right now.
I'm going to France on vacation.
You can sit wherever you want.
You're an engineer.
The door opened slowly.
That's a story.
Did you do any sports?
It's about time you started a new business.
Let's wait here.
The girl I told you about lives here.
Please, just leave.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and see the black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I talked to my friends.
All your cats are gray.
I still remember the times when you and I held picnics together.
When we go to bed, we say good night.
Scandal ruined his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor he couldn't even buy bread.
I suggest you ask Thomas.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know I know.
Go home before 6:00 a.m.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The candles lit the room.
I'm sorry.
Fold the paper in half.
What does he write in the letter?
A woman eats bread.
I eat an apple.
A lonely person gets the pleasure of watching ant.
Who's the man at the other end of the table?
Are you pregnant?
Now I'm really tired.
His steps have accelerated.
The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.
Why do you need a new umbrella?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take off your hat when you get into class.
They don't do anything more than complain.
She was in a hurry.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
This is for us.
I'm listening to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Tom ate the whole pizza alone.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tom.
How are you?
Your journey starts here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Tom couldn't stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late on the bus.
All apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
How long should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to the new barn.
Everyone knows her.
She's incredibly naive.
Where do you live in Turkey?
Tom's gone.
I can't.
Get out of class.
Three dogs sleep on mom's carpet.
Tom had already finished the job he needed to do.
If you can't have kids, you could always adopt.
That's exactly what I thought.
Although she ran as fast as she could, she still missed the bus.
They need friends.
Beef, please.
Can you wrap it up as a gift?
Do you like living like that?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Are you sure you don't have a home?
Are you playing chess?
Her boyfriend is Turk.
Answer me.
My mother can't come.
There are many brewers in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't have a family.
My parents expected too much of their son.
What would you like to order, gentlemen?
He did it.
He entered my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move it!
You can sit on the chair.
Where do you live if you don't have a home?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all students like English.
That test was so heavy that we didn't have enough time to finish it.
That's it.

Do you understand what he said?
What color is her hair?
The sooner you return, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to start your journey?
Your watch is ten minutes late.
They tricked you.
I thought you said it was yours.
How much money do you have hidden under your bed?
We believe in God.
I'm Irish.
There's the man I've been waiting for.
He didn't pay the debt and he disappeared.
Mr Brown speaks very well in Japanese.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I like to watch baseball and football.
Everyone but her smiled.
The Queen stood by the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She's my first love.
You have to keep your promise.
Tom looks different today.
What is the price of room rental?
We have to get out of here.
Tom doesn't want to do it again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How long have you been learning Esperanto?
They're not a threat.
Her advice moved me to travel abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places does the tour visit?
That's why we were playing inside.
Your carpet is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't see you tonight.
Tom has a sister who is a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
Tonight, you look just charming.
Doctor, can you listen to me?
You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom changed his clothes.
The oven is hot, so be careful not to burn.
Did you find your letters?
For God's sake!
He doesn't remember whether that room was empty or not.
The store sells expensive accessories for women.
I don't like to be wrong.
It's not theirs.
I'm not used to getting up early.
Stay where you are.
The house is hers.
The doctor advised him to stop working so much.
Are you sure?
You were busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He'll do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What kind of music does Tom like?
That tree grows next to her house.
Don't talk to me in the reading room.
How are you doing, miss?
I exchanged yen for dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Tom's going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where did you curse them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told me a funny story.
I don't have time right now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This carpet is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why don't anybody eat my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She literally translated it.
It's a great night!
I can't find Tim.
She called him Charles.
I'm not sure it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She's taking them to school.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
Nobody believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the question.
I don't want to be in debt to anyone.
Look at the train crossing the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I'm really bored right now.
No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I'm ten-five.
Her hat looked funny.
She's too young to understand.
I bought this suit for this very occasion.
That's similar.
Be careful, okay?
That's the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm actually here.
Don't you know the way?
I love that very much.
Tom's gonna need some help.
I printed a hundred pages.
I can see and hear.
Don't forget the ticket.

She has green eyes and light brown hair.
Does Tom have any experience?
She left her umbrella on the train.
I'm a vegetarian.
You definitely have to go there.
What's the reason?
I can't see anything from here.
Because I didn't get an answer, I wrote her again.
She's standing behind the wall.
Don't expect too much of me.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I had a beer and I pretended to be very drunk.
Thomas didn't think he needed a bodyguard.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her enter the park.
It doesn't seem like you're busy.
It didn't look like you wanted that book.
I have a red bike.
It's low and thick.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The trip was frustrating.
He's much smarter than me.
Tom still doesn't seem interested.
Today's weather is terrible.

Are you ready?
I'm happy I'm not a woman.
Slay your time and get back to work.
The more, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
To be happy is normal.
We need to move very carefully.

Not all people like dogs.
I'll stay here for a few days.

Why did you say this stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that true?
She's crying.
See you in hell.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took the family to the zoo.

Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You shouldn't swim in that pond.
When will the snow melt?
He was thinking who I was very tired of.
I think she doesn't want to eat anymore.
Either you're with us or you're against us.
Please help me, I'm dying!
Tom knows that Mary likes it.
I like this music.
She's scared of the dog.
He went to the barn, but stood by her house.
Snow's falling fast.
We're having lunch here.
Of course I should read this book.
Tom is not in prison at the moment.
Tom and Mary went to the museum.
The ship's gone beyond the horizon.
Good morning, my sweet dog.

Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
It's dark, would you like to turn the light on?
He doesn't trust a doctor anymore.
It was the first time I visited the museum.
We had a great time.
I think Tom's gonna want to sit down.
What a great family.
Are you still in Florida?
You shouldn't have eaten that green fish.
Ready, tomorrow is the last day.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
Stockholm is the capital of Sweden.
They talked about love.
Tom doesn't want to do it again.
I don't understand.
Left alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team lacked mobility.
The cat crossed the street.
There's a mirror.
Why don't you want to help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please continue.
He was busy.
I'm a widow.
I saw him.
I'm learning Lozhban.
"Good morning," said Tom smiling.
My hand hurts.

You shouldn't trust him.
One week is seven days.
You have to walk your own way of life.

Are you busy right now?
I'm taking back everything I said.
Where do you get all those keys?
I entered the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly wrote down our names.
Our son died in the war.
He is dissatisfied with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't tell you who's coming first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
We may as well all go
Who's that person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going shopping.
Everything that is brilliant is simple.
Her students are learning too much.
Tom raised his hand.
Let's go to dinner.
The birds flew south.
This tea is delicious.
I disagree with him.
I'm guilty.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
This is a wonderful idea.
He's very proud of his toy.
That is enough for us now.
I'm not afraid at all.
A woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania joins the European Union.
I want to be a linguist.
Where is the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She became a mailman.
I learned how to ride a bicycle when I was six years old.
He took a piece of chalk.
Let me do it.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and let in some fresh air.
Have you ever sewed a button?
It's heavy snowing.
Have you seen my mother?
I know his name.
Tom doesn't want to live like that.
Do you agree with what she's doing?
He came here before the end of class.
You know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his filthy shoes.
Her cat was lying on my pillow and didn't want to come down.
There are some good hotels in the city.
What's this letter from?
He doesn't want to learn today.
We're all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like to be wrong.
Be careful, okay?
I bought a camera for 30 bucks.
That's great.
It's no method, it's provocation.
Answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
The water here is very shallow.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.

I'm thinking about you.
What's your home address?
He'll be free tomorrow.
Have you seen my wife?
Your daughter heard us speak.
Tom's gonna die soon.
I'm used to going to bed late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with a red roof.
My apartment's on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We're basketball players.
These clothes are good for you.
Don't blame her.
Do you know you're stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care about him.
Thomas could not find a reason why he had to go home early.
Raise your hand.
He didn't sell home.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw someone waiting for her at school.
It doesn't seem like you're busy.
Where's Maria?
The new contract allows us to demand whatever we want.
Tom is still a prisoner.
Go open the door.
I said I'd hire another cat later.
God help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs him more than he needs her.
Have fun!
Tom, I'm back.
You wanted to see me?
This is not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city centre.
