Ethical Guardians: Liberal Movement Board on the Action of Vilnius Division Right
"The decisions taken by the Board shall be in accordance with the articles of association," the head of the Commission Vytautas Tamošiūnas informed the BNS after the meeting.
"Our decision was not something new.
The interpretation as the Commission had already done in July when the question was raised about Pagėgiai and Utena.
We then said that, according to the statute, this was a matter of the board's competence.
And if the board decides that some department can do what it wants - go with the committee and the board agrees, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then it is the decision that all units form party lists.
And if you do not agree with the board, then it is possible to suspend membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, the Board of the Party will now decide on further actions.
On 17 October, the Liberal Movement Board of the Party cancelled the decision of the Vilnius City Department to participate in municipal elections not with the party's list, but with the newly formed election committee.
In the opinion of the Party Board, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in elections in the form of a public election committee violated the statutes of the party and decisions of the board.
By October 31, Vilnius Division had to withdraw its aspirations to participate in municipal elections with the list of the committee.
But the department didn't do it.
Aušrinė Armonaitė, former head of the unit, has already withdrawn from the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, former Chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, who promises to reach the office of another head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, which we are proud of!"
He left the party, too.
Elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place in March next year.
The villagers in Northern India ran a tractor on a tiger that had previously tore a man, reported on Monday by the officials.
The forest officer Mahavir Kaujlagi (Mahavir Kaujlagi) said that the tiger killed the man who worked in the fields late on Sunday, the villagers surrounded the beast and, when the female tried to escape, drove her on a tractor.
Residents say that some 10 days ago this tiger also attacked and killed a young man.
The village is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in the Lakhympur Kheri District, approximately 250 km southeast of the State of Utar Pradesh, Laknau.
The killing of tigers in protected areas shall be prohibited.
The Director of the Disciplinary Order, Ramesh Pandey, said that the case would be reported to the police in accordance with the Wildlife Conservation Act.
In April, villagers in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh struck another tiger, who suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is an Indian national animal; according to the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are regarded as a endangered species.
Last year’s government figures show that during the previous three years, at least one person was killed every day in encounters with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with tigers have gradually increased since the 1970s, when India launched a tiger protection programme that has established reserves in national parks, and the practice of big cat scarfing has become a crime.
Although the methods used to calculate tigers have changed, the census would indicate that the population of approximately 1,800 tigers then grew to 2, 226 individuals in 2014.
The mandatory use of microchips for cats and dogs is proposed
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, together with other Seimas Members, registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, which proposed mandatory marking of cats and dogs with subcutaneous chips.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be labelled with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and labelling would be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge with public funds, and in 2020 also cats will be labelled, so the residents will not be concerned and the costs will be covered by the specially planned state funding," said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for the labelling of domestic animals.
This is expected to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is estimated that all owners of animals will be compensated during the transitional period on the basis of the expected average cost of the microchip and the service, which will amount to about EUR 5.
The total cost of labelling all pets can be up to €6 million.
The need for these funds is expected to be spread over three years and will amount to EUR 2 million per year.
It is expected that labelling programmes will receive funding through the Municipal Environmental Support Special Programme, whose revenues will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and reallocation of funds.
The municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for cat and dog labelling, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to K. Mažeika, the practice of compulsory labelling is widespread in almost all European Union countries, which allows to protect the animals themselves (because lost animals can easily be returned to the owners) and saves the time of the animal breeders themselves when the search of the escaped and lost pet takes a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only possible with labelled pets.
At the same time, labelling obliges the animal to take responsible care of his life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling were opposed, as the programmes concerned were proposed to be financed by the public.
"The model now being presented should avoid these criticisms, as animal protection is proposed to be financed by increased income in the environmental promotion programme and the right to label not only to veterinarians but also to publicists, i.e. persons in animal care institutions who have received special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the project said.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas Members representing different parliamentary groups - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 members of government forces were killed in the Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
Arif Noori, spokesperson of the Provincial Governor, indicated that seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four more soldiers were injured during the attack on the joint army and police control post in the Chogyani District.
According to A. Noori, during a three-hour battle with Afghan forces six fighters were killed and another ten Taliban were injured.
Taliban spokesperson for the Taliban Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement to the media in which the movement assumes responsibility for Monday's attack on Ghazni Province.
A. Noori said that this post was installed two days ago in a strategically important area in order to cut off the Taliban supply route.
During the attack, the post was completely destroyed.
"East" extended a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will be held in Vilnius "East" Arena, where Kosovo and Ukraine clubs will meet.
The duel will be held in the capital for political reasons.
On the 7th of November, Vilnius Rytas, who has a warm relationship with Ukrainian basketball, will host the teams of Cherkaski Mavpy and Priština KB Prishtina from Cherkaski Mavpy, under its roof in Rytas Arena.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we could not hold this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to welcome us," Head coach of the Ukrainian team Maxim Michelson thanked "East".
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope that we will receive support from the Vilnius people.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine because these countries have no diplomatic relations.
At present, the Ukrainian crew after the first circle occupies a third place with one victory in three meetings, while the Kosovan team is in the second position and has more victory.
This will be an extremely important point of reference for Group E, as only two teams will go to the next stage.
In the past, Ukraine's and Kosovo's national teams also took part in the European Basketball Championship 2017.
Then 100:61 victory was celebrated by the Ukrainian team.
Basketball fans will be able to get to the matches on Wednesday for free, and the duel will start at 19:00.
"Women lie better" the star actress Arsobaitė is being persecuted by liars
It's probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaitė already gets some roles related to liars.
At first, the series "Women lie better", then the performance "Melagės" and finally the comedy "Melagiai".
In this movie, Brigita plays the square wife of the hero of Dainius Kazlauskas.
"I really liked to be in Melagiai, because I'm more of a theatre actress and I don't appear in the cinema very rarely.
A wonderful team of colleagues from the beginning promised an excellent result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the court was the puppy Sunny!
All my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would be really big and serious.
I've never been fascinated by those little, decorative, four-legged fifes.
But during the filming Sunny got so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the host woman, but without success," the actress smiles.
The new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai", which was produced by Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov, the producer of Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Among ours, boys..." has been inserted into the comical and intriguing rehearsals of family members from the first minutes.
Your love just reported, she's pregnant.
That would be good news, but... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that is not all.
Before they announce the "good news" to everyone, the parents suddenly state - they are different!
50 years later, together...
And all this is happening just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - Christmas!
But the end will surprise us even more, for no one expected such a setback.
All heroes are not what they looked like at first sight...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė's comedy Melagiai four-generation film stars will present a good mood to the audience: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
"Melagiai" comedy - in movies from 9 November.
Deciding to write off €100 million of unpaid taxes on emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the Law on Declaration of the Place of Residence, prepared by the leader of the peasant Ramūnas Karbauskas.
56 Members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstained.
Further consideration of the amendments will be taken by the Seimas on 6 December or later, subject to the Government's conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskas, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, in three years one person fails to pay about EUR 1 000, and now there are about 100 000.
The Social Democrat Algirdas Syss regretted that in this way the Seimas will "ask some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be charged.
Conservatoire Antanas Matulas, a member of the Committee on Health Affairs, noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that they come to Lithuania for medical treatment by paying a small health insurance fee and receive the same services as residents paying the tax.
The amendments provide that those persons who will pay social insurance contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation would be considered to be those who left Lithuania, and Sodra will have exempted them from health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the president of "Sodra", said earlier that such a step would make life easier for the people who have emigrated and for the activities of "Sodra".
A video on the Internet about a slippery bear reveals a serious problem
The mother bear is filmed as she climbs a steep snowy slope, and the baby climbs, slips down, and climbs hard again.
The video received many views and comments.
People admired the perseverance of the little bear - repeatedly slipping down, he climbed back to his mother.
He does not succeed at the first time, but he does not even try to give up, and he finally achieves his goal.
The video really belonged to the attention, but it also reveals the threat that humans pose to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to get to know nature in the wild can sometimes be harmful.
"It's obvious to me that the bear drone was terrified.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If the drone had not flown around, they would probably have chosen a safer path, or they would have made it slower or more cautious.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," said Ecologist Mark Ditmer to The Verge.
Some time ago, Ditmer and his colleagues studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were equipped with heart - working gauges.
When the drone approached some bears to run, others did not run anywhere, but the hearts of all of them began to beat more often.
Scientists recommend that animals use drones responsibly, not to fly too close, not to make noise, or to fly where it is forbidden.
The runaway president was approached through the newspaper
On Tuesday, the Kiev Court invited the deposed President Viktor Yanukovych, who had left Russia, to attend the hearing of the case concerning the extradition of his alleged state in an unusual way - he announced his summons in the State Official Gazette.
In the summons published in the Government News newspaper Uradovo kurier, the former leader is invited to attend the hearing of criminal proceedings on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Yanukovych has the right to attend the video hearing.
On 30 October, the Kiev Court announced that it had closed the debate in the Yanukovych case.
V. Janukovich's lawyer Aleksandras Gorošinskis, working in Russia, was given the opportunity to register in the Register of Foreign Advocates before 19 November, so that he could attend a meeting where V. Janukovich is expected to speak his last word by video.
Under the auspices of the Kremlin, Yanukovich was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign the Treaty of Association with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former leader of Ukraine was taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, and later in the east of the country a war broke out between Kiev and Russian supported separatists.
Since then, the battle has killed some 10 000 people, despite many attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunsk will lead the list of conservatives to Vilnius City Council
Former Minister of Economy, Parliamentary Dainius Kreivys, has already been approved as a Conservative candidate for the year.
During the first elections of the Conservatives during the weekend, the members of the party rated the list of candidates for the City Council of Vilnius.
According to the party, V. Benkunsk, Chairman of the Vilnius Department Conference, became the leader of the list of conservatives.
The first ten candidates were Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adamas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaisys, Rasa Baškienė, former member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the Young Conservative League Mantas Benkunsk, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazikaitė.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils will take place in Lithuania on 3 March next year.
Limitations of combined power plants under appeal to the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) against the decision of the ruling to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Seimas Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of Seimas Members applied to the KT to investigate the conformity of the adopted amendments to the Law on Waste Management with the Constitution.
"Parliamentarians stress that the provisions of the law are aimed at questioning the projects of waste incineration plants already in operation by entrusting the Government with the task of imposing new restrictions (20 km from the territory of residence) until the entry into force of the law on waste incineration plants started in Vilnius and Kaunas," the report says.
"Parliamentarians note that in view of the way the law formulated the prohibition on the construction of objects of national importance for waste management (i.e. the distance determined and the definition of the concept of "residential area"), it must be concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately limited or even denied the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, since the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, after assessing the density and distribution of the population of Lithuania in the country, it would be practically impossible to build such objects in the entire territory of the country," he adds.
The appeal states that the adopted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The CTA has repeatedly stated that the legal acts shall not apply to those legal facts and consequences which occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted legal act.
In this case, the Government shall be granted powers to apply the law retroactively on the basis of an undefined criterion.
Such legal regulation violates constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law", - indicates the appeal.
It also notes that major financial investments have already been made in the projects of the combined power plants in Vilnius and Kaunas.
Stopping the projects currently under way would not only cause hundreds of millions of financial losses, it would also cause huge losses for Lithuanians - heating prices would increase, and the increase in landfill waste would increase environmental pollution.
The application to the CC was signed by members from the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic Groups and the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group, deputy elder Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes in the votes of those in power in order to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaite, which provided for the right of the Government to suspend the construction of co-generation plants already started, and also established a zone of 20 km from residential areas "quarantine" for the construction of such plants.
Amendments to the Law, which have been repeatedly adopted by the Seimas, will enter into force on 1 January 2019.
It is planned to consider this proposal at the Seimas autumn session.
However, the right of the Government to suspend projects already started is not planned.
The CT will deal with this case in the order of priority - not earlier than after a year.
Publicizes LeBron James' statistics at Lakers Club
The beginning of LeBron James' career at the Los Angeles Lakers club is not what he expected, the organization and basketball fans.
Lakers started the season with four victories and six defeats, and such a weak start led to rumours due to the possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, such talks were reassured by the basketball operations president, Magitz Johnson, who stated that he would not forgive the coach, but that he needed to play better.
The biggest team star, L. James, should look back on himself.
Although the attacker's statistics are usually impressive - 26,8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 outputs.
However, she does not tell the whole truth.
During the first ten matches of the season, other figures show that Lakers play better when there is no James in the square.
The attacker is unfavorable +/- statistics showing how many points he throws in or skips the crew when there are certain players in the square.
Here, when L. James is in the square, Lakers spent 30 points more in this season than the rivals.
As he sat on the bench, the lakemen scored 19 points more than the rivals.
Currently, Lakers at the Western Conference is in only 13th place, but several victories can turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the airspace protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania highly appreciates Spanish cooperation in NATO and its significant contribution to the security of our country and region," Minister Linkevičius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already performed NATO Air Policing and Air Policing strengthening missions in the Baltic States five times, including three times in Lithuania.
The last time the Spanish Eurofighter fighters were deployed in Šiauliai in May-August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the airspace protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations are held between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda.
Linkevičius expressed his hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to work closely together on European, transatlantic agendas and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is Spain's fifth representative in Lithuania.
On October 29, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented letters of credence to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. Ačienė on the Detention of R. Ačas: I believe in my husband’s innocence and law enforcement
"For me, it was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, the services probably do the work they have to do.
We're all doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement, believe my husband that everything is fair and honest, that no dishonest actions should be done", said V. Ačienė.
R. Ačas Special Investigation Service (STT) has been detained on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still director of Raseiniai municipality administration, took a bribe of high value, and in return he could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed an agreement with Raseiniai bus fleet managed by the municipality.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of having bribed Mr Ača directly or of participating in various financial transactions masking bribes.
Raseiniai district municipal council R. Ača was dismissed from the office of the head of administration by the third attempt in April of this year after the expressed distrust.
The former "governance" became a member of the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas in March of this year, and he suspended his membership in this party on Monday.
Several years ago, he was unsuccessfully candidate in the mayor elections as a representative of the election committee 'Your Raseiniai'.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to stand for his candidacy in the mayor of Raseiniai next year, but had not yet decided whether he would participate in the municipal council elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of the Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union and is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she'll be waiting for further law enforcement action, depending on whether she gets away from work in the commission.
"I really don't make big decisions today, this week, I think I'll decide.
I will see if there is a need, what accusations have been made, I will, of course, make a decision in one way or another.
Perhaps I need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - the time will put everything in place," she said.
The representative of opposition conservatives Seime Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė urged the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckienis and the Head of the "valsticians" Ramūnas Karbauskas to dissociate from the statements of the group's colleague Vida Ačiene and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by transferring her to another Seimas committee or commission.
She claims that further work by V. Ačiene in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission would "circumstrate public mistrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervisory commission".
Sensitive Coldplay music has also attracted famous Lithuanian couples
On Monday evening, a lot of music and movie lovers gathered for the premiere of the film Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
The event was attended by a group of people known: John and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Silas and many others.
The film tells the story of one of Britain's most popular sub-proco groups, Coldplay, which intertwins with the moments from the concerts.
The documentary director Mat Whitecross met the group's guys before they played in bars and gathered only a few dozen spectators.
In the film you can see still unproven shots from the backstage of concerts, rehearsals or leisure.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in 1996 in college and founded a group "Pectoralz".
Soon thereafter, the bassist Guy Berryman joined them, and a little later, drummer Will Champion.
The group changed its name to Coldplay, and exactly twenty years ago it released its first record, Safety, containing three tracks.
Of the 500 copies of the record, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of Safety were traded.
Now Coldplay is a world-famous, respected and beloved group that has released seven albums, more than 100 million copies of which have been sold.
In two decades the group has won 107 different awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammy.

A Palestinian man with a knife attacked Israelis on the West Bank
The soldier 'preceded this attack because he identified a terrorist who attempted to strike civilians with a knife and an IDF (Israeli Defence Force) officer', according to a report distributed by the Israeli army on the incident at Kirjat Arba's nauseum near Hebron.
"The soldier fired a terrorist and neutralized it.
He was taken to the hospital.
The Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers did not suffer," the report adds.
The military spokesperson for the news agency AFP said that he was trying to organise a Palestinian attack.
After the incident, the video shows that he was easily injured.
A similar wave of Palestinian attacks started in 2015.
Such attacks have declined in recent years, but there are fears that a new wave of attacks may arise.
On October 22th, a Palestinian was shot, and a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron were shot with a knife.
Grybauskaite calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for European Union (EU) countries' investments and to facilitate foreign import conditions.
During the opening of the Trade and Investment Forum at the China Import Exhibition in Shanghai, Grybauskaite stressed that, in view of the signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to 'unify efforts to counter the spread of protectionism in the world', addressing the root causes of the tensions caused by trade wars, 'overproduction and unfair competition'.
'The European Union attaches great importance to China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment, which is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Dalia Grybauskaitė said.
According to her, China's opening up is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The President underlined that transparency of investments should be "above the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be essential to the environment of new investment relations," Dalia Grybauskaitė stressed.
"Corrupted capital flows should not be expected in any country of the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import exhibition tries to mitigate criticism that avoids opening up its market and defends only its own companies.
The exhibition is attended by heads of several states, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Last year Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50%, which amounted to EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investment in Lithuania can bring undesired political influence, while Beijing's exclusive attention to Eastern Europe divides the unity of the EU.

The causes of the Lion Air crash have been revealed: the loved ones of the dead are angry
Data from the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air's liner black box show that during at least the last four of its flights, the speed gauge was disrupted, reported by the investigators on Monday.
Chairman of the National Transport Safety Committee (NTSC) Soerian Tjahion said that a similar incident occurred during the last four aircraft flights, including the fatal one, when the liner fell in the Java Sea on 29 October immediately after the Jakarta take-off.
All 189 people on the plane were killed in this crash.
A lot of media reported problems during the previous flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the capital of Indonesia.
"When we opened the black box - yes, indeed, the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," said Mr Tjahion at a press conference.
"Black box data showed that in two flights against the flight Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
"There are many rumours in social networks.
Now we want to explain that there were four flights in the black box (remaining data) during which there were problems with the airspeed meter," stated the head of the NTSC.
During a meeting with family members, Mr Tjahion said that the information of the device recording flight data corresponds to reports that the speed and altitude of the last flight changed irregularly after the aeroplane took off.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air indicated that during the flight from Bali to Jakarta it had been repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the founders of the company Rusdi Kirana was not invited to speak to the Minister of Transport and Communications Budi Karya Sumadi, who moderated the meeting of family members with officials supervising the search for aircraft and remains of victims and the investigation of the disaster.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Mr Kirana, together with his brother Cusnan, founded Lion Air in 1999, introduce herself.
Lion Air did not behave properly," said a man who presented himself as the father of a passenger named Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on an island on which the plane flew.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
- Lion Air has never met me since the beginning of the crisis.
We lost our child, but Lion Air did not show us any compassion."
After this meeting, Mr Kirana hastily left, avoiding journalists' questions.
Many families are waiting for the results of the long process of identifying the dead.
Police medicine experts were handed over almost 140 corpses filled with parts of human remains.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The relatives wondered why two months ago a liner was allowed to fly, even though on the 28th of October flight from Bali to Jakarta there was a breakdown, which caused, among other things, a sudden plane crashing down immediately after the takeoff.
Lion Air said this malfunction was removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the technicians concerned must be held liable.
The law is very clear, not they said that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must answer by law so that the plane crashes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Mr Tjahjono said that the large number of small debris and the fact that the debris spread over a rather small area indicate that the liner probably crashed into the water at very high speed.
"The plane was single when it fell into the sea.
It didn't explode in the air, and the engine of the aircraft, when it touched the water, operated with large turns, as shown by all the blades of the broken turbine," the officer explained.
The shipwreck of Lion Air is the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when the crash of Garuda near Medan killed 234 people.
After the accident, rescuers were rescued from the wreckage, and a minor suffered
On Monday evening on the road Turtle - Plungė, the cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz" collided at the Tilviks.
Cars collided with cataclysm and reported three victims.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, drove to the opposite side of the road and the cockpit hit the Mercedes-Benz car, which took place in the father, born in 1967, and the daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters, the rescuers.
The girl from Mercedes-Benz was knocked out her teeth in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidential Palace: No artificial facilitations for referendum
After approval by the Seimas of the proposal of the ruling parties to reduce the referendum bar for the first section of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the President vetoes the amendments, says Mindaugas Lingė, her adviser.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular the articles in its first section, should certainly be at least a majority.
It is easy to predict that the President would definitely veto," Dalia Grybauskaite, adviser to internal politics, said to the News Radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defined the fundamentals of the State - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the State - and, therefore, a reduction in the number of votes required to amend these articles would, according to Mr Linge, create a 'negative precedent' and 'open uncontrollable risks'.
"The President believes that there is no need for artificial facilitation, more preparation for the referendum itself, more dialogue with the people," he said.
The Seimas intends to vote on the adoption of the Amendment to the Law on Referendum on Tuesday.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Chapter 1 and Chapter 14 of the Constitution with higher protection shall be taken if at least two fifths of the citizens entitled to vote agree to this during the referendum.
Currently, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote can replace articles in sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution by a referendum.
Some 2.5 million citizens have electoral rights in Lithuania: one half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths would be one million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas confirmed in September the President's veto on earlier parliamentary amendments which relaxed the requirements for the number of votes by changing Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution defining citizenship.
It is proposed that the referendum should be reduced in the run-up to the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May next year and on 26 May when the first and second rounds of presidential elections are planned.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990 are currently unable, with some exceptions, to have double citizenship.
The Lithuanian community seeks double citizenship, but fears that under the current conditions a referendum would not take place - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian Airports "braška", therefore they need to be updated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is starting to scratch, therefore it must be updated, says Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the State must carry out.
"Air transport infrastructure is already strawing because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must upgrade Vilnius Airport - it does not even fall into the long-distance planning, it is the minimum we must do," said Mr Masiulis at the transport conference organised by the Democracy Development Fund and the magazine State on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be particularly important, as important projects will have to be implemented - construction of "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", construction of Klaipėda external port, renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete the integration of roads, railways, construction of an external port in Klaipėda, to clean up airports, perhaps to decide on the construction of a new airport.
We have to stay awake and start projects that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years' time," said the Minister of Transport and Communications.
Mr. Masiulis said that there has been too little funding for road maintenance in recent years.
"The condition of the roads is not improving yet, because the funds are not sufficient.
We are able to build new roads, but even the necessary maintenance, such as those on highways, is lacking.
We must set the amount to be allocated to road maintenance if their condition is to improve," Mr Masiulis said.
He stressed that Lithuanian transport sector services exports grew by 18.6% this year, while the largest export market became Germany, which was ahead of Russia.
Mr Masiulis has once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that carriers from EU countries will be obliged to return their trucks periodically to the country of registration.
"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for tractors to come home permanently is absurd, because empty trucks would be driven in Europe, fuel would burn, and emissions would increase.
Railways will be the most happy thing to do because the costs will rise to such an extent that part of the transport will move to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," Mr. Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, 12.2% is generated in the transport sector.
Lithuanian Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It has more than 118.000 employees and more than 7,500 companies.
Dispute with Heritage Conservationists
Last week, Mr. Masiulis announced to the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on the change of the cultural purpose of the building at Vilnius Airport, which would allow to demolish the old terminal and build a new one.
However, the temporary head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis called the deliberations of Masiulis political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1950 ’ s was a treasure recorded in the register in 1993, and it was not for politicians, but for experts to decide on its removal.
Mr Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of Lithuania's image.
"To withdraw this old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal, so that when you come to Vilnius you feel like a modern country, rather than such an interesting one that really does not represent our country as innovative," Mr Masiulis said at the Seimas last week.
Mr Masiulis then also announced that a completely new passenger terminal is planned to be built in Kaunas and that the airport is to be connected to the Rail Baltica track by building an underground station.
This transport node is expected to be operational in 2026 after the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year, Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, with 4.8 million passengers expected this year and 5 million passengers expected next year.
Kaunas Airport handled a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.

Start direct flights to Madagascar from Vilnius next year
Next spring, the largest passenger plane, Boeing 767, flying on regular flights, will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly from Lithuania directly to the Bay island of Madagascar, based on the information of the tour operator Itaka Lietuva, writes "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that Blue Panorama airlines will be able to choose from 259 economic class and 8 business class locations.
The new holiday destination will be reached directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominic Milowski, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says that he is trying to offer tourists from Lithuania new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators also prepared new holiday destinations for the summer season 2019.
For example, "Novaturas" and "Itakas" will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on a possible crisis: it is important not to talk about illness
"We always have to get ready for tougher times.
What I want to be happy about is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in the history of Lithuania, we have accumulated reserves.
But it is also very important not to talk about the disease," Mr Shapoka said while visiting Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday the Minister of Finance and Vice-Minister of Finance Miglė Tuskienė is attending meetings of the Eurogroup and the ECOFIN Council in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
The aim of this new tax is to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that agreement be reached on how to tax revenue generated from the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States, as long as there is no consensus at global level.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian draft budget as not in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has taken advantage of this opportunity.
Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain were asked to provide further information.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of Economic and Monetary Union: the feasibility of a European Deposit Insurance Scheme and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Burach.
Lithuanian labour traditions and customs
Recently he has been 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and ethnographer Balys Burač (1897-1972) in Sidari, Šiauliai County, then Šiauliai Governorate.
Celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian State, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-saving national revival has called many people of Lithuania, including brothers Burachus - Bali, John, Bronius - from the very depths of the village for all creative powers to engage in fostering, meaning and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Burač, who spent more than 50 years traveling through his native country with a camera in his arms, presented a wide and realistic view of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing strata of national culture and had a rare ability to grasp the lasting value of his work.
In the photographs of Balys Buračas, Lithuanian landscapes, hillforts, everyday and festive atmospheres, our people decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of the legacy of Balys Buračas, which is devoted to describing national labour customs and related traditions and, most importantly, to their attractive iconography.
The material published shows not only the distinctiveness and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite the two world wars and the hard occupation.
The manuscript of the book is rich in the works of interwar Samogitia, especially the Kubiškines, Šiauliai, Telšiškiai, as well as the works of the residents of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their holidays and other traditions and customs of Balys Buračas.
Of the about 10,000 remaining negatives stored in museums and archives, over 400 rare photos, mostly not yet published, have been selected for this publication, which are grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, characteristic of the Doubian people, Dzūkiai, and other areas of Aukštaitija and Samogitija.

Tragic Destiny of a Couple — Lost Just A few Hours of Marriage
In the southwest of the U.S. State of Texas, a couple of newlyweds who had been married just a few hours earlier died in a helicopter crash.
The 24-year-old William Troy Caseer and his co-age wife, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, died on Sunday shortly after midnight when the helicopter fell into a hill 16 km northwest of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
Surprisingly, the disaster occurred at a distance of about 25 miles [24 km], just as the newlyweds were years old.
The helicopter pilot, 76, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, has also died.
The newlyweds studied at the State University of Sam Houston, in the city of Huntsville, Texas.
They got married on Saturday evening at the family ranch near Juvaldi, and after the wedding celebration, they flew out with a family helicopter.
The disaster occurred when the helicopter flew about 25 miles [24 km].
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antonio International Airport, where they intended to board the plane and fly for the honeymoon, said Mr. Kennedy, without giving the couple the final destination.
"It is a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," said Mr Kennedy.
Dr. D. Lawrence has been piloting that family aircraft for many years.
According to Mr Kennedy, he was piloting helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be clear what the physical condition of the pilot was and whether it could not have caused the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after takeoff.
His debris appeared in a wide radius on the rocky hillside, and the hull remained "dangerously hanged", said Air Safety Investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transport Security Board (NTSB) at a press conference on Monday.
The researchers are going to take the debris away and then thoroughly inspect it, but the truck and truck will not be easy to reach that place, he spoke.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been identified and the preliminary NTSB report should be published after two weeks.
Israel's Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions against Iran a "historical day"
"Today is a historic day," said Mr Netanyahu to the MPs of his party "Likud", reported his office.
"Today is the day when under the leadership of President (Donald) Short (Donald Trump) the United States imposes particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions against Iran throughout the period when efforts to curb his aggression began," said the Head of the Israeli Government.
Earlier on Monday, the Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman stated that the new sanctions would be a 'dead' blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures that Washington calls 'the most severe sanctions of all time' were introduced following Mr Short's decision in May and the controversial decision to withdraw from the world's power agreement with Tehran on his nuclear programme.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iranian oil exports, which have already dropped by about a million barrels a day since May, and to cut Tehran off international financing.
Israel has long been opposed to the aforementioned agreement with Iran and is saying that its scope and timeframe are too limited.
The Jewish state also says that the lifting of sanctions has enabled Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has promised to prevent it from establishing itself there from a military point of view.
Other participants in the agreement with Iran - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - are opposed to the US decision and say that the agreement has so far not allowed Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.
The court again explores the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
After the death of a young motorcyclist in the Northern town of Vilnius, the court will hear the testimony of the witness in the case of the completed accident.
The Vilnius Regional Court decided on Tuesday that one of the witnesses of the case would be heard at the next sitting on November 26 in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case.
Acquittal has already been issued in this case, but the prosecutor's office does not agree with it.
On August 22, the District Court of Vilnius City acquitted the driver of the car due to the motorcyclist’s death, declaring 79-year-old Eduard Osipova that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed in the city and committed a serious violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office asks the District Court to annul the judgment of the District Court and states that E.Osipov is the main responsible for the accident, and the conclusions of the District Court are not valid.
The family attorney of the killed motorcyclist also asks for the acquittal to be lifted.
The accident took place on August 11, 2015, at around 3 p.m., when the vehicle Škoda Fabia, driven by E. Osipov, drove from Lakūnai street to Žirmūnai street and encountered the main motorcycle that drove the road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man that the car driver violated the Rules of the Road, which provided for giving the road, and caused the accident - the man killed on the main road motorcycle Piaggo.
Initial police reports indicate that the scooter driver was killed, but later, after investigations, it was found that the vehicle was likened to a motorcycle in terms of power.
Rolandas Bužinskas, judge of Vilnius City District Court, said that the experts found that the motorcycle driver was driving at a speed of 89,2 km/h, although the speed allowed at that place was 50 km/h.
"The car driver couldn't predict that the motorcycle would drive at such high speed," said the judge.
At that time, the driver of an elderly car claimed to drive at a speed of just 5-6 kilometers an hour.
When the motorcycle driver saw the obstacle, he tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before facing the Skoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that E. Osipov, who was driving from side to main road, had to give way to a motorcyclist.
Novaja Gazeta: Six Vagner mercenaries perished in Syria
The victims include five Syrian troops and six persons belonging to the military company Wagner.
The source of Novaja Gazeta is announcing this in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Corps of the Syrian Armed Forces was stationed in that area, to which a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries" joined.
Novaja Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request to provide information about Russian fate.
A former Belgian king will have to undergo a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as a child of a former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II had a long love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old king denies fatherhood.
According to the station RBF, he may refer the matter to the Supreme Court in opposition to the DNA investigation.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel - the ex-husband of Delphine's mother - is neither biologically nor legally the father of the artist.
Delphine asked for a proper investigation to be recognized as Albert's daughter of the "real" father.
The CEC will distribute money to the parties, but it will not give social workers anything
This week the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) intends to distribute a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), established this spring, led by Vice-President of Parliament Gediminas Kirkilas, has not yet been budgeted.
However, they may be awarded in the near future by a separate decision of the CEC in the event of a change in the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to parties.
Laura Matjošaityte, President of the CEC, informed the CGI that "this Thursday a commission meeting is scheduled to take a decision on the allocation of the half-yearly budget grant to the parties".
According to her, the CoR has to take a decision on this matter by 15 November.
It is planned to allocate EUR 2.751 million to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling State and Green Union - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Liberal Movement - almost EUR 0.4 million, the Labour Party without its own political group - about EUR 0.23 million, the party of Procedure and Justice that recently joined the ruling parties - almost EUR 0.22 million, represented in the parliament, but neither the ruling nor oppositional Polish election campaign-the Christian Family Union - about EUR 0.18 million.
Under the law currently in force, which will guide the CEC in allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties which meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP established this spring to expect to receive money from the budget.
This party has not yet taken part in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that the social workers receive at least about two hundred thousand euros in the run-up to the three elections next year - self-government, the President and the European Parliament.
The respective amendments to the laws of political parties and this year's budget, adopted by the Seimas, were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the ruling people, Mr Kirkilas, and the leader of the peasant-greens, Ramūnas Karbauskas, believe that the parliamentarians will seek to reject the President's objections.
However, it will not be possible to do this before this Thursday's CEC meeting, so, according to Mr Matjošaitytė, 'grants will be divided according to the legal order that has existed so far'.
It is true that the Head of the Supreme Court did not reject that if the Seimas rejected the President's veto this week or next week and a new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to the parties would enter into force, the Commission may consider a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"We will take into account the whole legal environment in force when making our decision, because we are an executive body to implement the laws adopted," she said.
Should the Seimas be able to reject the veto and new laws enter into force, additional money would be assigned to parties by the Government, which would have borrowed the corresponding amounts.
Grants already awarded to seven parties would not be penalised by such a decision.

Poroshenko: Victims of murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
"I wish to state that none of the versions - and of them today more than 20 - will be rejected.
Each will be checked very carefully in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I have no opportunity and I do not have to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish evil," said P. Poroshenko at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in the detection of the murder of Mr Handziuk and that the murderers, the perpetrators of the crime and the principals would 'accept the necessary responsibility'.
"After this case has been re-qualified to murder (case), they are absolutely right and justified in the threat of life imprisonment," the President of Ukraine said.
He rightly called on the public to investigate this case openly and impartially.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the statements made by representatives of the law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that 'the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whatever they may be'.
He also said that political speculation on this subject would not help to clarify the situation, but would confuse everything even further.
"I urge all the forces supporting both power and opposition, not to waste unreasonable arguments and, God forbid, not to use this murder for public relations," the President said.
- On the contrary, we now need to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - so as to build public confidence.
There's just no other way for us."
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilise the situation in the country," he assured.
In July, K. Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked and engulfed with acid in Kherson.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern city of Ukraine.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but she died in the hospital on Sunday.
If the police and prosecutors did not find out the perpetrators of this attack, on Tuesday the Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenka presented a resignation statement.
After her death, government officials received accusations from public activists that they were unable to conduct a proper investigation.
The activists also demanded the resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of the Interior.
'I am making my resignation today,' informed Mr Lucenka, who reads his study report.
Parliament has yet to approve the prosecutor's resignation.
Lucenko has accused activists of exerting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of Handziuk's murder.
Bill Gates introduced the toilet without water
By presenting the futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from the traditional facilities to the waterless one with the computer revolution of the 1970 ’ s.
The founder of Microsoft Bill Gates presented the high-tech toilet at the exhibition in Beijing, which does not need water supply pipes, reported Reuters.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of sewage are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technology you see here is the greatest achievement in sanitation in the last 200 years," Bill Gates quoted Bloomberg.
The technological toilet was created with the help of a charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda.
Over the course of seven years, a facility was used to convert human waste into fertiliser or water, for which the fund spent $200 million.
In total, Bill Gates said, about 20 toilet models were created.
Now the installation is complete and can be sold.
However, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend an additional 200 million in order to allow such toilets to be produced en masse.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500 000 children under the age of five die every year worldwide as a result of poor sanitation.
Tackling the problems of poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, is increasing the spending on health care, which already amounts to 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates is in the toilet presentation of a jar with feces.
According to him, this is a good reminder of the fact that in a small example, "may contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100,000 worm parasite eggs".

Anxiety in France: the deaths of people are a cause for concern
On Monday, the French health authorities announced a permanent ban on the widespread use of pesticides due to concerns about several dozen people who have recently been poisoned in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that a decision to ban all products containing metam was taken following a new safety inspection launched earlier this year before at least three waves of poisoning started in September in the department of Man and Loire.
These cases have already led to the suspension of pesticide use by the government.
This soil disinfection chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, the annual consumption was around 700 tonnes.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Angers region, where many lettuces are grown, complained about the sore eyes and throat, breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but did not rush it," said the Deputy Director of ANSES Francoise Weber (Fransuaza Weber) on Monday.
Metam - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe - is considered by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to be a 'likely human carcinogen'.
This pesticide, marketed under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is permitted in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is to be carried out.
"There was no choice but to remove it from the market, whether or not there are alternatives to it," said Mr Weber.
"We understand the difficulties for lettuce producers, farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to stop the use of drop-outs in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
This region is home to more than half of the 35 thousand tonnes of lettuces consumed in Europe each year, near Nantes.
The next season there will be "many less salad lamb, radishes and couples", last month, after the government stopped the use of the metam, AFP told the news agency Philippe Retere, leader of the Nantes Federation of Producers.
70 million EUR invested in the shopping centre with a viewing wheel in Tallinn
In the coming weekend a new shopping centre "T1" opens in the capital of Estonia, in which the local capital real estate development company "Pro Kapital Grupp" invested EUR 70 million.
A total of 130.000 sq. m, or 55.000 sq. m, of rented area, will have 150 shops or entertainment sites, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer's report.
In comparison, the total area of Vilnius Akropolis (calculated together with the area for offices) is about 110.000 sq. m. O rented - 91.000 sq. m.
"T1" is the first shopping centre with a roof-mounted view wheel, says the developer.
It will be operational at the beginning of next year.
In addition, the international transport gateway will also be integrated into the territory, with trams standing alongside and intercity buses running soon.
Nearby, the main "Rail Baltica" terminal also stretches, and it is expected that it will serve 1 million passengers per year in 2026.
Paol Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that the global shopping centre business is undergoing major changes, and that the development of T1 has succeeded in getting ahead of them.
"We have created a new generation shopping centre, giving emotions and experience, not accessible online.
It is a place of attraction for people in the very centre of the city, a visitor's gate, an impressive and worth paying attention to a sightseeing object and at the same time a high-quality time with friends or family," Michelozzi is quoted in the press release.
Focus on entertainment
According to the manager of the shopping centre, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltic States.
A total of 12,000 sq. m, or one fifth of the total rented area, is devoted to entertainment.
Exceptional accent - a view wheel on the roof.
He will raise the guests to 120 m above sea level - only the TV tower is taller in Tallinn.
Under the watch wheel, on the fourth floor, there will be a trampoline park Super Skypark, which will open the largest trampoline centre in Europe and the first basketball and trampoline volleyball square in Estonia, says the company.
The interactive SkyLAB Research and Discovery Centre promises to take children for at least 5-6 hours.
A 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema will be located in the entertainment complex.
In addition to the usual cinema shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to empathize with virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to the visual effects and the movement of chairs based on the rhythm of the film, the feeling of realism here will be enhanced by felt effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as selected smells, smoke or fog in the cinema hall.
According to the developer, the opening of the T1 is expected to increase Estonian tourism revenues by EUR 13 million per year, attracting more than 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Stock Exchange as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year the group received EUR 1.8 million in sales revenue and incurred losses of EUR 350.000, shows the financial report of Pro Kapital Grupp.
In 2016 sales revenue of almost EUR 9 million and net profit of EUR 2.4 million were generated in the Lithuanian market.
The T1 shopping centre was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
President Paul Biya, sworn for the seventh term after the controversial elections in Cameroon
During the 85-year-old ceremony under the supervision of the Speaker of Parliament, Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, Biya promised to protect the 'unity and unity' of the West African state.
The oldest president of Africa, who has been ruling his country for 35 years, was declared a winner in the 7 October elections, which received 71% of the votes.
However, the elections were darkened by low voter turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biya's inauguration, 79 pupils and three school staff, including the director, were kidnapped at a presbyterian school in the North Western region, where the English-speaking separatists are conducting an armed campaign for independence.
Most of Cameroon's 22 million inhabitants are French-speaking and one fifth English-speaking.
In 2016, in the north-west and neighbouring South-west province, a challenge to the alleged discrimination in education, courts and the economy began to call for autonomy.
In 2017, when Biya refused to condone, radicals announced an independent state, "Ambassany Republic", and lifted weapons.
According to non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces were killed in separatist attacks and government response operations this year.
More than 300 000 people have fled from violence: some have fled the border to Nigeria, but many have been forced to live undernourished in forests.
Only 5% of voters voted in the North Western region during the elections in October and 15% of the electorate voted in the South Western province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya received two thirds of the votes.
Conservative First Elections: Errors Caused by Inexperience
"Something was missing - understand that the party organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed access to their premises, but not everywhere there were voting booths, because we cannot afford them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent it," the politician said.
According to him, complaints were received, but their content does not change the substance, and the infringements themselves are not of a malignant nature.
"There have been complaints.
Not all of the people who took part in the elections had experience, and that was news for them too.
Thus, not all of our actions were in keeping with our order.
Therefore, the CRC had to be warned to comply with the principles we described.
These complaints do not, however, give rise to doubts about the results," Anušauskas said.
According to the President of the CoR, there have been cases where ballot papers have not been stamped - when the ballot papers found in ballot boxes have been withdrawn without a seal.
Some towns lacked space, but according to Anušauskas, complaints and violations relate to several dozen ballot papers.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it certainly does not make a fundamental difference to the election results," Anušauskas explained.
It is said that the participation of the members of the party in the elections was 55%, while the participation of non-party voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked on the commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also remain unchanged - 79 per cent of voters (6418 votes) voted for Ingrid Šimonytė, who won, while 21 per cent (4441 votes) voted for Vygauda Usackas.
On 17 November, the Council of the TS-LKD will officially support Šimonytė's candidacy in the presidential election in May next year.
Short says probably not to meet Putin in Paris
The White House's National Security Adviser John Bolton said earlier that Mr. Trump would meet with Mr. Putin in Paris, where this week the 100th anniversary of World War I will be celebrated.
However, in his last rallys before the mid-term elections of the US Congress, Mr Trump stated to journalists that he was not sure whether this would be a good opportunity to meet the Russian President.
"I'm not sure I'll see you in Paris.
Probably not," noted the President of the United States.
However, the President of the White House added, they will see each other at the G-20 summit and 'probably meet many times' afterwards.
Mr Trump is still trying to "restart" relations with Moscow, despite the suspicion that Russia was interfering in the presidential elections in 2016.
Kęstutis Strupas requests annulment of the decision of the VTE
Kęstutis Strupas, former Director General of Santara Clinics of Vilnius University, is asking to revoke the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTE) – it recognised that transactions were not declared in time and thus violated the law.
On Tuesday K. Strup’s complaint was examined by Vilnius Regional Administrative Court.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The claimant requests annulment of the decision of the VTE on 23 May, BNS informed the court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė.
K. Strupas believes that gifts to relatives should not be declared, he claims that he has understood the exception of the law in this way.
In May, VTEK announced that the Director General of Santara Clinics K. Strupas and Silvija Strupienė, Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican University Hospital of Vilnius, had then been removed, violated the provisions of the Law regulating the declaration of private interests.
The investigation established that four transactions were declared in accordance with the time limits: in 2010, a loan was taken from the bank to the spouse, the purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift was given to the daughter in 2017, a flat and in 1996 a loan was granted to the natural person together with the spouse and not repaid.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by missing time limits.
Persons who have violated the Law on the Adjustment of Public and Private Interests in the Civil Service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own data, but also your spouse’s data.
The study was carried out by the VTK on the basis of Info TV TV information.
S. Strupienė, the head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, duly and timely declared the transactions that she had concluded.
According to Info TV, last year K. Strupas gave his daughter a gift of real estate worth 125 thousand euros.
However, the former head of Santara Clinics and his wife had not given the above information in their declarations of interest.
Law enforcement K. Strupas, together with at least ten more people, has expressed suspicions in the corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, for winning public computer and software purchases in clinics, illegal financial compensation was demanded from companies, it was disguised as support.
In this way, K. Strupas is suspected to have spoken at least five times during public procurement in the field of information technology in Santara clinics.
K. Strup himself denies his guilt.
In September, Professor K. Strupas, who is suspected of corruption, was dismissed from the position of head of Santara Clinics.
According to the decision of the Ministry of Health of Santara Clinics and Vilnius University, labour relations with K. Strupai were terminated at his own request.
He was in charge of the hospital from 10 November 2013.
The Santara clinics continue to be led by Professor Juozas Raistenskis on a temporary basis until the competition to elect a new CEO is held, and it is promised to be announced this year.

You already want to teach differently in schools: promises fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday in Vilnius at the Forum "Changes in Educational Content: Foreign Experience for Solutions in Lithuania".
Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė, who spoke during the discussion, said that over 30 million euros were invested in updating the content of education in the last ten years, but no results were seen.
"According to the results of the international research of pupils' achievements PISA, students' achievements are below the OECD average," Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said.
The OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted in a report by the Ministry of Education and Science, said that Lithuania was too focused on providing knowledge rather than on practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in Lithuania general education programmes pay a lot of attention to students' literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also needed to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
Vice Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius presented changes in the content of general education, stating that the scope of programmes to be updated this school year will decrease, they will be more specific and disciplined more closely interrelated.
According to the Vice Minister, the education of pupils will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30 per cent of their unique educational content, the current system of pupil assessment will change to a cumulative score, and will gain a greater weight of the competences of the student acquired informally.
The number of standardised tests will decrease.
Promised that general curricula will be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, task bank.
The aim of updating the content of education is to improve pupils' achievements in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to reduce by one third the gap between pupils' achievements, pupils' acquired modern competences at school, and to be literate in various areas.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million from the European Union and the state budget to update the content of education in May 2018.
It is expected that the project of the general education programmes updated during the 2019-2020 school year will be tested in a part of schools, and from September 2021 they will be implemented in all schools.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism of the nearly EUR 8 million project being implemented by the Development Centre for Primary, Basic and Secondary Education to update the general curricula.
For four years, EUR 7.8 million were earmarked for this, and the first purchase of EUR 1.3 million was announced at the beginning of October, looking for developers.
After the experts criticised this purchase, he was suspended, and Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė dismissed the director of Education Development Center Giedrius Vaidelius from his position.
Lithuania - Exercises to respond to extreme flooding
A ten-day exercise to improve the response of institutions to extreme flooding begins on Monday in Lithuania.
During the exercise, as reported by the Fire and Rescue Department, state institutions will be screened for their readiness to work in the country following a state-level emergency, such as the flood: to respond to its consequences, to coordinate the search for, rescue and immediate eviction of people from flooded areas, to organise their provision of drinking water, food, to ensure the necessary energy supply and to provide other measures for the protection of the population.
The exercise will be attended by more than 100 representatives from all ministries of the country, other institutions, as well as 12 municipalities emergency operations centres.
On 5-13 November the preparatory phase of the exercise will take place, during which the municipalities, which received information from the Hydrometeorology Service from the PRT about the continuous precipitation and the beginning of the flood, will decide on emergency management.
The active phase of the exercise is planned for November 14-15.
During this period, the State Emergency Operations Centre will operate in the department, and in state and municipal institutions - the institutions emergency operations centres.
Upon the declaration by the Government of a state-level emergency due to the consequences of the flood, the head of operations appointed by the Prime Minister will lead the response to the emergency, the elimination of its consequences, and actions of protection and rescue of residents and property.
PRT Deputy Director Mindaugas Kanapickas says that in the exercise, it is most important to check the institutions' readiness to perform the functions provided for in the legal acts, to assess the possibilities for exchanging information, to check how people, state and municipal institutions, agencies and enterprises are prepared to warn and inform about an imminent disaster, and to "improve the state institutions' emergency management skills".
The exercise will also demonstrate the joint capabilities of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian fire-fighters to pump huge amounts of water from flooded areas.
The BaltFloodCombat module was established for this purpose in 2009.
Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuri Lucenka resigns
Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuri Lucenka, speaking on Tuesday, announced his resignation in the national parliament for the resonance caused by the death of an acid-washed fighter Katrina Gandziuk, published by the Ukrainian news agency Union.net.
According to Ukrainian law, the Prosecutor General must submit his request for resignation to the President of the country, who must submit to the Supreme Rada for approval by a majority.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General Lucenko presented the progress and results of the law enforcement investigation on ordering murder of K. Gandziuk in the Verkhovna Rada.
In his speech to the parliamentarians, he described the study as effective, but expressed his indignation that the death of Mr Gandziuk was exploited by politicians for public relations.
Gandziuk was an activist in Ukraine, a fighter against corruption, and spoke publicly about police corruption in her home town of Kherson, southern Ukraine.
On 31 July, an unknown attacker, K. Gandziuk, sniffed acid in his face at her house.
On 4 November, she died in the hospital because of her injuries.
The protestors at the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine demand an answer as to who killed Mr Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix photo.
According to Mr Lucenko, in the law enforcement investigation 12 persons are possibly involved in ordering the murder of K. Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the investigation has been clouded to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the Prosecutor General, due to the leak of information, suspects received essential knowledge for them.
Mr Lucenko added that he had personally known Mr Gandziuk and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"So that no one has any reason to say that someone is clinging to the power, I would like to state that I am making a declaration to resign.
I will present it today to the President of Ukraine, and you will have to discuss it in Parliament," Mr Lucenko quotes the publication 'Obozrevatel' in Rada.
It is said that Mr Lucenko added that 'it cannot allow the country to control itself when the law enforcement system is destroyed without any evidence, even for the crimes discovered'.
Mr Lucenko is considered to be a close associate of President Poroshenko.
He was appointed Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 after long-standing attempts to remove his predecessor from the post, Viktor Shokin, suspected of covering up corruption by top-level officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets with Orlen Lietuva representatives
As Elta was informed by Aurelija Vernickaitė, adviser to the Minister for Energy, the meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector currently falling short of the aggregated national renewable energy action plans at EU level, with a share of 6% in renewable energy in 2015.
According to the EC, progress towards a binding 10% target in the transport sector is relatively slow due to various difficulties, including relatively high greenhouse gas emission reduction costs and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector comes mainly from biofuels (88%) and electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas took the proposal to supplement the issues of the investigation of corruption with the appeals of the Conservatives to the KT
On Tuesday, after the presentation, the Seimas approved such a proposal, which was registered by the "valstienė" Agnė Širinskienė, who was in charge of the investigation of the illegal influence on political processes.
There were 58 Members of the Seimas, 27 against, and nine MPs abstained.
The draft will be discussed further by the Seimas committees, the Committee on Legal Affairs led by A. Širinskiene as the main committee.
Upon receipt of his opinion, a vote on the adoption of an amendment to the resolution will be taken.
Currently, the temporary investigation commission of the Seimas conducting a new investigation of political corruption has been instructed to investigate the possible unlawful influence in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed to extend this deadline by stating that "relevant information about possible illegal influence and influence on political processes and state institutions appeared in the public sphere".
Širinskienė refers in the draft to "a possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or when applying to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such important independent institutions as the Chief Official Ethics Commission".
The appeal to the Constitutional Court for pensions was initiated by opposition conservatives.
The ruling 'States' have found that the conservatives relied largely on the arguments of private pension lawyers in their appeal.
The leaders of the "valstyčiai" of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTE) blame former co-founder Povilas Urbšis.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Seimas Committee on State Administration and Municipalities was able to instruct the members of the VTE to dismiss the former head of the Commission’s Prevention Division Mindaugas Šuraris.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to investigate the influence of interested persons or their groups, possibly unlawful, influence on the course of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual political groups, the activities of parties and public movements and funding, legislative processes, the election of members of state-owned enterprises, heads of public institutions, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to look at the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to competent authorities and how they have responded to it.
Investigators should submit their findings by 1 May of the following year.
At that time, there will be an election campaign for the President, the European Parliament.
Of the 12 members of the commission, seven are representatives of the "States".
Two social workers, one "officer", a liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian Polish election campaign-Christian Family Union were also appointed as members.
Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the commission's work.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskas, the Chairman of the Union of Managing Peasants and Greens of Lithuania.
According to him, the investigation carried out by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSPC) during the previous session showed, in principle, that the investigation had to be continued for the same reasons.
Head of German internal intelligence lost his post
Maassen, a 55-year-old controversy, has been fueled by the statement that his problems are due to the 'radical left' forces in the Merkel coalition.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but was forced to leave for reserve.
Among other things, last weekend it became clear that, at the meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Mr Maassen criticised the 'naive' immigration policy of Mrs Merkel.
The German Minister for the Interior, Horst Seehofer, who has been defending the head of intelligence for a long time, stated at a press conference on Monday that Mr Maassen's recent comments are unacceptable and 'disappointed personally'.
Mr Seehofer, himself under pressure from both this dispute and the poor appearance of his party in the Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to send Mr Maasseen to the reserve.
The whole island has been terrified by a series of shark attacks - the third man has been bitten.
A Queensland Emergency Service report says that the victim suffered "serious wounds in his feet and wrists" in the attack on the island of Sid Harbor, on the shores of Queensland.
The man was taken to the hospital by helicopter.
The island of Pentecost is the largest of the archipelago objects of the same name, attracting many lovers of diving and sailing from all over the world.
Shark attacks in this region have so far been relatively rare.
On September 19, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbor, and on the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last attack on the latest range of attacks took place in this archipelago in 2010.

Violent Girls Destroy Stereotypes of Wedding Dress
A sturdy girl with a white puffed bride dress - mission (no) possible?
Can the white swan that sails toward the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
The participants of the Plus Size Reality Show "The Evolution of Size (r)" will already prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on a woman's kilos.
But that's not all - one of the project's girls will be in tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will come to the shooting floor.
"There are still those who think that the bigger girls don't get the attention or the eyes of the boys.
It's just a myth -- my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me as I am, he doesn't require a standard figure from me," Aurika, a participant in the show, will talk to the wedding dress before the show.
Wedding dress is not easy, in all senses, clothing - it is a complex construction, it contains a lot of material, dress a heavy, uncomfortable movement.
Also, some women think that the bigger girl in the white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident.
I can reassure you that a properly chosen dress model really solves this "problem", - explained one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robertas Kalinkinas.
The fates of the girls in the project are decided by R. Kalinkin, together with the entire commission - plus the size of the fashion house opening Erika Vitulskienė, photographer and social networking star Nagli Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukštė.
"Deciding which girl has to say good-bye to the show, there are many quarrels between the members of the commission - we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show in different ways.
The task of showing wedding dresses was even more complicated, and now I can reveal that two newcomers have appeared, which were certainly not worse than the old ones.
It was a special evening in all senses," says R. Kalinkinas.
Newcomers - 23 years of scandalous behaviour in one summer reality show famous Eve and 31 years of exceptional beauty, mother of two children Dovilė - like other girls took part in the selection of "Skyd's (r) evolution" and got into the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo shoot of girls on the streets of Vilnius city they had to say goodbye to the project.
LNK spectators returned to the show after voting for their favorites on the television portal.
The international recognition of the Reality Show of the Bunch Beauty in Lithuania is already taking place in the second week - here plus size girls compete for the name of the first country plus size star.
So far, only eight of them have been left - and they are all fully aware that the winner can only be one.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "The Evolution of Size (r)" starts this Monday evening at 20:30 on the LNK.
Actor I. Elba has been elected the world's sexiest man
The U.S. magazine People has announced this year's sexiest man in the world.
It was a 46-year-old British actor, Idris Elba.
Although he says that this message was unexpected, he did not lack fun when he spoke of the new title.
I thought, "You can't be!
Seriously?"
And then I looked at myself in the mirror and I thought -- yes, today I look sexy -- laughed to share the actor.
Frankly, Idris described this title as a very pleasant feeling that glazed his ego.
The British star claims that he often received insulting words and bullying, who made his childhood difficult, because, as he calls it, he was "very tall and clumsy".
The young actor did not please his peers and became a object of bullying, also because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"As soon as I grew up a mustache and I became the coolest guy in my town district," Idris smiled.
When a man loses his pride on the Ose screens, Mr Elba works as a discoman at parties in Spain and especially in the bustling Ibiza.
In his spare time, he enjoys Thai boxing and has a vein for fashion, which he realizes by creating his own line of clothing.
The British actor assures him that his family is the most important thing in the world, so he's planning a wedding with the fiancé Sabrina Showre.
Elba became the 33rd sexiest man in the world elected by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was awarded to Blake Shelton.
A man beaten to death during a drink in the Širvintai district
On Monday evening a man was beaten to death during a drink in Šalkiškiai village in Širvintai district.
According to the data of the Vilnius County Police, at 21.16 a.m. a report was received that a man broke a neighbor during a drink.
In 1943, the medical profession reported the death of a man born in 1943.
Arrested, born in 1994, by a suspect with 2.53 prom drunkenness.
The police are investigating the circumstances of the incident.
Management no longer requires a distance of 20 km for the construction of waste incineration plants
Construction of Vilnius CHP plant, near Gariūnai market.
Incinerators are no longer seeking to maintain a distance of 20 miles [20 km] from settlements when building incinerators.
On Monday, Kęstutis Mažeika, the head of the Committee on Environmental Protection, registered an amendment to the Law on Waste Management, which waives such a requirement.
According to Mr Mažeika, the 'States' group, which previously supported the 20 km approach, promises to support the amendment regarding its refusal.
Mr. Mažeika's amendment provides that as of January 2019 waste incineration plants could be built in accordance with statutory environmental and public health protection requirements.
He admits that the amendments were prompted by the President's doubts about such a ban.
"Having regard to the definition of the territory of residence, it is obvious that a place where the above mentioned objects could be built would be almost impossible to find," the Chairman of the Committee says.
In October, the majority of the government opposed the President's veto amendments to tighten up the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants closer than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided for a permit for the Government to take decisions on the future of the two plants already under construction, taking into account public health interests.
The latter is not proposed by Mr Mažeika.
The waste- and biofuel-fired power plant in Vilnius is built by the energy group Lietuvos energija and in Kaunas – together with the Finnish energy concern Fortum company Fortum Heat Lietuva.
The latter already burns waste in Klaipėda.
Talking about a possible compromise in Brexit negotiations
On Monday, the British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on the difficult Northern Ireland issue, which is thwarting the Brexit negotiations, reported Dublin.
Speaking by phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered the opportunity to review the mechanism of the so-called "Insurance Agreement", which would allow the UK province of Northern Ireland to leave the open border with the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the European Union.
The Irish Prime Minister, Leo Varadkar, promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from this agreement, as stated in a report issued by the Irish Government.
During the conversation, Mr May 'has made it possible to review the insurance mechanism', it is stated therein.
'The Varadkar has made it clear that it is open to the review of new proposals, provided that the result of such a review is not linked to a unilateral decision to terminate the insurance measures,' says the Government's report.
Brexit negotiators cannot find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain withdraws from the Single Market and Customs Union in March next year.
Both parties agree on 'prohibitive measures' to keep the border open between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland pending the conclusion of a larger trade agreement to ensure that additional customs controls at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied temporarily to the whole of the United Kingdom.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Rabab is seeking that Britain should be able to withdraw from the insurance agreement unilaterally in three months.
However, Mr Varadkar told journalists in Dublin that his government 'cannot support' this.
"Insurance for three months or for a limited period of time is not worth the paper on which it will be written," he stated.
In the past, London and Brussels have not confirmed information about the Brexit outbreak in the negotiations after the announcement in Britain at the weekend that the agreement is hand-in-hand.
"I would say that we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done," said Mr May's representative in London.
The European Commission representative, Margaret Schin, also said to journalists: 'We are not there yet'.
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
On Monday, a group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, published a declaration calling for the right to reliable information in the online era.
Among the 25 signatories of the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize, as well as writer Mario Vargas Llosa.
'We call on the good will leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates, through which citizens can make decisions on the basis of facts,' says the Group's report.
They argue that the 'global information and communication space' is a common good that 'must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and of opinion'.
"People have a fundamental right of access to information which is freely collected, processed and disseminated, based on the truth of the commitment, principles of pluralism of approach and rational methods of establishing facts," added the authors of the declaration.
The document calls for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticises 'false news' but who is regularly accused of distorting facts.
The world's leaders should take a stand on this issue when they gather for the Peace Forum to be held in Paris on 11-13 November, as called for by the signatories.
This declaration was made within two months, under the leadership of Mr Ebadi and Mr Christophe Deloire (Christopher Deluare), the head of the Paris-based media freedom and journalistic rights organisation, Reporters without Frontiers (RSF).
Signatories include former President of Senegal Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
The Seimas approved higher penalties for harmful products
The Seimas approved the amendments to the Law on Product Safety providing that penalties for product safety violations should be increased.
The amendments were approved unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Committee on Health Affairs of the Seimas, said, as regards the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives set relate to better consumer protection of products.
In addition, its provisions shall be adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"In my opinion, the proposed draft law is better and more concretely distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, as entities continue to commit repeated infringements after they have paid the fines," said Mr Vinkus.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, and after the approval of the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim at increasing penalties for infringements, strengthening the protection of consumer rights, empowering market surveillance authorities and creating a clear framework for the supervision of product safety requirements and compliance with them.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for producers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the Ministry, the market surveillance authorities did not have access to the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises and inspections during the state product safety control, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry, the time limit of six months for imposing fines and warnings is too short to establish the infringement, to carry out the investigation and to impose a fine.
Also, according to the Ministry, the penalties imposed are not sufficiently effective.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to introduce an obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product in order to ensure its traceability in order to facilitate the identification of suppliers of non-compliant products by market surveillance authorities.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right, when carrying out state product safety control, to enter the territory, buildings, premises and carry out inspections of economic entities which produce, supply the products to the market.
The intention is to increase the amounts of fines for violations of the law.
A fine from EUR 150 to EUR 2 500 (now from 144 to 1 448) would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and on the distributor who has made them available on the market, on the service provider who has provided dangerous services.
A fine from EUR 1 000 to EUR 5 000 (now from EUR 868 to EUR 4 344) would be imposed if the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (CPVO) or another market surveillance authority decided to prohibit the placing on the market and making available of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to withdraw dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them would lead to a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6500 (now between 1 448 and 5 792).
If dangerous products have harmed the health of the consumer, a fine of between €2 500 and €15,000 (now €1,448 to 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between €6 500 and €25,000 (now €5 792 to €23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria a fine of up to EUR 25 000 is imposed for infringements of product safety legislation (no minimum fine has been fixed), in Belgium a fine of EUR 26 to EUR 600 000, in Romania a fine of EUR 155 to EUR 6 666, in Bulgaria a fine of EUR 125 to EUR 7 500.
A 10-year-old had a baby who was raped by a family member
The incident in Colombia has shocked millions of people.
A 10 - year - old girl who was raped by an older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby saw the world thanks to the caesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
For a time, they were under medical supervision.
It still has to take a while before the young mother and the child are released home.
"On the basis of the information I received from police officers, a young child became pregnant after she was sexually used by a family member - a brother," told a foreign television director of the hospital where the birth was received.
The police are investigating an incident of rape and violence against a child.
The Norwegian Armed Battalion participated in NATO exercises in remote and harsh areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of challenging exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital Oslo.
This is part of NATO's exercise "Trishake 2018" - the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the troops from the second Norwegian Armed Forces Battalion spent a lot of time away from home after the September 11 terrorist attacks, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But most of all, they are skilled at war in the Arctic, and these skills are very helpful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, soldiers in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and harsh areas, have been involved in staged battles against genuine British soldiers.
Soldiers have the skills to survive this cold in the wild, but in the harsh climate they have to drag a much bigger weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers in the headquarters say that they share their skills on how to survive and wage war under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which as no other are particularly reminiscent of real warfare, will teach them to be ready in the event of a serious threat.
Premier League winners won the first victory of the season
Monday evening, the 11th round of the English Premier League ended.
The Huddersfield Town team won a particularly important victory after 12 consecutive duels in all tournaments, for which it was the first successful evening of this season.
Huddersfield Town and London's Fulham duel ended in a master victory with a minimum score of 1:0 (1:0).
The duel, which was distinguished as a defense football, caught the eye of the audience, because both teams fought for the most important 3 points, and the winner of the match was not clear until the very last minute.
Nevertheless, the masters kept the weight and prevented the Fulham team from tearing the drawers.
The only and victorious goal of the match at 29 minutes was hit by T. Fosu-Mensah.
It is worth noting that this was the first goal of this season in Huddersfield Town at home.
After the 11th round Huddersfield Town runs in the 18th place of the League, Fulham remains the last, 20.
The vice-president of Kaunas, who has left, does not plan to return to politics
The former vice-president of Kaunas Povilas Mačiulis, who left his work in the municipality and the organization of "United Kaunas" due to support for Vygaudas Usackas in the presidential elections, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
"I want to focus on business.
I am a shareholder in several companies, and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with my family," Mr. Mačiulis said.
He also said that he was not planning to take part in the forthcoming municipal elections.
Mr. Mačiulis had not yet had the opportunity to speak to Mr. Usack after the first election of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrid Shimonyt this Sunday.
"If we are honest, we have not yet been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and talk about the plans for the future.
It is clear that after Vygaudas left the next election struggle this stage of my life is over," said Mr Mačiulis.
He said that he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas policy for support to V.Ušack, but regretted that "Lithuania lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in international relations".
P. Mačiulis worked as deputy mayor of Kaunas in 2011 and later returned to this position after the successful election of "United Kaunas" in 2015.
He is a shareholder of the private school "Erudito lyceis" and several other companies.
The workers work in Kaunas Castle: what are they doing here?
The Kaunas residents, having noticed the workers working in Kaunas castle, hoped that the reconstruction of the remaining tower was finally under way.
For portal kauno.diena.lt The director of Kaunas City Museum Gabrielius Sužedelis assured that the building was being replaced with protective roofings on the south-west tower with a fragment of the defensive wall.
According to the speaker, the roofs will be cans.
"The worn-out tin cover of emergency condition threatened the surrounding people - people could fall in and hurt themselves - so it was necessary to replace it.
The rooftops were no longer resistant to moisture, so it was also detrimental to heritage," the museum director explained.
Will these roofs be like those that were centuries ago?
"All works are combined with heritage and other institutions," G. Sužalėlis added, seeking to make the result as authentic as possible, but also the practical side - the rooftops have to protect the values from moisture.
When working with heritage, a versatile solution has been chosen.
Previously, the elements of Kaunas castle were covered with tin during the Soviet era, so they no longer had any historical value", - detailed the director of Kaunas City Museum.
The works contract was signed on 2 October.
It is planned that the works will not last longer than three months after the signing of the contract.
"It is expected that it will be completed by the end of November," the director of the museum taught his expectations.
According to him, the value of the works carried out amounts to almost 24 thousand euros.
According to the speaker, this amount was earmarked for this year's budget.
Works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company Statija.
According to the research carried out, Kaunas Castle may have appeared earlier.
U.S. and South Korea resumed naval exercise
Now, for two weeks in the southern city of Pohang, there will be a naval exercise with about 500 soldiers, reported by the Ministry of Defence in Seoul.
There are 28 500 soldiers deployed in South Korea.
Both countries have been working on joint military manoeuvres for many years, which Pyongyang calls 'provocation' and 'preparation for invasion'.
On Friday North Korea threatened to renew its nuclear programme if Washington did not cancel economic sanctions against Pyongyang.
Such a change in course could be 'seriously debated', stated the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the TV interview that criminal measures would remain until Pyongyang gave up his nuclear weapon.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet North Korea's envoy Kim Yong Cholu this week in New York.

Eastern Europe Studies Centre will cooperate with two significant brain centres in the USA
According to Linas Kojala, the head of the EESC, who is established in Vilnius and has already counted thirteen years of activity, the networking in the USA will allow the implementation of projects and make Lithuania's voice heard more on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am glad that two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will emerge because the topics of NATO, security, disinformation and development of Eastern Partnership countries are also priorities for them," Kojala said.
The agreements note that EESC and US authorities will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expertise and expertise, and organise expert visits.
This should be especially useful for Lithuanian analysts, since both partners have a great international reputation.
FPR has been operating since 1955 and unites almost a hundred top-level analysts.
FPR was ranked seventh in the latest worldwide ranking of analytical centres drawn up by the University of Pennsylvania.
At that time CEPA, whose analysts were repeatedly invited to consult and work with the highest US political institutions, is in the same ranking as tens.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to break into the U.S. information space and encourage us to raise the quality bar up," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to provide partners with the help of distributing the upcoming EESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among US decision-makers and public space.
The Eastern Europe Studies Centre operates on the basis of ongoing projects and is not maintained by targeted grants.
EESC partners with joint initiatives include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseille
On Monday, two people were easily injured when two buildings collapsed in Marseille, a town in southern France, and the fire service reported.
As the buildings collapsed on the street, the clouds of dust rose.
There were dozens of firefighters working on the site near the famous Marseille Old Port, some with trained dogs.
The local prefecture on Twitter published photos showing a pile of debris and wooden beams, a huge gap in the place where the buildings stood, firefighters working on the scene of the event and cars covered with a thick layer of dust.
The officials said that they were looking for people who might have been under the rubble.
The Marseille firefighters in the twitter reported that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
The amateur video on BFM-TV shows the dust clouds on the street and the mouths of the sleeves are covered with passersby.

A member of the Afghan Special Forces shot an American instructor during the training
Brent Taylor, 39-year-old Mayor of North Ogden north of Salt Lake City, was on a year-long vacation to carry out a mission in Afghanistan.
He was an officer of the Joint Force Staff Military Intelligence, but he had to return to the mayor in January.
Another member of the US army, whose name has not yet been published, was injured in a Saturday attack that claimed the life of Taylor.
According to the officers, B. Taylor died from the fire of infantry weapons.
Commander of the National Guard of Utah Major General Jefferson S. Burton told journalists that B. Taylor helped train and strengthen the capabilities of the Afghan National Army.
The Utah media quoted NATO's announcement that Mr Taylor was shot by one of the trained Special Forces soldiers and that the attacker was killed by Afghan forces.
B. Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains should be taken to Dover Air Base in Delaware on Monday afternoon.
He had previously carried out two missions in Iraq, and this mission in Afghanistan was also his second mission.
In January, before leaving for Afghanistan, Taylor told the local media that he had been assigned to a team of advisors and instructors of the Special Forces Battalion of that country.
At that time, hundreds of Nort Ogden residents gathered on the streets of the city with about 17 thousand inhabitants to escort their mayor, accompanied by a card with his family.
B. Taylor became mayor of the city in 2013.
