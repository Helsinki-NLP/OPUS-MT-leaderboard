Thousands of crowds panic at the Central Park when the Barrier Falls
Thousands of people who panicked about possible shots at an event of a political nature have fled the Central Park when the police barrier collapsed.
The known personalities – the governor of the Democratic Party of New York Andrew Cuomo, Republican Senator Jeff Flake, Janeta Jackson, John Legends – urged the audience to engage in the country's turbulent politics.
When the barrier fell at a Saturday evening event, the authorities quickly assured the audience that they were safe.
Social justice was the main theme of the event, which began in the sunny afternoon.
Some 60 000 observers were gathered at the Universal Citizens' Festival in the Great meadow, where Cardi B, The Weeknd and other pop stars would appear.
Some speakers asked the audience to call the members of the Congress who represented them and to express their views on the Senate meetings this week regarding the candidate for the Supreme Court Bretto Kavanagh.

Alastair Seeley maintained the position of the winner in the British Supersports race
Alastair Seeley won his third victory on the five British Supersport races, which won the 12-wheel sprint on Saturday in Assen, the Netherlands.
The racer from Karikfergus, 0,05 seconds, overtaken the Yamaha driver Jack Kennedy.

Seeley represents Northern Ireland's EHA Racing team, with which he already won the international North West 200 race in May.
The former British champion fought all the race with Kennedy and, despite all the efforts of the dubbler, he failed to beat the rival from Northern Ireland.
Seeley's teammate David Allingham left the seventh in the Supersport race on Saturday.
Scott Swann graduated from the eighth British Talent Cup.

Why do Hong Kong domestic workers learn dance movements?
Some 300 000 foreigners work as domestic workers in Hong Kong.
They are legally required to live in the homes of employers.
These employees work six days a week, up to 18 hours a day for a small fee.

The mayor of Bedford honours Lina Ognissanti, the seller of the cones
Photo: Lina Ognissanti sells ice cream during the warm season and in winter – cones.
For more than 40 years, a woman who has been selling donuts and ice cream in the city centre will be honoured by the private reception of the mayor.
Lina Ognissanti, who sells ice cream and cones on Dinky Donuts Bedford Middleland Road, together with her family, was invited by the pope's tea.
Almost 3 000 people signed a petition online to be awarded or recognised.
Mr Ognissanti said that it was an honour for her to receive such praise.
According to Dave Hodgson, Mayor of Bedford, Mr. Ognissanti and his grandchildren were invited to his office to see the city’s regile and historical artifacts and to drink the pope’s tea.
“Lina Bedforfe has a special place, and her kiosk is part of the city centre,” he said.
I'm glad she accepted my invitation and I look forward to our meeting in my office so that I can thank Lina for her work in our city."
Mr. Ognissanti thanked, in her words, the "pleasant" Bedford residents who thought about her and said: "This is a great honor and a beautiful act."
Sarkab Mahmood, who was petitioning, said that he did not expect so many signatures.
After hearing of the reception, which is planned to be held by the end of the year, he said: "I am very happy about Linna, because she deserves it because of her great character."
On the road with Alster's Lambretta Club
The scooters "Lambretta" were indispensable cultural satellites of the 70's modus.
A group of Italian scooter fans are trying to preserve the spirit of those days.
70 years after the first Alster Lambretta Club was founded, this weekend about 100 amateur scooters from the UK and Ireland gathered in Fermana County.
One of the two members of the first club, Chris Wilson, acquired the first Lambretta in 1966 for about £40.
“For me, the scooter was just a vehicle, but I learned that I could use it in a different way.
It was a bit of a sport.
I did not get involved in the culture of mods, and now I am probably too old for this," he said.
"It was relatively cheap and quite reliable, you could have bought it at an affordable price and bought something more than just going from point A to point B."
He participated in the Lambretta separate start race on the Isle of Man's TT ring.
The first Alster "Lambretta" club was founded in the early 1970s and restructured 12 years ago.
"About 1971 scooters and other forms of transport were becoming less interested in people, and clubs in general suffered as a result of the unrest, so I thought: "Everything, it's the end," said Chris.
"Then, at some point, there was renewed interest and it seems to have grown more and more."
Philip Steele is the secretary of Alster's Lambretta club, which currently has 97 members, responsible for membership.
“The motives of everyone are different.
Some members have been influenced by the culture of modus operandi, which has almost all begun.
Others are race enthusiasts or rockers – you will find all kinds of people here.
There are also those who just have fun in the vintage.
Many scooters have been modified, so two are not the same.
You can keep your scooter steady and ride at 35 or 40 miles an hour, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some Members have improved this.
Some heavily modified scooters could probably reach speeds of up to 100 miles per hour."
During the weekend, there were failures, and some scooters had to be started by pushing.
And while Northern Ireland's weather is not always as pleasant as that of Lambretta's homeland in Italy, this time the scooters in Fermana County were sung.
Ruth Davidson asks the Toors to remain silent on the issue of "Brexit"
Ruth Davidson asked her Conservative colleagues for a "silence period" so that the Prime Minister could agree on "Brexit".
The Scottish Torch said that within two years of the EU referendum, enough time had been allowed for debates.
She expressed her opinion after Boris Johnson's words on the Prime Minister's plan, which he called "sanctionful and absolutely absurd".
She said to the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland that it was time to support the Prime Minister.
At the party conference in Birmingham, which brought together Torry activists, she said: “We have had time for debates over the past two years.
The former Foreign Secretary served in one of the best offices in the history of the country, and during that period most of the current plan, which had already been recognised in November last year, was prepared.
Conservatives must now support the Prime Minister, allow her to complete the deal and help implement the plans in the country.
I think that the period of silence would be very useful."
Her comments followed the sharp criticism of the Brexito debate, which was repeatedly expressed by former foreign secretary Boris Johnson.
In an interview with the BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later assured her that she believed in Brexit and that the plan of her cabinet could ensure a favourable free trade deal with the European Union.
Mr Davidson also said that his participation in the next elections would promise to prevent the second Scottish referendum on independence, as in 2014 "the searchers were promised that such an event would be the only one in their generation".
When asked about a possible repeat referendum on Brexito, she replied: "If we are talking about the history of Scotland, I have repeatedly stated that a referendum cannot be repeated if you are a nationalist and the result is unsatisfactory to you.
I would be hypocritical if I were to say that one more referendum could be held on "Brexit", because I had hoped for a different outcome."
Path M8 after the police incident was reopened
The M8 motorway was reopened after the police incident at Glasgow.
According to the police, the road was closed a little earlier than 07.00 in both directions at the intersection of 15 Townhead in the event of anxiety over the pedestrian.
The traffic on the closed road did not take place for three hours and was disturbed in the city where the marathon Great Scotland Run is taking place.
For 20 years the man was later taken to Glasgow Royal Hospital for research.
A friend of Christine Blasey Ford has confirmed the statement on sexual abuse alleged by Brettus Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was in high school with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the High Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh of sexual abuse when they were both teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Court Committee and explained that, although she did not remember herself at the party house during which the attack might have occurred, she believed in Ford's story.
Previously Keyser made a statement through his lawyer that he did not remember the party and did not even know if he had met Kavanaugh.
On Thursday in front of the Court Committee, Kavanaugh often referred to Keyser's statement as proof of his innocence, but did not mention Keyser's statement that she believed in Ford's words.
President Short Friday ordered the FBI to carry out an investigation within a week when Republican Senator Jeff Flake and other moderate senators asked for time to investigate and for a week to postpone the entire Senate vote on Kavanaugh.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to the committee through his lawyer stating that he wanted to "as much as he could to contribute to an additional investigation by the FBI" on Kavanaugh.
"However, as my client has already explained, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and does not remember a party or gathering in which he would have been with or without Dr Ford," says Keyser's lawyer Howard Walsh.
The letter further explains that Keyser "does not reject Dr. Ford's story and has already said to the press that he believes in Dr. Ford's testimony."
"However, the simplest and irreplaceable truth is that it cannot confirm it because it does not remember the above-mentioned incident," continues the letter.
A friend of Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, who was supposed to be next to the attack, said that he would also contribute to the FBI investigation.
Unlawfully convicted Chicago residents tell us about life with a corrupt policeman and his gang
The chief prosecutor of Illinois is trying to change the history of the Chicago police after a dark period.
It is believed that an unfair policeman has abused innocent residents of social housing and has unjustly arrested a large number of people.
To date, 42 people who have been convicted illegally have been acquitted.
The social housing project of Ida B. Wells currently leaves only an empty parking space on the site, and in the past, its residents were used almost without fear by corrupt Chicago policemen for more than a decade.
They were led by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
Residents accused him and his tactical squad of extortion, forgery and rape of police reports and evidence.
Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of the convicts who have been acquitted so far by the General Prosecutor of Cook County Kim Foxx.
“If you didn’t work with him, you’d end badly.
You were his enemy.
You prevented him from acting and earning," Cleon Glover said about Watts.
“I was very afraid.
I wanted to get out of that neighborhood,
but I had nowhere to go," said Willie Martin.
Lawyers from the Foxx Ethics Division are reviewing a further 30-40 cases related to Watts.
Landon Allen, a resident of Ida-B. Wells' social housing, said that many people decided not to talk about Watts.
"Many people did not keep quiet," he said.
"But it wasn't important."
According to another former resident, Clarissa Baker, no one believed the people’s words about the official sergeant.
“He has his own gang.
Who will believe in us?"
said Baker.
Joshua Tepfer, who works at the University of Chicago on acquittal project, says that until now no one really believed them.
"Everything lasted because they didn't seem to care about these people because they were black people living in social housing, so they thought they were still guilty of something," said Tepfer.
‘Sergeant Watts spent 22 months in prison in 2013 for trying to steal the FBI informant.
Martez Wise is also in prison thanks to Watts.
I was just born a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He hardly knew me, because he was just born, so I had to get back in touch with him," Wise said.
"I've wasted four years without need."
Fidelity, who has lived for 72 years, believes in the success of block circuits, virtual reality and artificial intelligence
The Fidelity block chains saw their potential before 2018 when all corporations began to talk about this technology.
Director General Abby Johnson has managed investments in cryptovalutes, the most risky and volatile asset class in recent years.
“About two years ago, I and other senior managers were just curious about what was happening, especially in the market for bitcoins,” Johnson said.
We started to negotiate, and we realized that we had to find out.
Curiousness led to the start of digging bitcoins in the New Hampshire unit, when the price of this crypto was about $180.
Last December, the price was close to $20 000 and, according to Johnson, "we were surprised: when the price went up, we started making money, although we never expected it".
It did not indicate how many bitcoins were dug or how much Fidelity earned.
"Fidelity" employees are clearly interested in these technologies.
The block chain club, named Bits and Blocks, which organizes seminars and meetings with specialists, now has around 2 600 members.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave FideLity customers the opportunity to check the crypto-luits balance using the FideLity mobile app.
In 2015, it was possible to donate funds in bitcoins.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible uses of bitcoins, or at least for a short time.
We're trying to watch the market.
In the meantime, Katie Chase, chief strategist of Fidellity Technology Centre and head of the Bloc circuit incubator (which is part of FCAT), is looking for ways to use the public and business-used block circuits.
Chase was unable to comment on specific projects, but revealed that it attracted considerable interest from customers, partners and employees.
“Everything is still very new.
If you look into the information, you will understand that there is still an attempt to find evidence of the concept," Chase said.
We have tried to apply block chains to various situations and we have learned a lot, but the technology is not yet so advanced that it can solve such problems."
In the meantime, she says that the group is focusing more on trying to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They are trying to understand how to calculate the value of physical objects, such as works of art, by means of chips or to use block chains in the supply chain.
"So far this is not at the centre of attention, but I think it will eventually get interested," Chase said.
"Fidelity will be ready for this."
As an example, she referred to the "Pebble" clock, which was completely unsuccessful in marketing standards, but ultimately paid off by Fidelity.
Her group created an app for smart clock, which was stopped production after three years, after collecting millions through Kickstarter's crowdfunding project.
When Apple Watch appeared on the market, Fidelity was ready.
She quickly applied the Pegble app for the new Apple product.
"We were not blindly convinced that the "Pebble" clock would become popular, but we wanted to be prepared if people liked smart watches," she said.
"We have accumulated knowledge and were ready when smart watches were released into the mass market."
The island of Delaware was devastated by an earthquake and a tsunami
On Friday, September 29, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a powerful 7.5-point earthquake that caused a tsunami and killed almost 400 people.
There are many injured and the number of dead is expected to increase.
According to the representative of the Indonesian disaster management agency, electricity and communication are not working, making it difficult to assess the damage in Pallu and the nearby fishing community in Dongala.
California students wore a shirt with racist inscriptions
This week, according to CNN’s KGTV branch, the Escondide School Union confirmed that about 10 students had made a ill - thoughtful decision to demonstrate racism at an event dedicated to senior classes.
"We are proud that our school accepts everyone and is not afraid of diversity," stated Adriana Lepe-Ramirez, Director.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and exclusion."
The report also states that the incident is being investigated by the Escondido High School, Union officials and local police.
"School administrators have contacted the parents and guardians of the wrongful pupils and will be subject to disciplinary penalties," the report states.
According to a report from the police station, the students of the school north of San Diego wore a picnic with letters from which the racist inscription was written, and were photographed when wearing them.
The school usually confirms the notes in advance, but after taking an official photo, some students choose their words.
The Union's report states that such behaviour "is not compatible with the culture, values or history of the Escondido high school".
"We need to understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day," said Lepe-Ramirez.
"The Escondidas High School will continue to foster a culture based on family values and unity throughout the community."
A former student, Cade Pannella, told the KGTV that an offensive photo seen in the social media angered him.
"It insults me personally," he said.
“It may have seemed funny to them, but it is not.
Only ignorant people can laugh at such things."
Shareef, son of Shaquille O'Neal, will spend the 1st UCLA season awaiting heart surgery
Shareeph, the son of Shaquille O'Neal, who is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, will have to spend the first UCLA season due to heart disorder.
According to TMZ Sports, O'Neal will undergo heart surgery in order to correct the disorder observed by UCLA doctors during routine examination.
"Thank God, UCLA doctors noticed the problem early," O'Neal said TMZ.
“During rehabilitation, I will attend lectures and be a normal student.
I'll be back very soon."
O'Neal signed an official protocol of intent in August, promising to play in UCLA team, which has already attracted a number of famous names and is one of the best first class teams in the country for the 2018-2019 season.
"Shareef improved considerably in high school," said Steve Alford, Chief Coach of Bruins last month.
“He is tall, has skills, is athletic and will be a great member of the new team.
We are happy with the composition of this year's team and Shareeph will complement it perfectly.
He's got a good base and he'll be able to improve on both ends of the court."
According to the data of 247Sports, 18-year-old O'Neal is a 4-star candidate with 8th place in the 2018 newcomer rankings as a heavy quarterback and 41th place as a player.
Before joining the UCLA, O'Neal helped Crossroads High School to achieve a record result at 25:9.
Sarah Palin's eldest son accused of violence against his father
Trac Palin was arrested in 28 years of age for three offences, including assault.
On Sunday, he was not first arrested for domestic violence.
According to the court records, the incident occurred in Palin's home in Vasila, Alaska, where Track Palin injured his father, Todd, in a dispute over the truck.
The 28th year after the Saturday incident, he was arrested for three offences, including assault.
The court documents indicate that the dispute began when the husband called to pick up the truck, but the father refused to hand it over.
As explained in the court statement, Track Palin was arrested on charges of first - degree burglary and fourth - degree assault and fourth - degree misdemeanour, and his father was wounded in the face and head.
According to the documents, Palin called the policemen who were talking to him the "prosts" and ordered him not to use weapons.
The court statement also states that the man had climbed the roof of the garage before being arrested.
Sarah Palin says in the court documents that her son was "excited" and "used some kind of medicine".
It was also recorded that Track Palin told the police that he had previously drank a few bottles of beer.
He was arrested in early 2016 and accused of domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of force.
"Seeing how my son feels, what he is experiencing when she returns, I understand other families experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and I know how injured the soldiers are returning," said the former Republican candidate for Vice President and Governor of Alaska.
"Now I understand better than ever that the best Americans need a chief executive who will respect and appreciate them."
Elizabeth Warren says he'll think about presidential candidacy after the mid-term elections
"It is time for women to march to Washington and correct the corrupt government that the woman has to lead," said the DMO Senator speaking to the crowd at the Holjok Town Hall in Massachusetts.
"So I promise you this: after 6 November, think carefully about whether it is worth noting to stand as a presidential candidate."
Warren, who tried to defend his position in competitions with Republican representative in the state Geoff Diehl, said earlier that he would not be a candidate for president because he wanted to pay attention to his work in the Senate.
"It is very important to focus on the mid-term elections and stop acting as if 2020 is the only important thing," she said when she gave a speech to the reporters at the National Press Club in August.
"The most important fight is the mid-term elections, and they are important not only for Massachusetts, but also for the whole country."
Warren has long been considered a potential candidate for the 2020 Democrat, capable of competing with President Donald Trump.
However, it would expect a hard fight for the first elections, possibly involving other well-known democrats – former Vice President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
Third mysterious death in less than a year associated with celebrities’ mental health clinic
According to The Mail, within a year, a third person committed suicide in a luxurious psychiatric clinic.
The daughter of a TV comedian, Shaquelle Vidal (23 C.E.), died on 7 April, having voluntarily spent almost a month in West London, Marylebone, a hospital in Nightingale.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57), the manager of the hedge fund, a millionaire and a former sponsor of the Conservative Party, paid her maintenance costs for five years.
The future chef died almost six months after the death of Daisy Boyd (28 y.) – a granddaughter of one of the founders of River Cafe Rose Gray.
After his separation with Dan Macmillan (43), the heir of the publishing company, Mr Boyd died under the influence of cocaine, which was illegally brought into the clinic on 5 October.
Two months ago, Alan MacDonald (61 C.E.), a filmmaker, withdrew from his life when four days had passed since he was released from the hospital.
In May, the Supervisory Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale clinic because it did not make sufficient efforts to prevent illegal substances from being added.
The daughter of Mock The Week, Avas Vidal, registered at Shaquelle Clinic on 11 March.
Last week, in the preliminary hearing of the Westminster coroner, the Royal Advocate Katie Gollop said that on 29 March Shaquelle disappeared from AWOL and returned to a mental state a week later.
Mr. Gollop, acting in the name of Avos Vidal, said: "My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquelle... who she was dealing with and what she was doing."
Mrs. Lyle was called Shaquelle's "boy."
John Gordillo (52 C.E.) of comedy, the unofficial stepfather of Shaquelle, said: "I know that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at that time."
At the meeting of Mr Gordillo, he revealed that on 4 April Shaquelle called him and told him that he wanted to buy and drink cyanide, and 20 minutes after this call he called "more than a dozen times", but no one answered.
"It seems to me that further events could have been avoided if someone had responded," he added.
On 5 April, the clinic doctor found Shaquelle's mental state to be extremely poor."
Less than 48 hours later, she hung a wire of a notebook computer.
The representative of Nightingale expressed condolences to family and friends and said: "Our clinic aims to provide high quality care in a safe and therapeutic environment."

Led Zeppelin was brought to court again because of the supposed stolen Stairway To Heaven guitar reef
Led Zeppelin was re-enforced because of the use of guitar reef in 1971 in Stairway To Heaven, which was allegedly stolen by the group.
It is said that part of the British group's hit in 1971 is plagiarized.
The Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 ruling that the group did not copy another group called "Spirit".
The claim was filed in 2015 by Michael Skidmore, the trustee of the guitarist.
It seems that litigation about the song "Stairway To Heaven" by "Led Zeppelin" will take a long time – as will the song itself.
The group will again stand before the court for accusations of stealing the 1971 Balad guitar reef.
The U.S. Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 ruling that the group did not copy the beginning of the hit from the music of the group "Spirit".
It is claimed that the court judge made mistakes, such as misinforming the jury about copyright laws.
The case was referred back to the court.
Michael Skidmore, the trustee of Spider guitarist Randy Wolfe, brought his first action in 2015.
The police chase in Michigan ended when a policeman went to them shooting a suspected murderer.
His girlfriend's alleged murder of Michigan was arrested after police chases, which ended when he crossed a police car.
It is suspected that Adam Nolin shot his girlfriend in Wyoming, Michigan, on Thursday 33, at 27, Tia Mae Randall.
He was taken to court on Friday at the hospital, where he found himself when the officer crossed him by a police SUV car, because Noline was shooting at the police in an attempt to escape on a highway with heavy traffic.
Nolin has been charged with five serious crimes, including assaults to kill and escape from the police.
"Abstraction in the hospital is not normal, but it is not the first such case," said James Maguffee, Captain of Wyoming Police.
"It is receiving the necessary treatment, but the process of justice must also continue.
Judges often adapt so that this can be implemented."
Nolin's girl's body was found on Thursday in a mobile house in the area "Creekside Estates".
The mother of two children was shot with one shot and the police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
The police then issued a public warning about Nolin and gave a brief description of the husband and his 1996 black Dodge pickup.
The man was sighted at his pickup and left for the US 131 when the police tried to stop him.
Nolin and the pickup hit the concrete wall, and then he got out of the car and ran off the highway.
As he ran, he was shooting at chasing policemen.
One policeman boarded a SUV police car and drove Noline from behind.
The observer filmed the event.
Nolin was taken to the hospital in a difficult but stable condition and would remain there until he was prescribed and transferred to Kent County Prison.
"This event showed that policemen of West Michigan risk their health in order to protect the community," Maguffee said.
"They arrested a man quite quickly and by appropriate means, and we are very proud of them."
In total, Nolin was charged with two charges of assault to kill, and he was also charged with fleeing the police, carrying a hidden weapon, and committing a serious crime involving the use of a firearm.
He hasn't been charged with his girlfriend's murder yet, because he's still under investigation.
"Of course, we are still conducting a murder investigation, which we will soon be able to submit to the Kent District Prosecutor in due time," Maguffee said.
The judge commended a courageous man who knocked out his teeth to his house for a thief who broke into his house
The judge commended the greatest of all for the courage of a man who stood against two criminals who tried to break into his house.
Although one burglar tried to hit him with a wooden board, in 63 years old David Oldham was not afraid.
A man working as a university territory overseer defended himself, struck both criminals, and knocked out one of their teeth.
The invaders fled, but after the fighting on Mr. Oldham's blood remained, which after four months was detected and arrested by Craig Ford.
In his sentence against Ford, who had lost his tooth while trying to break into Mr. Oldham's 400 000-dollar individual house in Ormskerk, in Lancashire, the royal judge Clement Goldstone said: "You probably did not expect this reaction from Mr. Oldham – when you disguised yourself to see only your eyes and nose, you encountered him in front of the house, he hit you.
He also struck your accomplice who tried to break into the second floor and jumped off the roof.
After sentenced Ford on Friday to three years and four months in prison, the judge said: “I hope you learned two lessons.
First, David Oldham should not be irritated, and second, it is better not to get involved with the police.
Because of your crimes now you have one tooth less than before and you bite the dog.
It's still a minor punishment."
He added: "I would like to commend Mr. Oldham for his response to your actions."
Prosecutor Derek Jones stated that Ford, who committed the crime, had already been convicted of another burglary in 2016 and had to remain in prison for three years, but was released on parole.
Mr. Oldham said he had danced to Liverpool's royal court when he heard a noise at the house on April 5, at about 19.00.
P. Jones said: “P. Oldham, who is a well-off man, boldly came out of his house and resisted the accused who was heading toward him.
Fearing for his safety, he struck him in the face, striking him and punching his tooth.
Then another intruder jumped off the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively punched him in the face."
According to Mr Jones, the accomplice took a wooden board and tried to hit Mr. Oldham, and Ford said: "Shoot him, he knocked out my teeth."
The accomplice told Mr. Oldham: "If you let us go, we will go" and together with Ford escaped from the crime scene.
Police captured Ford on August 2nd during a raid in a house in Wavertree district.
Ford kicked a police dog, and then he bit him in the shoulder.
It is believed that the second burglar is still at large.
He has no permanent residence for 25 years. Ford confessed guilty of burglary, beatings and dangerous driving, even though this is forbidden and he does not have a driving licence.
Thoric activists met the criticism of Johnson with applause
Tori activists today humiliated Boris Johnson by claping when he was called "a little and aggressive man".
P Johnson, who tries to please ordinary people in his uncompromising speeches about Brexito, received a strong assessment from former trade minister Digby Jones, who was also supported this afternoon by the participants of the Birmingham Conference.
David Davis also attacked Mr. Johnson because he was concerned about newspaper headlines rather than strong politics.
Speaking to MailOnline, Mr May's ally in the office of ministers added that he simply "noiseed" because he was unable to be a full leader.
The reaction came when the former Foreign Secretary again attacked the plan of the Prime Minister Chequers and called it "insanity" and "absolutely absurd".
Mr Johnson also added that he genuinely believed in the project, and she opposed the withdrawal in a referendum two years ago.
He also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May replied that her critics were playing political games and argued that they were not bluffing and prepared for difficult negotiations with the EU.
In an interview with Andrew Marro BBC, which opened the Tory Conference, Mr May said: "I believe in Brexit.
Former Labour Trade Minister Lord Jones, who is now operating independently, has received the approval of the crowd, praising the prospects of Brexito.
People applauded his opinion on Mr Johnson, who allegedly answered "fuck business" to the concerns of the entrepreneurs.
Without specifically calling Mr Johnson, Lord Jones made it clear that he was "a little and aggressive man".
"Business is very important, therefore, by saying "fuck business", the former secretary of foreign affairs showed that there is indeed a small and aggressive person," he said.
"I totally disagree with him."
Lord Jones also commended his speech in the Chamber, who watched Mr May's reaction to the "lords" of EU leaders at the Salzburg Summit on the plan of her cabinet.
Ruth Davidson, the leader of Scottish theors, also criticised Mr Johnson in the past, reminding him that he was a high-ranking government official during the Brexito negotiations.
Mr May's ally said in the Cabinet of Ministers to the newspaper MailOnline that the intervention was not very serious and that Mr Johnson did not have enough supporters among the speakers in the parliament to be able to expel the Prime Minister.
They said: “Now such news is not very dangerous.
He is making noise, but he does not have enough supporters in a parliamentary party, and he himself knows that.
We see a striking contrast between David Davis, who respectfully expressed his opinion, and Boris, who met his personal ambitions."
Business Secretary Greg Clark criticised Mr. Johnson, who attacked businessmen who were skeptical about Brexitas.
Speaking at the Tory Conference in Birmingham, Mr. Clarkas said that Mr. Johnson was "absolutely wrong".
He said: “I am surprised that someone at all might think that way.
There is no successful economy in the world that does not have successful healthy businesses."
In an interview with Sky News for Ridge on Sunday, Mr Davis acknowledged that the coming months would not be easy because the EU would try to force the United Kingdom to grant many concessions.
However, it believes that the government must not give up and seek an agreement similar to the Canadian Treaty, rather than the one proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
When asked how Mr. Johnson had succeeded in leading the Torians, he did not miss the opportunity to bite the former secretary of foreign affairs.
Smearing on Mr Johnson's proposal to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the shortcomings of British politics is politicians with fantastic ideas."
He added: "Our communication is chaotic and many of his ideas are suitable for headlines, but not for strong politics."
Bulgaria spent £80 million of European taxpayers' money on poor restoration
Bulgaria has spent £80 million of European taxpayers' money on poor restoration of ancient castles, which now seem to be made of "cheese and cardboard".
The Balkan country has spent £80 million under the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of restoring the former grandeur, the restoration was resounding.
The local authorities promised to redesign the areas near the Krakra fortress.
The Bulgarian government has spent tens of millions of EU millions on the inexperienced restoration of medieval castles.
The Balkan country has spent £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund to restore ancient castles and fortresses, but instead of restoring their former greatness, it has been harassed by construction works.
The relics after the costly reconstruction look like they were built of "cheese and cardboard", so they are no longer attractive to tourists.
For example, monument conservationists were enraged that the medieval fortress Krakra and the Roman Fort Trayanovi Vrata, near Ihtiman, in the western Bulgarian city of Pernik, were reconstructed using polymer concrete, most commonly used for paving.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian government have privately agreed that lessons should be learned from this failure.
"The fence is in a state of weeping," said architect and monument guard Stella Duleva about Trayanovi Vrata.
It has survived for 16 centuries and now it is ruined."
This reaction was received after the restoration of Krakra fort in Pernik, so the local government promised to remove the delivered parts in 2019.
The Fortress of Pernicas is called a "pile of cardboard" due to unexpected modifications.
Byzantine Yailata fort is called "cheese fortress", because it was rebuilt from smooth white blocks that are not compatible with the weather-affected facade.
These unsuccessful efforts coincide with new doubts about the way in which the European Union uses development funds.
The Stylish Bakers on their way to this year's Distinguished Gentleman's Ride
Hundreds of motorcyclists dressed in stylish costumes from all over the United Kingdom went down to the streets on vintage motorcycles in order to raise money for the Movember fund.
The event is called "The Jentelman Journey" and is organized annually in order to raise money and raise public awareness about prostate cancer.
This year, bikers gathered in London and 40 other parts of the United Kingdom, including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
This year's Distinguished Gentleman's Ride events take place in the UK and 650 other cities around the world and have so far managed to collect more than $5.5 million (GBP 4.2 million).
According to the official website of the event, this year 120 000 people were "dressed with scarfs, tie their ties, flattened their tvid costumes, sat on their classic and vintage motorcycles and allowed them to collect funds and raise awareness about men's health, especially prostate cancer and mental wellness of men".
The Distinguished Gentleman's Ride event was organized for the first time by Mark Hawk in Sydney, Australia.
The idea was inspired by the photo of Don Draper, the character of the Mad Men series, in which he sits on a classic motorcycle dressed in the best line of his own.
This year’s event in London was attended by hundreds of bikers, including sergeant Pipir, a well-dressed taxi dog.
Boris Becker of Tennis revealed that he had been treated for skin cancer
Boris Becker thanked doctors who had successfully removed skin cancer.
Becker's photos barely see a small patch in the sunglasses.
"It was a routine check and it looks worse than it is," he said to the German newspaper.
Having revealed that he has been treated for skin cancer, the tennis legend Boris Becker is photographed with a patch on his nose.
On Wednesday he published a German Twitter message about his health: "I want to thank Martin Mayr-Brune and Dr. Kati Maier from Munich, who managed to cure me."
On Sunday, the 50-year-old photos barely see a small patch in the sunglasses.
"On Monday I visited a dermatologist who removed basal cell carcinoma," said Beckeris to German publication "Image".
"It was a routine check and it looks worse than it actually is."
Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer in 75% of cases.
Once set, there is a high probability of recovery.
Beckeris is currently divorced with his wife, Lilly Becker (42), and they reported the divorce in May.
Tennis star has won six important awards in unit competitions, 13 Masters Series titles and an Olympic gold medal in a two-way competition.
He was recently seen entertaining with friends at the 185th Octoberfest in Munich.
A 24-year-old whooped at the platform of a stranger’s train did not remain silent because of body volumes
On the train platform, a British athlete attacked by a stranger on account of body volumes decided not to remain silent.
Jessica Mayho, who won the silver medal at this year's British Athletic Championship, says that he was attacked on Friday afternoon at the Lidds Station.
Mr Mayho, 24 years old and five feet 11 inches tall, said that while waiting for the train, she was pushed by a man who spoke abusively.
About 5 p.m. on the platform, an athlete was attacked by a man calling her "thick."
However, the rising sports star, who wanted a place in the British team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, turned away from her husband.
Mr Mayho, who came from the city of Kitley in West Yorkshire, said: “I was protected until other people turned their eyes on a full platform.
Such people may be intimidated and forced to lose confidence in themselves, but this is my body, my “mechanism”.
Having announced her adventure on Twitter, the young athlete received a great deal of support in social media.
Andy Lewis, the MBE's cavalry, wrote: "Stora!!!
Is he drunk or blind?
It's a fool, Jesse, you're all right.
Don't let a dumb-ass idiot ruin your mood."
Gavin Gray added: “I am disgusting.
Not only for him, but also for those around him who ignored him.
I'm glad you're okay.
You are an example for the young generation.
You showed me you should be proud of yourself, and dissatisfied can fuck off!"
She, who works at the University of Leeds, took an interest in the drop of Mr. Mayho’s hammer during her teen years and was encouraged by one of her senior sister’s coaches.
Since then, she has been able to win the second place in the Muller British Senior Championship, which took place in Birmingham in July this year.
She won the British Championship medal just a month after her victory in the North England Games.
Athlete refused to comment more on the event.
If at least 50 million user accounts are broken, Facebook will have to pay a fine of £1.25 billion
Using the security gap, criminals have been able to access at least 50 million Facebook accounts.
However, it was only three days – Friday that a major burglary was reported.
Facebook is now facing a huge fine under new European data laws
If at least 50 million accounts are broken, Facebook may have to pay a fine of £1.25 billion.
Criminals were able to access accounts due to a security gap, so many sensitive personal information could be disclosed.
However, Facebook only reported the burglary on Friday, three days later, and until yesterday evening, it could not tell how many British accounts were damaged.
As long as the search for hackers continues, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks the compliance of the web giant with the European data compliance requirements because its headquarters is located in Dublin, criticised the company, saying: "The message is incomplete."
Facebook under the new data laws of the European Union is at risk of a huge fine, as companies may be required to pay up to four percent of the world's turnover.
Facebook earned £31.2 billion last year.
Criminals have reached accounts using Facebook's View How, which allows users to see how their profiles look to others.

In the MG Baltic case, records continue to be heard: the accused discussed Gabriel Landsbergis
The hearing was opened in November 2015 between the record of former vice-president of MG Baltic, Raimondas Kurlianskis, and the record of the former "worker" Vytautas Gapšis.
While listening to the record, it is difficult to understand exactly what people who are currently indicted are talking about.
True, the record says that R. Kurlianskis and V. Gapšys talk about the Christmas celebration, several times the name of the current Conservative leader Gabriel Landsbergis appears, but what exactly is said is difficult to understand.
The accusations against both natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, three legal and five natural persons were accused: Labour and Liberal Movement parties, MG Baltic Concern, former leaders of liberals and "workers" E. Masiulis, Vytautas Gapšys, former parliamentarian liberal Š. Gustavis, Seimas member G. Steponavičius and former vice-president of MG Baltic R. Kurlianskis.
The Labour Party has been suspected of the effects of bribery and trade, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade in effects and abuse, while MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade in effects of these parties.
Officials suspect that politicians have taken or negotiated bribes with the then Vice-President of MG Baltic R. Kurlianskis, and later they have proposed or supported initiatives favourable to the concern in the Seimas and other institutions.
Former Chairman of the Liberal Movement E. Masiulis is suspected of the effects of trade, bribery and unjust enrichment, suspicions of abuse have been presented to former Vice-Chairman of the party G. Steponavičius, and bribery to former member of Vilnius City Council Š. Gustavis.
Mr Gapšys is suspected of the effects of bribery and trade, Mr Kurlanskis - of the effects of bribery and trade.
Question: Who has the greatest chance of winning the second round of presidential elections?
The poll on the second round of elections included four candidates at the top of the ratings - economist Gitanas Nausėda, Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis who had not announced himself as a candidate, and two candidates who participated in the preliminary elections of the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) party - Seimas Member Ingrida Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Usackas.
True, on Sunday it turned out that I. Šimonytė received the support of the TS-LKD in the elections, and V. Usackas withdrew from the electoral fight.
According to the data, if the elections were held in the near future, in all cases G. Nausėda would win in the second round of the President, but the leader of "Vilmorus", sociologist Vladas Gaidys says that it is too early to draw conclusions.
"It's different (from others - the DELFI) Nuse, but it's very important to watch whether about parties or about people, what dynamics are.
These doubles of Shimonytė were from one study to another, and Nausėda was stopped by growth, Ušacko was even down.
This growth is very important to you," says a sociologist.
Moreover, looking at the results of the poll, it is clear that a significant percentage of people have not yet decided what they will vote for or think they will not go to the elections at all.
If I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernelis fought in the second round of the presidential elections, the struggle would be tense - 32.7% for I. Šimonytė, 30.9% for S. Skvernelis.
True, 36.4% of the people said that they would not vote for any of these candidates, or they did not know who they would vote for or that they would not vote for.
Sociologist V. Gaidys stressed once again that we are not seeing the full picture yet, because all candidates who would apply to the less successful Lithuanian electorate have not yet announced themselves.
"If we look at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where is the Social Democrat candidate? 30 years was a candidate, won't it now?
When he announces himself, he will see how he sets out with other candidates.
Thus, the side of Lithuania, which is less successful, is less reflected so far," said V. Gaidys.
For his part, Mažvydas Jastramskis, a political scientist of the Institute of International Relations and Political Science of Vilnius University (VU TSPMI), says that it is still very early to draw conclusions, and all three candidates, excluding V. Usackas, seem to be equal.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences mean nothing.
The difference of 5 percentage points certainly does not represent an advantage for any of the candidates.
The only thing I can see is that Nausseda would look good against Usack (...) again, given that those people actually come to vote.
Naussed before the Scovernel, too, looks good, but we compare apples and potatoes now, for example, because Nausseda has already announced that he will participate, the Scovernel has not announced.
Besides, the poll was carried out before the first conservative elections, what would it look like after them?" says a political scientist.
According to him, G. Nausėda has a small plus, but after all the candidates have been announced, he may melt.
"The situation is quite even.
Nausėda, Skvernelis, Šimonytė - results are rough.
I would like to remind you that half a year before the Presidential elections in 2003, Roland Paxo had 5% support for his vote and then won the elections.
This is no prediction," M. Jastramskis said.
DELFI reminds that the candidate economist G. Nausėda, member of the Seimas I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, member of the Seimas Aušra Maldeikienė, member of the Liberal Movement Petras Auštrevičius, member of the Seimas Naglis Puteikis and member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis already exist in the presidential elections.
Iran accuses Israel of trying to commit a cyber attack
"The regime, whose history of using cyber weapons is clear from cases such as (computing virus) Stuxnet (dissemination), has this time attempted to violate the Iranian communications infrastructure," wrote Minister of Information Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi on Twitter.
He was referring to an attack by Stuxnet in 2010 on Iranian nuclear facilities.
It is believed that Israel and the United States have developed this malware.
"Because of the vigilance of our technical teams, they remained empty hands.
We will continue to talk about this hostile action in international fora," Mr Jahromi stressed.
Deputy Minister Hamid Fattashi said that technical teams recorded many attempts to penetrate their systems on Monday mornings, but that the attackers were given a 'sturdy retaliation'.
In the Health Club Impuls, a man got sick, failed to revive him
The disaster occurred at 10.40 a.m.
The man who sailed in the pool (born 1945) suddenly became sick and submerged under water.
The man was quickly pulled out of the water, but he was already unconscious.
An attempt was made to revive it.
Soon, ambulances also tried to reinvigorate him, but they failed to save his life.
On his way to the hospital, he died in an ambulance.
This disaster was commented by Antanas Sakalauskas, the head of the Health Club Network Impuls.
"We estimate that a 73-year-old man visited our wellness club in Fabijoniškės Street on Monday morning with his wife.
In the pool, the customer sailed for about 30 minutes, then sailed to the lane that separates the pool tracks to rest and suddenly collapsed after a few minutes.
The nearby people - the client who sailed in the common path and the pool manager - immediately responded, pulled it out of the water and began to revive.
The man was constantly refreshed until an ambulance arrived.
The club's staff immediately called an ambulance, which arrived within 5 minutes.
When the doctors arrived, they repaired his husband’s pulse and breath and transferred him to a medical car.
When we went to the hospital, the doctors tried to stabilize our husband’s health, but after 20 minutes we received information that the man had not survived.
We offer our sincere condolences to the family of the deceased husband for his loss.
According to preliminary data, the incident could have been caused by the client's health problems.
According to family medical information, he had diabetes.
We remind you that in the event of serious health problems, it is always very important to evaluate your options responsibly and consult doctors and health club specialists.
There is a watchman in the pool of all health clubs, whose main task is to watch the pool, its access and to ensure the safety of customers, and it is distinguished by bright clothing from other employees.
Such poolkeepers shall have radio stations which allow immediate contact with the administration and the registry, answer requests from them or call for assistance.
Four times a year there are staff trainings relating to the security programme - much more often than required by law.
During this period, staff shall develop their theoretical and practical knowledge, be trained on how to behave in the event of a disaster, and the staff shall be monitored for proper compliance with the procedures and internal rules of procedure.

Gražina, who lost her son in Norway, changed four families and stopped speaking Lithuanian
According to the LNK press release, four years ago the Lithuanian woman had no right to foster her son and to see with him the decision of the Norwegian Children's Rights Service Barnevernet and the courts.
The woman’s history has caused an almost international scandal, which was followed by all the media.
Nationals trained pickets for the return of the boy to Lithuania to his grandmother in Lithuania and Norway.
However, publicity did not help Gražina and her family to recover a son who had Lithuanian citizenship.
Today, she tells us how she has been separated from her son for the last few years, and how she and her child meet after a two - year break.
At the time when Gražina lost her right to foster her son, the boy was 8 years old, and today she is 12 years old, the beginning of adolescence.
For the first two years Gražina never saw her son, it was forbidden.
Later, Gražina was granted the right to see her son twice a year, at just one hour each.
During the last hearing, which took place a few months ago, the number of Lithuanian dates was increased to three times a year and increased to two hours.
The meetings with my son every time remind me of dates in a tight prison - watch over the officers, and the visit to them - a secret operation.
"The sons have changed four families and no longer speak Lithuanian," Gražina will open her heart this Tuesday evening, her story - on LNK show
Eligijus Masiulis will not return his personal money collected during the search
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal announced that it rejected the defendant’s appeal.
The order shall be final and not subject to appeal.
The former leader of the Liberal Movement, E. Masiulis, was tried in a political corruption case and appealed to the Appeal Court to refund him any personal money - money taken from him and the spouse's money during the search.
In total, more than 242 thousand euros were taken from Masiulis during the search.
These money are subject to a temporary restriction of the right of ownership and are regularly extended.
The last time Vilnius Regional Court extended it on 15 October.
E. Masiulis did not ask the Court of Appeal to refund all the money - he seeks to recover 800 euros from his spouse's wallet and his wallet - 690 euros, 130 GBP, 1600 US dollars.
A former politician says that the last money was spent on a planned US trip.
E. Masiulis' lawyer Mindaugas Bliuvas asked to refund this money at the hearing of the Court of Appeal on Monday because the spouses worked in well-paid jobs and had the opportunity to have such sums.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius asked the court to reject the complaint.
"The ruling of Vilnius Regional Court is lawful and justified, and no more assets are restricted, which are indicated in the complaints filed.
The court has rightly stated that it bases itself on confiscation of property as well as confiscation of expanded property," said J. Laucius at the court hearing.
On 15 October Vilnius Regional Court decided not to refund more than 242 thousand euros to the accused in the case of political corruption E. Masiulis.
This money has been found in the house and car of a former politician who has been accused of corruption during a search.
The Chamber of three judges stated that it was clear from the case file that the property rights were limited only to the funds which formed the subject matter of the criminal acts alleged against Masiulis.
"Having regard to the scope of the restriction, it must be concluded that the defendant's right of ownership is not restricted disproportionately or the restriction is applied for too long", - says the ruling of judges Nijolė Žimkienė, Jurgita Kolyčiene and Ugnius Trumpulis.
The judges noted that Masiulis was accused of committing serious crimes, that criminal proceedings were large and complex, and that it was therefore necessary to extend the time limit for limitation of the defendant's property in order to ensure possible confiscation of property and extended confiscation of property.
Prosecutors say that former vice-president of MG Baltic Concern Raimondas Kurlianskis gave a bribe of EUR 106 thousand to E. Masiulis for taking decisions useful to the concern at the Seimas.
Both accused people believe that the money found at E. Masiulis's house - EUR 90 000 - was a loan from R. Kurlianski.
According to the case data, 242.4 thousand euros, 130 GBP and 1.6 thousand US dollars were found in searches at E. Masiulis.
E. Masiulis and his lawyer repeatedly tried to recover money, but the courts rejected their requests.
A former politician has said that part of this money belongs to other persons and was intended to invest in real estate or is his family money.
He also claimed that there was no evidence that the funds would have been obtained by criminal means.
Previously, the Court of Appeal has announced that it appears from the charges against Masiulis that these funds could have been obtained by accepting a bribe of more than EUR 100 000.
Law enforcement claims that the remaining cash collected during the search could have been derived from unidentified sources of income, not declared, not documented and possibly not legal income.
Three legal persons - Labour Party, Liberal Movement, MG Baltic Group - were accused in the case of political corruption.
In addition to E. Masiulis, charges were brought against the former "worker" Vytautas Gapkis, former parliamentarian liberal Šarūnas Gustavis, Seimas member Gintaras Steponavičius and former vice-president of MG Baltic R. Kurlianskis.
R. Kurlianskis is accused of giving bribes to former parliamentarians E. Masiulis, Š. Gustavis and V. Gapšys.
Americans captured dangerous Russian fighter maneuvers
During the 25-minute takeover, according to the U.S. Navy, Russian SU-27 hurried straight through the forward plane.
The Russian plane passed through it for the second time, using the acceleration of gravity, and made a turning point.
Passengers reported a turbulence during the first approach and a quake during the second approach.
The Russian army has the right to exercise in international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We look forward to international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents that are consistent with the conduct, including the 1972 agreement on the prevention of incidents at sea and above the sea (INCSEA), - said the U.S. Navy in its report.
'Insecure actions increase the risk of miscalculation and potential collisions', notes the report.
The Russian Ministry of Defence acknowledged the incident, but said that Russian SU-27 held a "safe distance" from an American plane.
Parental expenditure continues to decrease: only up to €50 per month for extracurricular activities
According to a survey conducted by the market and public opinion research company Baltic Research, at the end of August one third (32%) of parents allocated less than 100 euros to "buy" their one school-aged child before school this year, one fifth (21%) spent between 101 and 150 euros, three out of ten (29%) spent between 151 and 200 euros, and a little less than one fifth (18%) spent more than 200 euros on preparing one of their children for school at the end of summer.
The parents, whose children started to enter the first grade this year, spent an average of 220 euros on their child's school basket, while the other parents, whose children had already graduated from the first grade, spent a lower amount on their child's preparation, an average of 160 euros.
However, as the school year progresses, there is also no cost reduction, as parents often have to flatten their wallets for children’s teams and cardepetators.
Depending on the nature of the activity, the price of a band may vary from 20 to 100 euros per country.
Parents who have children of school age were asked to say how much they plan to spend on average a month on the extracurricular employment of their one child.
A quarter (23%) of the respondents planned to spend up to EUR 20 per month on their after-school activities, a further quarter (26%) said they would pay up to EUR 50, three out of ten (31%) allocated between EUR 50 and 100 per month for the extra-curricular employment of the child, and one sixth (17%) of parents indicated that they plan to spend EUR 100 or more on this.
It is true that in Lithuania children of school age are given a non-formal children's education basket, which consists of 15 euros per month.
However, this money can only be used for one team, and if the cost of a job is higher, the difference must be borne by the parents.
If a child attends several groups or has several children of school age in the family, the cost of extracurricular activities may double.
Justina Ambrasienė, the marketing manager of the consumer loan company Vivus.lt, says that for a low- or middle-income family, saving children's teams, especially when several children are growing up in the family, can become a major challenge.
At the beginning of the school year, parents turned their heads around to get money for exercises, office supplies or new sports outfits.
Now the main concern is how to take children after school without spending a lot of money.
We note that parental spending is particularly high in August when it comes to preparing for the new school year, but it remains higher later than in summer because parents tend to invest in the employment of their children.
Often, having lacked funds and carefully assessed their possibilities, they are determined and borrowed," says J.Ambrasienė.

Kaunas residents are thrilled by the fourth decorated trolleybus
Today, the fourth exhibition of the mobile street "Atia senienos, Labas naujienos" took off to the streets of Kaunas - the old trolleybus printed with a drawing and inscription "Syenographer's inscriptions".
Kaunas City Municipality informed about the new fun trolleybus.
"This old woman, "Scoda," also changed her slightly turbulent green colour into a much more colourful and brighter clothing.
She is also a participant in the exhibition "Atia senienos, hi news!" - representatives of the municipality write next to the uploaded photo.
Mobile street art exhibition "Atia Seniors, Good News" is dedicated to farewelling old trolleybuses, which will be replaced by new ones next year.
As early as next year, the old Skoda trolleybuses will travel for a well-served rest, replaced by 85 newts and modern Solaris trolleybuses.
The portal reminds that the first trolleybus, decorated with street drawings, rolled out to the streets of Kaunas a month ago.
The trolleybus shows several well-known accents of Kaunas street art - grandfather pipe and elephant.
Less than a week after the first performance on the streets of Kaunas, the second track by street artist Timomtiej Norvila - Morfai was rolling out.
There's a funny yellow car on the trolleybus, which is often called just a "beet".
"Wanted to bring the trolleybus in.
This drawing looks very fun, especially because it also matches the trolleybus wheels.
When the wheels turn on, it seems that it is part of that car.
When we painted the wheels in white, we made them like retro-style, so the whole combination sounded very loud.
Until the trolleybus tires were painted, it certainly did not look so charming," street artist said earlier to the portal kauno.diena.lt.
On October 27th, the magnificent painting also fell on the third trolleybus.
It's white, yellow, orange, brown, but mostly blue.
This color is dominant.
On the left side of the trolleybus body is shown one of the houses of K.Donelaičio str. and on the right side the central mail.
The "Wabal" is the sweetest thing for me yet," Morphes spoke to the third trolleybus by the artist Morphes.
Buy new ones
Kaunas Day recalls that last week Kaunas bus company managing public transport signed an agreement of 29.4 million with Polish company Solaris Bus & Coach S.A indicating that Kaunas will purchase 85 new trolleybuses.
"Kaunas invests the largest amount in its history for the renewal of public transport.
This agreement will allow us to replace old trolleybuses of the Skoda brand that have served us for many years and offer the most comfortable services to passengers.
The new low-floor modern trolleybuses will have more seats, efficient cabin conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver's workplace.
The new equipment and parallel contact network renovation and street repair work will allow trolleybuses to run more reliably and much faster.
And, of course, the trolleybuses of modern design will be very decorated in the city," said Mindaugas Grigelis, CEO of Kauno Buses.
The first new trolleybuses will reach Kaunas in August next year, and all old trolleybuses will be replaced by December.
Santa Claus sensation: Queen Elizabeth II invited M. Markle’s mother to celebrate together
Duchess Meghan has enchanted the British Royal Palace.
The special gesture of Queen Elizabeth II proves this: British monarch Christmas invited Doria Ragland, the mother of the Duchess, to her palace of Sandringam, to visit the British media.
Even the parents of the Duchess Kate have no such honor.
Cat’s parents Carole and Michael Middleton and other members of her family have been invited only to traditional Christmas services with the royal family.
The unnamed source for Sunday Express revealed that the invitation to Doria Raglabd is "a sign of the Queen's respect for Meghan".
Doria claims to have charmed the queen "with her calmness" at the royal wedding in May.
The invitation to celebrate Christmas together, as well as the instigation of talks that Ragland is planning a longer stay in Great Britain.
It is speculated that she wants to help her daughter before and after birth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, should be born in the spring of 2019.
The exhibition "Women's World" will be again in Žalgiris Arena
After autumn routines and harsher weathers, the 16th time exhibition "Women's World" makes women impatient – women announce the long weekend, because four days of the hottest fashion, style and beauty news are just right here - November 8-11, in Kaunas Žalgiris Arena.
Over the years, to see how the face of the event changes, the exhibition means no longer ordinary shopping, but the tradition of giving time to yourself.
It often becomes a meeting place for friends and a reason to spend the day with a sister or a mother.
The four days of the exhibition have a special power - every woman here can learn the secrets of charm, learn tricks as to how to look glowing every day, find irreplaceable products, hear or test various procedures that stop the process of skin aging.
All this and more, promises as many as 415 participants of the exhibition, who will wait for visitors on all three floors of the Arena.
For three days there will be seminars on beauty and health, and on Sunday representatives of the fair sex will be able to hear tips to create an exclusive image from the lips of a stylist and blogger Viktorija Šaulytė.
A large proportion of women who turn around in business face finite situations, when stress begins to interfere with stable emotional and physical condition.
For this reason, Kaunas Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Crafts and the Business Women's Network operating there gave birth to the idea of holding a conference "Business and Happy. Stress-free", where discussions and practical examples will encourage you to help yourself in stressful situations and encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
As every year, the exhibition is full of events for beauty masters.
Exhibitions of long-term partners, the Association of Hairdressers and Beauty Specialists, will provide an opportunity to learn the subtleties of hair coloring and modelling from the charismatic duo of the International Academy "Vinokurov & Friends" - S. Maslov and R. Sakalauskas.
Those who want to improve even more will be waiting for the bride design contest and mastery fights "Art Battle", which will not leave indifferent.
It is as if a cherry on the cake will become a festive fiesta of the beauty world "With a birthday, Lithuania", where on the occasion of the century you will be able to see a show that has not yet been seen - from body painting to dance.
Another tradition of "Women's World" will be forgotten as well - the introductions of the latest collections of designers on Friday "Fine and Beauty Show", where they will choose the most stylish.
Supporters of handicrafts will be welcome at the "Dekostudios" workshop where they will be able to create original home furnishings for interiors or to decorate gifts more interestingly.
On the last day of the exhibition, all long-lines are especially welcome, as traditionally visitors will be welcomed by the competition "World long-haired LONG-HAIRED WORLD 2018", where new records of the longest cash register are recorded every year.
Premiere: After the introduction of the salary, teachers' salary increased by 117 euros
Since September, the average salaries of full-time teachers in the country have increased by 117 euros, confirmed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
"It is early to say how much it (new order - BNS) has advantages or disadvantages.
The fact is that those people who have full workload - their salaries increased by more than 117 euros on average," said S. Skvernelis to journalists at the Government on Monday.
He called the plans of the Lithuanian Union of Education Workers to carry out a strike for the payment of a full-time salary "democratic law", but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the education process.
"In a democratic country, all forms of protest are permitted, possible.
If you think you need to strike, it is their right to decide.
Once again, you would not want children, students, to suffer in this place.
If there is a strike, it must be carried out in accordance with the applicable law," said S. Skvernelis.
In June, the Seimas approved the model for the remuneration of teachers, which has been introduced in stages since September.
The teacher's teacher's payment was replaced by an hourly payment, which amounts to 1512 hours per year.
Teacher's working time is divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation for them and work for the community.
This reform is described by the trade union led by Andrius Navickas as absurd and outrageous that it was adopted by the 'bulder' principle and announced on 12 November that it will start an open-ended strike.
The LLAF requires the immediate abandonment of this "minimum" wage system and the introduction of a regular model with a maximum number of 18 contact hours per post.
Also - increase the coefficients of the fixed part of the basic salary by 20% and reduce the number of children in the classes.
Among other innovations, there is criticism of the introduction of a new methodology for allocating training funds, because, according to the trade union, there is not enough funding for home training, division of classrooms into groups, qualifications, educational support, and the classes in large cities have been overcrowded.
The Ministry of Education and Science stated that the regular remuneration of teachers' work would allow to regulate the workload of teachers and to compensate the school community for all the work.
It is foreseen that the teacher's post will be able to work for the community up to half of the total number of hours per year, and up to 40% of the total number of hours during the first two years of work.
The weekly working time of teachers shall be set at 36 hours, of which no more than 24 contact points per week for the compulsory subjects.
In May, about half a hundred schools of general education, kindergartens and non-formal education institutions and about 1 thousand educators joined the two-hour strike initiated by the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences.
There are about 53 thousand educators in total in Lithuania.
Invitation to be ready: a crisis can be expected in 2-3 years
The slowdown in economic growth and even the crisis can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than they were a decade ago, the interview with the News Radio programme "Business Position" said Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
"To say that the crisis is already around the corner, I would certainly not be able, but there are signs of economic slowdown.
This year our country's economy grew by more than 3 percent, and next year we are planning to grow by 2.8 percent.
The main message I would like to give to the public and business - let us be ready for everything," V. Vasiliauskas said.
He felt that crises were not the same, and they needed to be prepared differently.
The difference from the ten-year-old crisis is that the government at that time thought that the revenue generated by the growing economy would be eternal, and that this was the basis for the planned expenditure.
As a result, the crisis in 2008 has led to significant cuts in expenditure.
Now, according to V. Vasiliauskas, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"It is true that the assessment of the situation of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance is different.
We believe that we are already exceeding our potential and need to press the brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not think so," the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania said.
Preparation of the country's institutions for the upcoming crisis V. Vasiliauskas appreciates 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, the economy as small and open as Lithuania is heavily influenced by external factors.
The current movement of the great elephants - the US, China, the European Union - will undoubtedly affect us.
We therefore need to be very careful.
In a small economy, we can say that we decide everything, but I do not believe it," V. Vasiliauskas said.
What future awaits those who have taken large loans?
According to V. Vasiliauskas, the European Central Bank has a clear short-term strategy, and decisions on interest developments can be expected not earlier than next summer: 'At present, perhaps the main goal is to try to manage expectations'.
The trend, which is most worrying to the head of the Bank of Lithuania, is the decline in labour hands in our country.
"The reduction of labour hands is a significant factor in the reduction of economic competitiveness.
It is also a reduction in the number of bread eaters.
Migration this year allowed some balance to be achieved, but it is not clear whether this is a long-term trend," says V. Vasiliauskas.
ELTA recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance forecast that the country's economy will grow by 3.4 per cent this year, and by 2.8 per cent next year.
The Swedish Conservative Leader will try to shape the government again
The leader of the conservative Modest Party in Sweden, which has been in political stalemate for two months since the elections, will receive a second chance to shape the government, was announced on Monday by the Speaker of Parliament.
The moderate party of Ulf Kristerson belongs to the Alliance of the four centre-right parties, which received slightly less votes in the 9 September elections than the former ruling coalition of the centre's left.
It was difficult for the two blocs to bring together the majority after refusing to negotiate with the anti-immigration Swedish Democratic Party, whose origin is in the neo-Nazi movement.
The first attempt by Mr Kristersson to form a government on 14 October was unsuccessful.
On 29 October, the outgoing Prime Minister Stefan Lofven (Stefan Lioven) announced his failed attempt.
In an attempt to force the parties to agree, Andreas Norlen, President of Parliament, said that next week he would propose Mr Kristersson to Parliament as a prime minister, thus pushing for the first vote since the start of government-building efforts.
"It is not clear in advance whether the various parties will accept Ulf Kristerson as a prime minister," Mr Norlen said to the journalists.
However, he stressed that 'the process must move forward and the dynamics between the parties must change'.
"The fruitless negotiations must come to an end," he added.
Parliament's voting date is not yet clear, but Mr Norlen said that there was November 14 among the possible dates.
In Sweden, the Speaker of Parliament may, on four occasions, instruct any candidate to form a government that the Parliament would agree to.
If all four attempts fail, the country must hold new elections.
The current appointment of Mr Kristersson is the third attempt by Mr Norlen.
Some groups of the Moderate Party and the Christian Democrats of the Alliance's partners are pressing for the support of Mr Kristersson from the far-right Swedish Democratic Party, but he has so far rejected this possibility.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6% of the votes in the elections and is the third largest party, has long been ignored by all major current parties.
The ultra-right party, which successfully used the voters' anger over immigration during the elections, after nearly 400 000 asylum seekers have arrived in the country since 2012, demands influence in the decision-making process in exchange for support.
However, liberals and centralists in the Alliance are categorically opposed to this idea.
Since 2014, the Swedish Social Democratic Labour Party (SAP) ruled with the Greens and informal support of the Left, while it has created opportunities for cooperation between the blocs, but only if it maintains its premier position.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party have rejected this possibility.
Delegation of the Afghan Government to take part in peace talks in Russia
The Kabul government delegation will take part in the international peace talks in Afghanistan, which are being held this month in Russia, and officials announced on Monday.
The Taliban, in turn, is still considering whether to participate.
Russia announced on Saturday that it would hold such a conference in Moscow on 9 November, although the US is currently trying to enter into bilateral talks with the Taliban on the termination of the 17-year conflict.
The Afghan Government's High Peace Council, responsible for reconciliation efforts with the fighters, will send four representatives to the meeting in Moscow, and the AFP news agency was told by Sayed Ihsan Taheri.
However, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has avoided answering whether to send a delegation to this conference, which will focus on initiating peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still negotiating with Russian officials," said a spokesman, Sebagtula Ahmadis. - We welcome any peace efforts led by the Afghans.
Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujahid said that the movement is still under consideration.
Moscow also invited representatives from the USA, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet republics of Central Asia.
Pakistan, long accused of supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan, "will necessarily participate", said AFP, Ministry of Foreign Affairs representative Muhammad Faisal (Muhamad Faisal).
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has not yet responded to the request for comment.
Initially, the meeting in Moscow was scheduled for September, but it was postponed when Kabul asked the Afghans to lead the process.
The negotiations will take place at a critical time.
The newly appointed U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad (Zalmay Khalilzad) is trying to convince the Taliban to agree to the end of the war and fears that a multilateral meeting in Russia could thwart these efforts.
A U.S. government supervisory authority last week pointed out that the Kabul government's government in Afghanistan has been weakened in recent months.
Cuban President Pyongyang met with North Korean leader
The leader of North Korea, Kim Chen Unas, and the President of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canelis, both hoping to abolish US economic sanctions, agreed to expand and strengthen their strategic relations, reported on Monday by the North Korean state media.
Diaz-Canelis, who came to Asia on his first international journey after his arrival in April, flew to Pyongyang and his wife on Sunday.
At the airport, Kim Jong Unas met him, and the leaders came to the city along with the greeting crowds.
The North Korean state media reported that leaders held talks at the State Guest House Paekhwavon, highlighted the general socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide much detail, but indicated that the atmosphere of the negotiations was friendly.
The meeting with Kim Jong Un could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to secure significant progress on North Korea's denuclearisation are increasingly stalling.
Pyongyang, who has recently also sought Moscow's approval, tightens his rhetoric before this week's planned meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea's main negotiator Kim Yong Cholo in New York.
At the end of the week, Pyongyang criticised the US, through his official media, for its irrevocable sanctions, a political tool that Washington also widely used against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea has mentioned that it is capable of further developing the nuclear weapons programme if Washington does not change course.
Sanctions are an important item on the agenda of Mr Diazo-Canelli.
During last week's visit to Moscow, Mr Diaz-Canelis discussed an arms contract worth almost $50 million (43.8 million) with Russia and received a similar promise from Vladimir Putin to expand political, economic and military relations.
Both presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the US 'interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states'.
The US economic embargo on Cuba, originally introduced in 1958 and subsequently extended, remains in force.
Former so-called ‘Deputy Prime Minister’ of the so-called ‘Donetsk People's Republic’.
Mr Diaz-Canelli must leave Pyongyang on Tuesday.
He will also visit China, Vietnam and Laos.
Car safety in the parking lot?
On Saturday, the woman appealed to police officers to investigate this case of fraud.
According to Klaipėdaitė, the car of the "Hyundai Santa Fe" brand, which was produced in 2006, was left to store in the parking lot at the end of September.

Record: an athlete sailed Britain within 157 days
On Sunday, the British athlete disembarked from the sea to shore in England, becoming the first man to sail across the coast in Great Britain.
Ross Edgley (Ross Edley), 33, spent 157 days in the water and walked 2 883 miles [2883 km].
He used to swim for six hours, and he spent the night on a support team ship that accompanied him.
The last mile the athlete overcame with hundreds of fellow swimmers.
He went ashore in Margeite in south-eastern England, where Mr Edgley started his journey on 1 June.
A sportsman who planned to keep up in 100 days said to his relatives who met him on the shore: "I'm sorry, I'm late."
He said that when he got ashore, he first felt a relief.
"I was very worried that my leg would not stand," said the athlete.
The World's Open Water Swimming Association pointed out that during this endurance test, which was sponsored by Red Bull's energy drink manufacturer, R. Edgley had to deal with extreme weather conditions, and the athlete had to be worn out by jellyfish 37 times.
The organizers report that Mr Edgley has doubled the record of the longest intermittent sea voyage, which has been 73 days.
He also made a new record, probably passing the distance between the southernmost and northernmost points of Great Britain - Lands End Point and John O'Grouts.
This distance was reached within 62 days by the athlete.
Macabrian mystery of the Kleboniškis forest: one suspect has already been detained
It was a horrifying find from a passerby, because the man killed was buried in a deep burial.
It was only in such circumstances that this crime was discovered, because the victim of the murderers had no relatives and his disappearance was not reported.
According to preliminary data, he was not too old to have reached the age of adulthood.
Like the suspects of his murder.
One of them was allowed to be arrested by Kaunas District Court last week for three months.
The second, who is suspected of fleeing abroad, where he is hiding from his sentence for another crime, is still being sought.
Until he is found, the law enforcement authorities are no longer inclined to comment on the circumstances of this crime.
I. Valinskienė: I would accept many things for my children
The number of the most prominent performers in the country that will appear in the new construction of the rock opera Love and Death in Verona is expanding.
Inga Valinskiene joins the team of performers, who has been entrusted with one of the most important roles of the track - a known woman will play Juliet's nanny.
Povilas Raeškėla, who will take care of the singing of the artists, became an important part of the team.
"I think love stories from Shakespeare have been created many and very beautiful, but "Romeo and Juliet" will probably always be a symbol of these stories and will be built on various scenes for a long time to come.
It will be interesting to become a part of one of such productions", - says I. Valinskienė about the new test that fell on her shoulders.
Although a well-known woman on stage has created many roles in various performances or musicals, she has not yet had a babysitter to play.
"The time to play Juliet has already passed," smiles I. Valinskienė.
- I'd be happy to accept such an offer in my time."
True, the babysitter character in Shakespeare's drama is no less important, and some critics are even considered to be the most important.
The babysitter is not only a mediator, a helper - its method and tone of speech, the feminine attitude towards feelings and the resulting solidarity with lovers gives the story more and different colours.
In addition, the nanny is important because it is one of the only two women in the drama Romeo and Juliet.
"The golden character is not very close to my way and style, but sometimes it's just more interesting.
To create a different character than it has itself - a fun part of the creative process.
So far, I do not know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the interpretation of the director, - says I. Valinskienė and reveals that as Juliet's nanny, he would probably do the same.
- I think the babysitter was listening to his heart.
This is what most women do.
That's what I'd probably do."
The legendary Kęstutis Antanelis rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" is created by the famous Shakespeare drama "Romeo and Juliet".
A work based on real facts tells the tragic ending of the love story of two young people - Romeo and Juliet.
The sad outcome of history is due to the uncertainty about where the conflict between young people's families - Monteki and Capulettes - comes from.
"At all times, all kinds of stories are possible.
Parents who are against the choice of their children have always been and will be.
Only today the solutions to such problems - more diverse ones - were asked whether Romeo and Juliet's story could be repeated today, says the future nanny Valinskienė.
"For the very sake of my children, I would make peace with many, including my daughters-in-law."
The main roles of the rock opera directed by the actor and director Ramūnas Cicėnas - Romeo and Juliet - will be performed by Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justinas Jarutis; Vidas Bareikis, Kęstutis Cicėnas, Mindaugas Papiulis, Marius Jampolskis, Paulius Šinkūnas and Aidas Barkauskas will also appear on stage.
The latest presentation of the rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" will be presented to the audience at the end of December.
On the 28th of December, the first legendary piece of new colours will be seen by spectators of Vilnius Siemens Arena.
The day later, on December 29th, the rock opera will be shown in Klaipėda "Švyturys" Arena.
E. Jankauskas announced with whom footballers will complete the League of Nations tournament

At the national team G. Sirgėdas debuted at the age of 18, after the successful 2013 European U-19 championship.
During the European Youth Championship in Lithuania G.Sirgėdas scored 3 goals and became the most successful priority player and was elected to the symbolic team of the championship.
Later, however, a career in football was hindered by trauma.
After a two-year break, another representative of Kauno Žalgiris, Markas Beneta, received an invitation to the team.
In October, the defenders Egidijus Vaitkūnas and Edvinas Girdvainis, who have missed the League's games with Romania and Montenegro, returned to the formation.
"We will strive to win the first points in the League of Nations, even though there are very difficult duels in rival squares.
At home, we lost both Serbs and Romanians with a minimal difference.
There was also a lack of success.
We hope that our guests will be able to reconvene.
Even though this is a decisive battle for the first place in the group and the opportunity to continue the fight for the trip to the European championship", - said E.Jankauskas, the trainer of the Lithuanian national team.
Two tours before the end of the League of Nations group competitions, division C 4 is going on a very hard fight.
After four rounds, a team with 8 points in Serbia is leading.
Montenegro is just a little behind the leaders, and Romania is the third one in two points.

"Skamp" presents a song whose video has already refused to show one TV
The group "Skamp" started to create music intensively this year and again.
Having announced the only anniversary concert "Skamp20" to take place in Vilnius Siemens Arena on 26 December, the trio presents new works one by one.
This time it's Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow and a brave song video.
"This track is about love, so I thought that all kinds of relationships, regardless of age or sexual orientation, should be perpetuated in the video," Erica Jennings reveals the idea of a new song and video clip, which is convinced that any manifestation of homophobia in 2018 is not normal.
The video of the new song "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" filmed over ten pairs of different orientations and ages: "We always supported LGBTQIA communities and believe that one day we will not have to discuss this", says Viktor Diawara, who created music at the beginning of the year during family holidays in Israel.
It is true, because of this video, Skamp has already had negative reactions - he was reluctant to show one of the country's most popular broadcasts.
This tells us a lot about our society.
The TV will not show the video because it is kissed by people and it is supposedly the wrong content for children.
What about the fact that at any time of the day TV can be set on the screen for the fights and other examples of violence?' - Mr Jennings asks rhetorically.
Ericis also doubles Vilius Alesius: "I would like to see more people clinging and kissing around, regardless of their social status, gender or age.
We raise children and want them to grow up in an environment with as much tolerance and as little bullying as possible.
We want a new song and video to make the day of our listeners clear a little and give them a smile."
Since 1998, the Skamp group has been famous for its brave lyrics in which she spoke on unpopular or sensitive topics.
All the best songs of the groups - old and new - will be heard at the "Skamp20" concert already on 26 December in Vilnius Siemens Arena.
Everyone with their families is welcome, and children under 10 years of age are free to enter.

Presidential Palace: LRT is not the property of politicians
When the Seimas intends to return to the consideration of the conclusions of the commission which has investigated the activities of the LRT, the Presidential Palace fears that those who rule simply seek to gain more political control over the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is not the property of politicians, and the fundamental principle is to maintain that independence from politicians," the adviser to the President Mindaugas Lingė explained to the News Radio.
However, the adviser pointed out that the opposite can be seen at the present time.
"It can be seen that those (political. - ELTA) influence is wanted to have more.
This is what we are critical of," said M. Lingė.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT commission acting at the Seimas are questionable and questionable because it targets the independence of the broadcaster.
Although Mr Linge stressed the need to improve LRT governance, this should be done on the basis of expert assistance and on specific aspects that hinder the smooth operation of LRT.
He stressed that already now the international institutions stressed that the LRT's activities should be supervised by the competent authorities rather than the political authorities.
On Tuesday, the Seimas intends to take a decision on the conclusions of the commission which has investigated LRT activities.
These conclusions have come to light with much criticism.
The proposals to change the governance of LRT have been evaluated very sceptically - to reduce the powers of the Council and to link the terms of office of its members to those of the appointing authorities.
In this context, the European Broadcasting Union expressed its concern.
In January, the opposition group of the Seimas Members appealed to the Constitutional Court regarding the compliance of the special parliamentary commission examining the activities and finances of the LRT with the Constitution.
For those working abroad - good news from R. Karbauskienė
The Seimas began to consider the amendment to the Law on Declaration of the Place of Residence, presented by Ramūnas Karbauskas, the elder of the Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union, according to which citizens working and paying taxes outside Lithuania would be exempt from compulsory health insurance contributions.
After the presentation of the draft, 56 Members of the Seimas supported the draft on Tuesday, 9 against, and 25 MPs abstained.
The Seimas also decided to ask for the Government's conclusion.
According to the proposed project, the persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the states of the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation shall, by a decision of the administration agency of the State Social Insurance Fund, be exempt from compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania.
Residents and working outside Lithuania, according to the data submitted and approved by the State Social Insurance Fund Board (Sodra) and the State Tax Inspectorate, would be considered to have left Lithuania.
It is about services that a person does not use.
There are additional possibilities to record the fact that a person has left," R. Karbauskas explained from the Seimas Tribune.
Such proposed legal regulation, according to the Conservative Antanas Matulas, would be unfair to citizens living and paying taxes in Lithuania.
"Part of Lithuanians living abroad abuse this," noted Matulas.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sys believes that in this way we are calling on citizens not to comply with their obligation.
In his opinion, it would be possible for the cunnings to use the health care system free of charge.
The adoption of the proposed amendments to the law will ease the burden of managing Sodra's debts by paying social security contributions to persons who have moved to other countries.
Currently, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania but have not declared in accordance with the procedure laid down by legal acts in the Residents’ Register of departure are subject to monthly compulsory health insurance (PSD) contributions, and if they are not paid, they accumulate their debt.
A. Duonėla convicted of fraud but acquitted for counterfeiting
Vilnius Regional Court has upheld the sentence of Alvydas Duonėla, a former famous sportsman convicted of an attempt to cheat, but he has been acquitted for document fraud.
On Monday, the verdict of the court came into effect immediately.
A. Duonėla has been sentenced to imprisonment for three and a half years, with deferment of execution of the sentence.
This March, the multiple Lithuanian kayaking champion was sentenced to Vilnius City District Court.
He was sentenced to three and a half years in jail.
Having examined the case according to the complaint of the convicted person, the Vilnius Regional Court removed one charge, but the penalty remained the same.
A former athlete will also have to pay almost EUR 760 to the Crime Victims Fund.
The prosecutor's office accused A. Duonėlas of falsifying a bill in 2013, which he lent 200 thousand litas (about 58 euros) to his dental office headed by his former wife, Dalina Burokaite.
The spouse learned about this only in December 2016 when he received calls for debt repayment.
The former spouse said that she had never borrowed money from her husband for the needs of the clinic and had not signed the bill.
According to the judges of Vilnius Regional Court, there are no objective data in the case to prove that it was A. Duonėla who would have entered the false data that UAB "Dalecija" allegedly owes A. Duonėla 200 thousand litas.
It is acceptable to agree with the arguments set out in the complaint of the convicted person and his defender, there are no objective data in the case confirming this.
Having established in this way that A. Duonėla has only used a false real document for fraud and acknowledging that this attribute - the use of a false document - is an integral part of fraud (in the case under consideration - attempt to commit fraud), A. Duonėla is acquitted in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code without proving that he was involved in the commission of a criminal act", - says the Vilnius Regional Court ruling.
Firefighters used to take the cats buried in the ground - they heard the knuckle for three days
According to the information received from the Kaunas County Fire and Rescue Board, the cat buried after the change of the heat pipelines is stunned for three days.
When the firemen arrived, they also heard the cat slumber.
It was discovered that a few days ago, the thermal track was being repaired here.
It is assumed that when the track was buried under the overlay, two cats could have been buried in the ground.
The firefighters dug out the thermal track overlay, which was one and a half feet [1.5 m] deep, and struck out the space for cats.
The son of Antonino Scalia says that his father would not be surprised by the protests of liberals over Kavanaugh
On Sunday, the son of the late Supreme Court judge Antonino Scalia said to Fox News that his father's protest of unsurprising extreme forces against the nominated judge Bretta Kavanaugh, because Scalia thought that the Supreme Court was too meddling in the affairs of the modern world.
"In general, he would not be very surprised by the noise of nomination to the Supreme Court, because many rely on the Roe before the Wade case – at least the left says so," said Christopher Scalia, reminding of the famous 1973 case, followed by the constitutional right of women to abortion in certain trimesters.
The Roe case, in one way or another, overturned the rights of all states to regulate abortion themselves and some states, in response to this decision, immediately tried to restrict the right to abortion.
"My father often said that Roe before Wade and in other cases, the court actually tried to solve cultural problems, even though they had to be solved during the elections and the legislative process," he added at the Fox & Friends show."
"In order to speed up the proceedings, the Supreme Court has caused even more damage, so nominations to the Supreme Court and disputes over approval cause a stronger reaction, because judges take on the role of legislators."
The Nebraska Senator, Republican Ben Sasse, expressed a similar view at this month's meeting on the approval of Kavanaugh, repeating that Congress often gives too much power to executive authorities, which are not essentially accountable to anyone, and leaves the bureaucratic issues that arose to the Supreme Court, so judges must take the job that the senators refuse to do.
Police on the Capitol Hill arrested and accused hundreds of protestors of illegal interference in the candidate's approval process.
When asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid the hostile reaction to the unconfirmed accusations of sexual misconduct he allegedly committed several decades ago, Scalia said that it would probably not be possible to avoid noise.
In response to statements that Kavanaugh should not hold office in the Supreme Court, because on Thursday, during the interview with the senators responded fervently and sometimes insolently, Scalia questioned whether all the judges had a calm character.
"Judges often get angry," said Scalia talking about malicious disagreements that sometimes arise in controversial cases.
"The truth is, Judge Kavanagh must have reacted more aggressively, but this was different.
He tried to defend his good name against unconfirmed accusations."
On Thursday, in the Senate Court Committee, Kavanaugh was allowed to take part in the entire Senate vote by a majority of the party's votes (11 against 10) .
The senator of Arizona Republican Jeff Flake stated at a dramatic moment that he would give his decisive vote to Kavanagh only if the FBI were given a week to investigate the current alleged accusations against Kavanagh.
The investigation is still ongoing, and President Trump said that the agency has a broad mandate and can question "whatever it wants".
“Schiaparelli” ready-made clothing collection – fantastic clothing
Is surrealism possible?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
The fashion house in Paris, founded almost a hundred years ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, introduced its first collection of ready-made clothes and handbags.
Fantastic rather than wearing ready-made clothes for the brand, this collection is almost as incredible as Elsa Schiaparelli's famous overturned shoe cap.
This time fashion houses that have long cherished the eccentric image appeared as very modern.
In aesthetic decisions you will find emoticons, lobsters, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli created her first suit in 1930 and was the first designer whose models marched in the podium by music.
She and her friend Salvador Dally have come up with a combination of art and fashion, and now Calvin Klein and Rafas Simons have taken over this idea, working with US artist Sterling Ruby.
The legend is that Dale, together with Schiaparelli and the lobster motif, wanted to apply the evening dress before the demonstration a true mayonnaise, but did not receive approval.

"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is inseparable from the story of Schiaparelli," said Bertrand Guyon, who has been working as a creative director for the past three years, who was interviewed in a fashion house in Vandom Square.
In creating a collection of ready-made clothes, he referred to Schiaparelli's friendship with Man Ray and worked with the My Ray Foundation to create clothes based on well-known works of art.
The famous picture of the artist's eyes "Stikle tears" is shown on T-shirts, which are covered with "Perspex" tears, and red lips from "Observatory Time: Lovers" are printed on a true silhouette dress with collage by silkography.

One of Elsa's strange features was the superstitious urge to the letter by S. Her brand color – "Schoring Pink" inspired her perfume "Schoring".
The first Schiaparelli handbag, created by Guyon, with a key hole on the buckle, is called the Secret.
Its retail price will also be fantastic – £5,000.
Yesterday, a temporary store was opened in a warehouse on the left bank of Senna, where the surrealist side of the Paris fashion week was shown and for 100 € it was possible to buy Virgil Abloh carpets from the upcoming Ikea collection.
Half an hour before the opening, more than 500 young Abloh fans lined up on the pier in line, eager to buy one of his works at more favourable prices than Louis Vuitton's men's clothes.
Ablohui’s project helps to reach a wider audience than the one with luxury fashion or designer furniture.
“No one has any property, but knowledge of a certain chair can help you to start a dinner conversation.
This is what the millennium generation thinks," he said recently.
spectators gathered in Marais region realized that this event in the garage would not be a common event when the models started driving through them on skateboards.
The collection of free colorful men's and women's cloaks by Vivienne Westwood's husband designer Andreas Kronthaler was based on the portraits of Jessica Fulford-Dobson Kabul skateboarders.
Some women (and a few men) who were wearing high heel sandals were on skateboards, but they were on their own.
Westwood, who watched the show in the first row and wears a collection dress with horse motifs and an orange cardigan tied across the waist, joined her husband who gave her a bouquet of flowers for her last bowing down on the podium.
Strong twin connection in photos
Peter Zelewski, born in Detroit and residing in London, was already established as a street photographer when four years ago he started taking pictures of twins.
“I, as a portrait photographer and a person, have always been fascinated by the twins and their extraordinary connection, which everyone is talking about,” he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, but, according to him, "I gained an addiction by photographing the portrait of the first twins and there was no way back".
The book "Twins" by Zelewski, which will appear shortly, will publish photographs and stories of 44 identical twin couples.
This project is more visual, he says: "This is not a documentary or scientific project – I wanted to take a picture of the affected and sensual portraits of people."
Nurses expressed distrust of the trade union negotiating wages
Members of the Royal College of Nursing who were dissatisfied with the trade union's deal with the National Health Service on salaries, expressed distrust of the union after the vote and accused it of distorting the demands for wage increases expected.
This unprecedented decision follows on from the lengthy discussions at the Royal College of Nursing, when his former Secretary-General Janeta Davies admitted that he had falsely promised members that their salaries would immediately increase by 3% this year, when the 1% salary limit would be lifted.
Before the expected rise in salaries, members became angry and forced Davies to withdraw from office, then petitioned him, and held an urgent meeting in Birmingham on Friday, after which the College Council expressed its distrust.
“A fair and open debate in Birmingham helped to clarify the relationship, so the college will only strengthen,” said Maria Trewern, Director of the Royal College of Nursing.
“The vote is clear and the council and the management of the Royal Nursing College understood the message sent to it.
The Council has already sought change in the organisation in recent weeks and has tried to listen to the Members' words and involve them; we will continue our efforts to achieve this."
The meeting will take place next week and the Royal Nursing College is expected to withdraw.
"The basis of care is trust," said the nurse of the National Health Service to the newspaper Guardian.
“The actions of the Royal Nursing College Council have destroyed trust in it, so the Council must withdraw.
I hope that she will act with dignity and listen to the request.
I wonder whether members of other trade unions will also seek restructuring."
In the National Health Service Rachel Harrison, State Official of the General Trade Union, said in August, "After receiving salaries, employees of the National Health Service from all over the country realized that they had not received a expected raise.
It made them angry."
Before the unusual meeting, the Royal Nursing College acknowledged that it made mistakes in the salary negotiations in 2018 and poorly informed about them.
However, it is also claimed that the Royal College of Nursing campaign to lift the wage restraint forced the government to waive this restriction and to pledge to gradually increase wages by 6.5% over three years.
The vote follows an independent study that found that the College was inclined to go down in the negotiations and that Davies was accused of underestimating the transaction.
It is claimed that the Royal College of Nursing provided information which was inconsistent with the facts and that therefore the members were not in a position to make a reasoned decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The College has published contradictory information on whether all employees will receive a 3% increase in wages.
The brief report before the College meeting erroneously stated that "a 3% increase and an increase in the pace of reform" was planned.
Indeed, wages should have been gradually raised to 3%, and only some of the highest wage earners would have immediately received an increase.
"Almost all the information provided to members after the meeting about the implementation of the transaction was wrong (probably due to attempts to simplify it)", said the representative of the Election Reform Service who carried out the investigation.
‘The ERS considered that the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction and the main advantages, including the 6,5 % and 29 % calculations mentioned during the campaign, were not explained in an intelligible and concise manner to the decision-makers and that it was therefore not possible to make a reasoned decision.’
The decision to express distrust was supported by 78% of the votes cast and 3.74% of the members of the Royal Nursing College took part in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan shocked Instagram live streamers by trying to "abduct" children from the family
Lindsay Lohan was criticized for the live broadcast of Instagram, during which she followed the homeless family on the street and tried to separate her sons from her parents.
At the beginning of the live broadcasts, most likely filmed in Moscow (deciding according to Lohan's earlier update of Instagram history), the actress offered to provide a place for the family overnight accommodation, but the situation quickly complicated.
“Hello for everyone! I want to show the family I met,” she said to the audience, “they are refugees from Syria, and I am very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me?
Come, I will take care of you," she said before turning to one of the children: "Would you like to stay in a hotel?
Watch movies?
It would be nice to watch a movie on TV or a computer."
When his parents refused, Lohan responded with opposition.
“Your children should not be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
“If someone offers them a home and a place to stay, as I do now, you should agree.
They'll come back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't fuck with me."
When the family tried to withdraw from Lohan by walking down the street, the actress continued to follow her by broadcasting it directly through Instagram.
“Look at what's going on – it's child trafficking, so you spoil Arab culture.
You're marrying children, even though they don't want to go with you.
Boys, don't worry, I'm with you and now the whole world sees us."
The broadcast ended with a physical confrontation – the mother seemed to hit Lohan.
Video clips spread on the social media, and some users were interested in whether this could not have been equated with an attempt to kidnap.
The Independent contacted Lohan's representative for comments.
One third of the British people think they'll never pay off all the debts they have
Almost a third of Britishs believe that they will not be able to cover their debts during their lifetime, and one in 10 people believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study carried out by Equifax and Gorkana, the results of which were disclosed only to The Independent, showed that the British people, especially those in the 18-24 age group, believe that they will have debts for the rest of their lives, and only half of them expect to get out of them.
Last year, a report published by the Institute of Fiscal Research shows that students who have completed their studies are left with about £46 000 of debt, while the poorest are left with over £57 000 of debt.
Most graduates (81 percent) will never pay out their full debt, so for the first 30 years they will work under debt.
Public debt is rising: according to the National Statistics Department, the debts of UK families are record levels and Britishs spend on average £900 a year more than they earn.
But is there any reason to worry about this spooky statistics?
Are all-century debt simply a new way of life for young adults (and society as a whole)?
One example of this is cars that are another big purchase that is bought at home (if such a success is smiled).
Auto Trader this week predicted that in a decade, all new cars will be purchased by hire – this will be the usual way of purchasing vehicles.
Jeannie Boyle, Director of EQ Investors and Certified Financial Planner, believes that expectations have really changed.
"It is really normal nowadays to have debts: credit cards, interest-free refinancing, student loans and fast credits have become popular," she said.
"The generation of our grandparents was ashamed to have debts."
Today, debt has become a normal phenomenon due to student debt and house prices.
This statement is also supported by Moira O'Neill, the head of the personal finance department of Interactive Investor, who believes that the results may be worrying.
"If you borrow a huge amount, which is four or five times your income, it may seem that additional debts will not mean anything," she explained.
And that's how people get into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so people with large loans or other debts need to think about what would happen if the rates rise."
It should probably not be surprising that the commentators in the financial industry have no doubt about it.
Brian Brodie, CEO of the loan agency "Freedom Finance", says: "The loans are not taboo.
The loan for the purchase of a house repair or a new car is no longer considered as a last resort.
Low interest rates have helped many people to save on fixed-term deposits with higher returns, but it is not so easy to achieve savings.
As a result, the middle class is increasingly borrowing.
Over the past six months, about half of the new loans have been taken by customers with an excellent creditworthiness assessment."
Richard Haymes, Head of Financial Problems Management Division of Equifax, believes that such expectations – to stay away from debt for the rest of your life – are really worrying.
He says: “In August, inflation peaked in six months (2.7 percent), interest rates rose, and earnings rose modestly, so many people are concerned about the decision to borrow without a realistic plan to pay off their debts.
Our analysis has shown that this year the number of bankruptcies will increase by 17 percent, and the main determining factor is record consumer borrowing."
Debts may not cause much trouble while a person is working and earning, but it is not clear how life’s unsettled debts will affect his well - being in old age.
A study of the Centre for Economic and Business Research, carried out together with more 2 Life mortgage lending specialists, showed that in the last four years, debts that were not guaranteed by people between 55 and 74 increased by more than a third, i.e. more than twice the national average.
This age group usually borrows through credit cards and spends 30 percent more on a monthly basis than it earns.
Boyle added: “A growing number of people at the age of 55 choose to pay their debts from pension funds, which will affect their retirement lives.
Most often, these are the only savings that they "must" have saved.
In addition, people think that using wealth will pay off later, but a change of property to cheaper ones does not get as much money as expected.
If property prices fall, this situation will only get worse."
Singed to the side, Serena Williams sang I Touch Myslf to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams released a video in which she sings the classic Divinyls song I Touch Myself, covering her naked chest with her hands.
Tennis ass shared the video on her Instagram page and explained that she had created the video to encourage women to check their breasts themselves.
"In this month of the fight against breast cancer, I recorded the version of The Divinyls' global hit I Touch Myself in order to remind women to check themselves regularly," wrote Williams.
“This is how I left my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because this problem affects women of all races around the world.
Early detection is the key to saving many lives.
I hope I can remind women of this."
Williams continued: "This music clip is part of the project "I Touch Myself Project", which is implemented in honor of the famous Chrisy Amphlett – she died of breast cancer and gave us her hit to remind women first of all to take care of their health."
The project supported by the bottom knitwear brand Berlei for Brest Cancer Network Australia (BCNA) started in 2014 after the death of 53 years Amphlett.
The video, which the tennis star announced in her Instagram account, received over 1.5 million views and many fans were praised for the way the tennis player sang the song.
“Worthy wishes for this video and your courage to do so.
Thank you, Serena," wrote one fan.
Another added: “Serena, that’S NOT a good idea.
20 years ago, I had breast cancer and found a nodule myself, even when the mammograms did not show anything.
You just have to check it out.
Thank you for not being afraid to leave the comfort zone – you are a goddess!"
The Berlei project I Touch Myself Project also released a new snake skin pattern bra The Chrisy inspired by a rock star.
100 percent of the profit from the sale of the bra will be sacrificed to the BCNA.
It is important to know which signs and symptoms to look for.
Signs of breast cancer include not only nodules, but also abnormal breast size or shape, rashes or cuts, nipple discharge, skin pitting, persistent pain or changes in skin texture.
In addition, swelling at the armpit or crucible, swollen veins, and pitted nipple can be a warning for cancer.
It is recommended that women check their breasts monthly.
If you notice any signs of breast cancer, you should contact your family doctor immediately.
If your family doctor considers that you need additional evaluation of your symptoms, he will send you to a breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driver made the whole FNL shooting group squash
Adam Driver was this week's "Saturday Night Live" invited star and actually tried to make everyone laugh.
The best jokes of the show are usually not related to a specific relevant event – as well as a new parody called Career Day.
The day of the U.S. high school, when the students bring their parents, and the teenager Mortdecai (Pete Davidson) reluctantly agrees that his father, the old oil magnate Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driver) would give a speech.
Parnassus, who could be inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis' character Daniel Plainview from the film "Bus blood", tells a vivid story of how he has dominated the oil industry.
"I was born seven months too early," says Parnassus to his students.
“Incubator technology was just invented, so I was put in a cast iron pot and heated in a pizza oven until I learned to walk.
My bones never hardened, but not my spirit.
Be strong and crush your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague SNL actress Aidy Bryant, who plays as a teacher, barely keeps up and can't look in the eyes of Driver.
However, the jokes of the actor of Star Wars are only gaining momentum and he begins to talk about a personal war with another oil magnet H.R. Pickins.
"I married your granddaughter!"
"I filled her belly with my rotting seeds and ruined your boy – this is my ultimate revenge, H.R.!"
In less than five minutes Parnassus became Adam Driver's most memorable character as Kyle Ren of two movies.
"Be cursed, H.R.!"
Leaked songs by Kendrick Lamar: eight unheard tracks appeared on the Internet
Looks like a lot of unreleased Kendrick Lamar's songs have been stained.
On Saturday, eight unheard-of works were distributed on the Internet, the parties of which were performed by SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Abby Soul.
It is not clear where the songs came from, and the name of the collection "Bad Kid Chill City EP" and the picture of the cover (likely created by the fan) are not official.
It is possible that only demonstration and unfinished versions of songs have been leaked, as if they had been recorded at different stages of Lamar's career.
Gang Member could belong to the Good Kid Maad City era, and Heroin, sung together with SZA, is more similar to DAMN./Black Panther soundtrack.
The following songs are distributed in the collection:
Gang Member;
"The Onlyy Nigga";
"Want In Life";
Loved Ones (with SZA);
"Own This City";
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jay'um Rocku, Isaiah Rashad and Ab Soul)`;
Look Over Your Shooters (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
Swimming Pools Alternate.
The Independent contacted Kendrick Lamar's representative regarding the comment.
The confusion about the musical "Chicago": if there are no tickets left in Klaipėda, we invite you to go to Vilnius or Kaunas
Lithuanian desire to see the musical "Čikaga" of Klaipėda State Musical Theatre - does not stop.
For this reason, perhaps the most popular Lithuanian musical of all time took off for another tour during the biggest arenas of the country.
However, about 1.5 months before the show, places in the halls become scarce.
Organizers announce that all tickets to the musical in Klaipėda Švyturys Arena have already been sold, tickets to the performances in Kaunas Žalgiris Arena and Vilnius Siemens Arena are rapidly melting.
There are no tickets in the port city for some time, so everyone who wants to see this indifferent left-over musical is invited to go to Kaunas or Vilnius, where there are still some tickets.
The performances will take place in December, so coming from the distance not only will see our musical, but will also have a great opportunity to see the trees of the largest cities in the country", - Laima Vilimienė, the Head of Klaipėda State Theatre, offers a solution to the fans of the musical.
In December, the audience of "Chikaga" will be met with a slightly changed composition of the artists.
One of the main roles of the musical was first entrusted to actor Thomas Jaib.
The talented and well-known actor in Chicago from the TV screens will embodies the incredible Billy Flynn, the best and most influential Chicago lawyer, without scrupulous changes to people's fate.
Since the musical of Klaipėda State Musical Theatre "Čikaga" is adapted to larger spaces, arenas, the composition of the artists appearing there is also larger than the work displayed in Broadway.
Almost fifty artists appear in Lithuanian Chicago.
The main roles of women are entrusted to the charming soloist Beata Ignatavičiūtė of Klaipėda State Music Theatre (the murderer Velma Kelly) and the charismatic soloist Gabrielė Bielskyte of Kaunas Music Theatre (the killer Roxie Hart).
The musical "Chicago" represents the criminal world of Chicago in the 1920s, which transforms the walls of the prison into a hill of stars.
It is a musical satire of criminal justice, telling about two killers seeking attention and recognition.
The musical is pervaded by sexuality and irony.
No matter where the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - are, the meaning of life - to shine with a shining star.
Their life is the life on the first page of the message, the title, the glitter, the alley of glory...
On 13 December, Chicago will be shown in Klaipėda Švyturys Arena, on 18 December - in Kaunas Žalgiris Arena, on 20 December - in Vilnius Siemens Arena.
Tickets are distributed by Tiketa.
Living room furniture in Kaunas
The website can be called a representative home area, where we spend time with friends, welcome guests, etc. Therefore, it should be arranged in such a way as to be convenient not only for the owners of the apartment or the house, but also for the guests.
Depending on the size of the living room, walls, ceiling decor, the taste of the owners, you should choose the appropriate furniture.
The site should not only be beautiful, but also convenient.
It is best to invite an interior designer to help you fill the space optimally, so that it is not overloaded or vice versa - too empty.
It is advised to determine first the main point of the website, i.e. the object to which you will combine furniture, other details.
This can be a fireplace or other important site interior accent.
It would also be great to create a chat space where guests can communicate in a comfortable way, so that they do not be disturbed by outside furniture, etc.
Sofas, chairs should be placed close to each other so that your guests can sit down and talk.
So the arrangement of furniture must encourage communication, unite people, not distance them from each other.
Do not push the furniture against the wall.
Depending on the size of the room, what distance should be from the walls.
Even though the room is small, still leave at least a little space from the wall, do not push the furniture close to it.
If the room is large, leave even more space away from the walls.
In fact, the greater the distance, the better.
Building a balance by putting the furniture together
Consider the size and location of various details that will be available on your site.
All elements must be compatible with each other.
Living room furniture must be compatible with interior details.
A slight contrast is possible.
It will invigorate the interior of the site, but it should not be too big because the interior will become tasteless.
We advise you to always consult with interior designers.
If you do not have the necessary knowledge, you risk moving to extremes: you will either create a boring interior because you will be afraid to experiment, make mistakes, make inappropriate choices, or overdo it with improvisation.
Proper lighting
This is an extremely important point.
After all, different light reveals space in different ways.
Lighting must be arranged at various levels: ceiling luminaires, wall luminaires, floor-mounted luminaires.
Prosecutor's Office appealed the acquittal sentence against heads of LKF
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office appealed the acquittal sentence of Vilnius Regional Court against former heads of the Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF).
According to the Office of the Prosecutor's Office on Monday, the complaint indicates that Panevėžys City Municipality had no legal basis to contribute monetary funds from the municipal budget to the reconstruction of the private hotel in Panevėžys.
In the course of the pre-trial investigation, it was established that in 2010 a service contract was concluded between the Lithuanian Basketball Federation and Panevėžys City Municipality in order to find the possibility to finance the reconstruction of the hotel.
Prosecutors state that the Federation did not intend or could not provide the services which according to the said contract had to be provided to the municipality of Panevėžys, because the planned services had already been received or planned to be financed by the State and sponsors, a part of the planned events had already taken place before the signing of the agreement and had already been paid from other funds, and a part of the events had already taken place after the VAT invoices were issued - the money was transferred according to the invoices for the events that had not yet taken place.
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office states that it disagrees with the conclusion of the Court of First Instance that the State itself obliged and commissioned the Municipality of Panevėžys to carry out the reconstruction of a private hotel, since no obligation of the State for a specific hotel was expressed, only the suggestion to the Municipality of Panevėžys City to resolve the issues of the development of hotels necessary for the championship as soon as possible.
In the opinion of the Prosecutor's Office, the court unreasonably stated that the heads of the LKF and Panevezys municipality tried to fulfil the state obligation without having a legal road to that effect, because the data in the case showed that there was a possibility to organise the matches of the European Basketball Championship Group in other cities without violating the law.
By appeal, the Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office requests the annulment of the acquittal of the court of first instance and in this case the adoption of a new - a convict - judgment on seven natural persons and one legal person.
On 15 October, Vilnius Regional Court fully acquitted Mindaugas Balčiūnas, Secretary General of the LKF.
This case concerns preparation for the European Basketball Championship for Men in Lithuania in 2011.
Balčiūnas was charged with abuse, fraud and other crimes.
Prosecutor's Office Balčiūnas blamed him for agreeing with the chief financier and executive director of the Federation in the position of Secretary General of LKF to write out, on behalf of the Federation, false acts of execution of works - transfer and other falsified financial documents included in the official accounts as well as bills of services provided to the Municipality of Panevėžys.
According to the pre-trial investigation carried out by officials of the Board of the Special Investigation Service (STT) Panevezys, the funds of Panevėžys City Municipality could be fraudulently and falsified for the benefit of the LKF and later used for reconstruction of the Via Unica hotel Romantic.
The head of this hotel Dalia Kuklierienė is accused of bribery - it is suspected that she gave a TV to M. Balčiūnas as a bribe.
All persons convicted with Mr Balčiūnas have been acquitted.
The charges in this case were brought against eight natural persons and one legal person - the Lithuanian Basketball Federation.
Remote workplace - like a Bermuda triangle
The number of people injured or killed at work in Lithuania from 1992 until now has already exceeded the total population of Alytus city and amounts to about 83 thousand.
If the requirements for a particular physical workplace and its security are as if clear, then the choice of remote working from home, public spaces or even other countries becomes a kind of new Bermuda triangle.
According to insurance specialists, although the Law on Safety and Health at Work provides for the provision of safety and health conditions which do not differ from other employees of the company, a variety of modern forms of work may raise a number of questions, according to the press release.
In the event of an accident at home, the employer pays compensation for the first two days of unemployment from 80%, and for the rest of the period - Sodra.
If it is found that the accident occurred during work, Sodra shall compensate 100% of the salary from the first day of incapacity for work.
When evaluating the statistics provided by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage administered by the BTA, it is clear that the absolute majority of accidents and various injuries at work occur at the workplace.
Most of these are physical works where the risk of injury is higher: devices or equipment are handled with care, concentration or coordination is lost.
However, the offices, which are now concentrated on most of the most inquisitive, best-paid professionals, are faced with their own challenges, which are created by employers and workers' particular love of mobility," says Jevgenija Krikščiūnė, Head of Human Resources Management Division of the BTA.
The legal acts in force in Lithuania recommend that the duties and limits of liability of the employee be clearly regulated, the working time, location and functions are defined, and this also applies to the formation of work remotely.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether the accident occurred during the work or not.
There are certainly different situations and nuances, and each case is dealt with individually.
Employees have often heard of the fact that, for example, when going to or from work or travelling to working meetings, the employer is responsible for accidents.
However, there are quite a number of nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both employees and employers to initiate interviews, to find out what situations are actually considered to be accidents at work and who will already have the status of domestic injuries, and to identify them with maximum clarity and acceptance on both sides," the specialist advises.
J. Krikščiūnė states that in these days, when the work functions are often fully performed by a computer and a mobile phone and a stable internet connection, the employee will not necessarily work at the place and time specified in the agreement.
Employees are mobile, they can choose to work not at home on that day, but by drinking coffee in a café or in a park, enjoying the sun.
Is that going to be a job or not?
What if the working hours discussed are not in line with the agreement?
There may be really mixed situations, the circumstances of which are explained by the investigation initiated by Sodra or the State Labour Inspectorate," says the specialist.
In financial terms, the main difference between an accident at work and an accident at home is the amount of the unemployment benefit.
Krikščiūnė admits that I had to hear unofficially unpleasant experiences when employers try to conceal the real circumstances of accidents or injuries and try to persuade employees to approach medical staff away from work, take responsibility for themselves, thereby penalising them financially.
This is an unfair, disrespectful attitude towards a worker and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of people already mentioned encourages the search for additional instruments that could help companies in similar situations: this includes employer's liability insurance for damage to workers, acquisition of injury insurance, disability insurance or even death insurance, as well as relevant health insurance," says J. Krikščiūnė.

Polish lessons for the Lithuanian rugby team
The Lithuanian rugby team, debuting in the European Trophy division, is still struggling to level up to a higher level of competitors.
Trophy division in the Old Continent is the third largest after the Six Nations tournament and the European Championship.
This is where the continent's 13-18-rated teams compete.
The event started in October with a solid victory in Šiauliai at 30:10 against the Czech team.
Last weekend the Lithuanian national team visited Łódź, where it did not match the Polish national team - 0:33 (0:12).
Although Lithuanians were self-sacrifice, they often violated the rules in their struggles, and Polish rugby broke out on the move with fine strokes.
The fine shocks of 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes were realised by Wojciech Piotrowicz, who gave 12 points to their members.
In the first quarter of 10 minutes Lithuanians had to play without the yellow card received by Tautvydas Mažylis.
In the second quarter, the guests organised several attacks, but they failed to complete them effectively.
At that time, the Poles were able to break through our defense.
Mateusz Plichta carried out the compression of the ball in the record area, then Krystian Pogorzelskis and Mateusz Adamskis.
In addition to several important rugby players, the coach of the Lithuanian national team from PAR Ntando Manyosha acknowledged the superiority of the rivals and said that such matches gave a lot of valuable experience.
"The Polish played very well and dominated all the components of the game.
Our goal was to stand up to this match as long as possible.
We have just risen to this higher level, and we need to get to know it.
We won the first game against the Czechs, but now we have met very powerful rivals and we have had to acknowledge their superiority.
The Polish national team has provided us with useful lessons," said a specialist from PAR, who has been standing next to the Lithuanian national team for four years.
Lithuanians will play the next game in Trophy division on April 6, 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanians.
Dutch and Swiss teams are still competing in this division.

The Japanese Coast Guard is looking intensively for missing islands
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given to a very small island in the north of Japan in 2014.
A small, meaningless and valueless island, which was fundamentally unliving, was very important to Japan.
It is so important that the area that has now disappeared is under intensive surveillance - will there be any more?
Why does Japan need this island so much?
It won't.
It is likely that ice and underwater landslides have taken the island forever, even though it has only recently climbed nearly two feet [2 m] above the water surface.
It is almost certain that the island has simply broken down, but at least its traces are expected to be found.
When the island disappeared, no one knew it exactly - it was so worthless that no one was too much for it.
Probably the first Japanese fishermen to learn about the disappearance of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima, who sometimes used the island as an aid to visual navigation.
Its disappearance, even for these fishermen, is not a tragedy, because there are better ways to catch where fishing is possible and where the disputed Russian waters begin.
That was the meaning of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima.
This narrow strip of earth was the western edge of the Kuril archipelago itself.
This chain of islands, which Russia calls the Kuril Islands, and Japan the Northern Territories.
The conflict with some of these breaks has been going on since the middle of the 19th century, but the full force has swelled in the 20th century.
These areas have natural resources, but Japan also historically believes that the islands should belong to it.
The fact is that the Japanese have been exploring these islands since the middle of the 17th century.
They were the first to make a map, to undertake more detailed studies, recording a large number of small islands.
The agreements signed between Japan and Russia in 1855 indicated that Sakhalin was the recipient of this agreement and that Japan was the owner of all the Kuril Islands.
In this way, these two states survived until 1905, when the Russian Empire defeated Japan in the war on Sachalin.
In 1945, the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened the Kuril Islands.
Japan, by the way, does not make a big claim to the entire archipelago, even though it was the first, but would like to have four islands - Iturup, Kunashi, the Sicotan Islands and Chabomay.
Japan feels that it has a historic right, because the islands were the first to explore, and Japan was also part of it under 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan invited Russia to share these four islands equally, but Russia did not even consider adopting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the northern territories, but now that the island has disappeared, this geographical link is as if lost.
That physical marker about the presence of Japan in those waters disappeared.
This is a huge loss, which is why the remains of the island are being searched for.
However, even if they are found in Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not correspond to the simple definition of the island - it must be on land.
This means a slight reduction in Japan's territory and a significant reduction in the Exclusive Economic Zone, calculated from the shores.
I'm just wondering what the island's search mission is hoping for - after all, it won't be lost or washed away.
Unbelievable drama in the duel of Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams
Over a week I had to wait for the final verdict of the judges who became the winners of the cross-border meeting between the Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian duels were held in Poland.
The four hits were won by Lithuanians, as well as by Poles.
And the decisive outcome of the duel was determined by the lengthy discussions of the judicial panel and the final decision of the competition secretariat.
The meeting started with the victory of Lithuanian boxers.
Multi-generational Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weight category up to 52 kg) confidently defeated Jakubas Surma, and soon Edgaras Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) defeated Radydra Obrušniakas after a persistent fight 2:1 .
Then he followed two victories of his masters: Damian Durkacz (up to 64 kg) at 3:0 defeated Manta Dužinas, and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) at 2:1 surpassed Simon Banny.
Vytautas Balsys returned to the Lithuanian national team (up to 75 kg).
Lithuanians 2:1 defeated Bartosz Golebiewski.
In another fight, Piotr Szczukowki (up to 81 kg) in the third round was clearly overtaken by Eygirda Kasmočių and the result was again equal to 3:3.
The brothers in Yocule were not successful in the same way.
Robert Jokulus (up to 91 kg) at 3:0 defeated Andrzei Colton, and Arvydas Jokulius (over 91 kg) had to recognize Adam Kulik’s superiority in the first round.
Tadas Tamašauskas' fight (up to 91 kg) and Michal Soczynski's struggle caused the most discussion.
It was because of its cross-border meeting that the announcement of the final result took more than a week.
One judge assigned victory to the Polish, two judges to the Lithuanian, but due to a technical error the point assigned to the Lithuanian judge was credited to Mr Soczynski.
After lengthy disputes, victory was left to the Polish boxer - 2:1.
At the Lithuanian-Polish national team meeting the victory was won by 10:8 (two points for victory) by the masters.
They managed to reclaim the Lithuanians for the crushing defeat suffered in the last mutual macho.
At the 2015 meeting in Marijampolė, Lithuanian boxers won as many as five of the six fights and won the victory with a result of 10:2.
The meeting for the leaders of the Lithuanian national team in Poland was a general rehearsal against the Lithuanian Boxing Championship in Šilutė on 14-17 November.
After the country's priorities, a new Lithuanian boxing team will be formed, which will defend the country's honour in the world and European championships to be held next year.
How does a dog trace the direction in which a man went?
You already know the dog's smell is very sensitive.
They can smell hidden explosives, drugs, blood, and other animals, and some even recognize diseases by smell.
Well-known and famous in movies trackers dogs, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.
How do they determine the direction in which the trace owner went?
In fact, this issue is much more complex than you think.
Tracking consists of three stages - finding, tracking and tracking.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, because it is difficult to determine which direction a man has taken.
After all, there's no second between the different steps, so their smell doesn't differ much, does it?
Not exactly like that.
A study published by the University of Oslo in 1990 described experiments in which a dog was led to a 90 - degree trajectory that passed through a person.
The tests are carried out on grass and on asphalt.
And in many cases the dogs easily determined the direction of the human movement, even when he tried to mislead them by passing backwards.
Can you imagine how difficult this task is?
The difference between the odour of adjacent traces is very small and decreases further with time.
But scientists say that it's not so strange - dogs could say which part of the foot touched the ground first.
This is because their sense of smell is an incredible tool.
The dog’s brain is dominated by areas responsible for smell (as do the regions responsible for vision in our brain).
Dog nose has 125-300 million odour receptors.
In general, the smell of dogs is at least 40 times more sensitive than that of humans, but their ability to interpret different odors plays an even greater role.
Scientists then carried out similar experiments with bicycle footprints, but it was much more difficult for dogs to trace their direction.
This is because the cancers of the bicycle are not segmented as the trace of the passing man, so it is more difficult to isolate different places for comparison - it is not natural for dogs, so it takes more time.
True, dogs are not the owners of the strongest smell.
This title would probably go to bear.
The white bear’s males have been tracking ready female mates for hundreds of miles, while the brown bear can smell the animal 30 miles [30 km].
In private forests promises to regulate fellings
Minister of Environment Kęstutis Navickas will discuss deforestation in the Seimas on Tuesday.
At the end of August, there was public dissatisfaction over the forests cut down in Labanoras Regional Park.
The felling of these forests was stopped for a month.
The Minister has acknowledged that investigations into cuttings in Labanore have shown that serious violations have not been committed.
However, the Ministry of Environment has already introduced a part of the restrictions, taking into account the task force's proposal to strengthen deforestation in state-owned forests.
The Minister promises that other legislation that will adjust deforestation will be prepared by the end of the year.
It is intended to apply the same restrictions to cuttings in state forests as to private forest holdings.
Agnė Jagelavičiūtė revealed the strategy of 170 thousand followers
We need to give people what they want and put what they want together, in the LRT TV show "Culturally with Nomeda" says Agnė Jagelavičiūtė.
According to the stylist, it gradually brought together a great crowd of fans.
"In the beginning, you flatter a person's taste, drag it to yourself, and over time you gradually improve that taste," says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has over 170 thousand followers in her Facebook account - she has achieved such a number using a certain strategy: "At first you flatter a man's taste, drag you to yourself, and over time you gradually improve that taste".
Stylist A. Jagelavičiūtė says she hates uncertainty, so she shows her face as it is - authenticity and the ability to find the best way of presentation are the most important criteria of popularity in social networks.
She notes that there is no human culture left on social media, because many Internet users come to them in order to get angry with someone or to read other people's comments: "For example, in adolescence, there was a time when I wanted to go to badter with everyone and curse - now I have no wish."
"False life is the worst thing.
And there's a lot of this on social networks.
Facebook is even less than instagrame," she says.
A. Jagelavičiūtė, who has an interior design and painting education, says that she sends a specific message on social networks - talks about emancipation of women.
It also promotes the production of magazines and sees creation in its work.
"I can't say that fashion magazine is an expression of pure art, but I know there's a lot of it there.
I believe that there is a lot of creation in my work, as well as vanity.
I'm balancing -- that's my key to those huge numbers.
I don't want to create a fake life.
It is far better to give people what they want and quietly insert what they want", says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the most difficult events to attract young people is classical music concerts.
To increase their popularity, known people have suggested through life stories: talk about backstages, failures, and life stories while remaining authentic.
It is this strategy that Jagelevičiūtė proposes to apply to the whole culture.
According to her, culture does not have the opportunity to disappoint anyone, to engage in entertainment, and to demonstrate true values.
"As a boring teacher against students - is there a chance?
If we do not find a way to present the art, advertise without advertising, it will not work.
When we're real and get a reader, maybe something's gonna change.
You'll catch one time, two, three, and already an addiction", - she shares her insights.
Three people disappeared after the helicopter fell in Lituya Bay north of June
On Saturday, after the helicopter crash north of June, three people were searched in Alaska.
One man was rescued after the disaster on Friday, and the other three could not be found.
The helicopter crashed near Lituya Bay, northwest of the June.
It was found that this was the case for Airbus H125 on a long-distance journey to Grand Preris in Texas.
Aircraft wrecks were detected on Friday at 100 feet from the coast.
According to Associated Press, one person saved was 14 years old.
A mild hypothermia was reported, but there were no other problems.
Two adults and two teenagers flew in the falling helicopter.
According to the CTVA, David King (53 C.E.), Josh Pepperd (42 C.E.) and Andrew Pepperd (11 C.E.) disappeared.
Senior Pepperdas was found to be the director of the Alaskan construction company Davis Constructors & Engineers.
It's not clear what caused the accident.
The National Transport Security Council has stated that an investigation has been initiated.
"The crashed helicopter, which was completely new – just from the factory, two adults and two teenagers flew," states a report by Coast Guard officers, according to the CCVA.
The pilot was found to have 40 years of experience in fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, including in Alaska.
According to Anchor Daily News, a family friend Jeff Brodsky said that relatives "have not lost hope of a miracle."
With the help of a coast guard helicopter, the rescuers resumed their search for experienced climbers missing on the Fort Vilja Hill in Scotland on 17 February 2016.
On Saturday, three people were searched in Alaska after the helicopter crash.
"I have experienced sexual violence"
The President's adviser, Kellyanne Conway, revealed the sexual violence suffered on Sunday morning.
Conway commented on the fierce dispute between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh, who is standing for the Supreme Court, and his accuser Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
Conway was excited to reveal that he himself had been subjected to sexual violence and defended Kavanaugh against his wife, Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge was charged with sexual abuse in disregard of facts that were unfavourable to the charges.
"I have great sympathy for the victims of sexual violence and violence.
I have been subjected to sexual abuse myself," Conway said on the CNN Sunday show State of the Union.
"I am a victim of sexual violence and I do not think that Judge Kavanagh, Take Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for it.
We must be responsible for our own conduct."
Conway said that the news network should be ashamed of the comparison of Kavanaugh with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced last week to three to ten years in Pennsylvania State Prison.
Conway also criticised the Senate Court Committee because it was unable to remove former President Bill Clinton, who had oral sex in his office and lied to the US people.
The survey showed that Kavanagh and Ford’s statements divided the US society
The Americans disagree on the testimony of Bretto Kavanagh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford – the accuser claims that she was sexually attacked by the judge when they were teenagers.
The number of people who think Ford or Kavanagh is lying is almost the same: 38 percent of those interviewed say that Kavanagh was probably or certainly lying in giving testimony, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Court Committee listened to both parties when Ford sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein with detailed charges against the judge.
After the letter was made public, both Ford and Kavanagh said they were ready to speak against the committee.
When giving evidence, Ford said that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanagh, not another person, tried to attack her at a party in the early 1980 ’ s.
In an emotional introductory speech, a 51-year-old woman said she felt a civil duty and could not remain silent.
"I am very scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think it's my civic duty to tell me what happened to me when Brett Kavanagh and I were in high school."
Ford and two other women, who denied the charges of sexual abuse, said that "no one had ever been sexually assaulted in high school, college or ever afterwards".
“Everybody tried to find something that would prevent me from voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic or disgusting it is,” he said.
"It's a simple last-minute defamation."
The results of the survey carried out by YouGov on 27-28 September, in which 2607 people were interviewed, are not surprising: the opinions of people who were sympathetic to different parties differed: democratic supporters believe more in Ford (73 percent) and Republicans believe in Kavanagh (74 percent), although ford's testimony was believed by more Republican people than by Kavanagh – Democrats (14 percent compared to 11 percent).
The founder of the “Body Worlds” exhibition, called “Doctor Death”, wants to be cut and displayed in his own exhibition
The German scientist who invented plasticisation wants to become an eternal part of his exhibition Body Worlds.
Gunther von Hagens has come up with an innovative method that allows us to demonstrate corpses, skulls and organs at an exhibition that has traveled the world, both admiration and controversial.
A 73-year-old man with fatal cancer ordered his wife to plasticize him after his death so that he would become a permanent exhibition at Body Worlds, which will be opened this week in London.
"In a sense, it will be the end of his life's work.
Now I understand that I will have to do this because I will express my recognition and love," Angelina Whalley said to The Observer.
She said that the man had given strict instructions on what to do with his corpse, and the entire process would take about a year.
Muscles, nerves and arteries must be wrapped and silicone injected into the body and placed in the right position.
"He said to me: "Angelina, you can freeze me to 25 degrees Celsius for a year, but then you'll have to add your hands, otherwise I'll freeze."
So I'll be able to mourn for a year, and then I'll have to do it."
He will then join the exhibition in the London pavilion near other bodies that stagnant in upright positions, such as riding horse or playing cards, by wearing a soft fetrine hat that is inseparable from his image.
Von Hagens became famous for his autopsy in the UK on live British television (which was the first public autopsy in 170 years).
Since 1995 more than 47 million people have visited Body Worlds exhibitions around the world.
Peter Tabernalis, founder of Body Worlds London, said that 100 percent of the exhibits of the exhibition, which covers about 28 000 square feet, were presented by people who "have given their consent because they wanted to help the living, educate them and help to see possible problems".
“We see and read so many terrible things that we fear death.
None of us will escape it, death is common to all of us, and I think that Body Worlds shows that there is no need to be afraid," said Tabernalis.
Ronald’s lawyers threaten a court action against rape charges
The lawyers of the Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronald said on Friday that the German magazine, which published the "manifestly illegal" American statements that Ronaldo had raped her in 2009, would be sued.
One of Ronald's lawyers, Christian Schertz, stated in his statement that the article in the magazine "Der Spiegel" was "an unacceptable statement of private accusations" and that he would seek legal redress for his client.
The application was sent to Reuters by Genaldo, a representative of Ronald, in response to the request to comment on the article published on the Internet on Friday.
Gestifute did not reply to specific questions about the content of the Der Spiegel statement, which Reuters could not independently verify.
Der Spiegel was first indicted in April 2017.
One of the most popular sportsmen in the world has won Ronaldo five times the world's best player.
This summer he moved to the Italian Juventus from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment on Der Spiegel's statement.
According to the magazine, the alleged rape took place in June 2009 in the hotel room of Las Vegas, as stated by Advocate Leslie Mark Stovallas of Kathryns Mayorga, who made the charges.
Stoval told the magazine that Ronald and Mayorga had agreed to an out-of-court settlement.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality agreement for $375 000 paid by Ronald.
The stavall did not immediately reply to Reuters' comments e-mails, and Mayorga did not respond to home phone calls.
However, Stavallas told Der Spiegel that he had filed a civil complaint with a view to annulling the confidentiality agreement.
Mayorga told Der Spiegel that she felt that the contract was not binding, because she still felt the consequences of the night nine years ago.
"I have survived serious crises," she said, "Der Spiegel".
"And also, a charge of rape.
I blame him and blame myself for signing it."
Sustainable business that ensures the independence of creators
Are you ready to try Self-Publishing 3.0?
For the first time, the new White Paper, published today by the Union of Independent Developers on the #selfpub3.0 website, explains in detail how to join other business creators, become independent and start a sustainable creative business.
The founder of the Union of Independent Creators Orna Ross, already recognised for the first time as one of the 100 most influential people in publishing, at the Digital Book World 2018 conference, will explain why developers should allow Self-Publishing 3.0 methods.
“Distances of consumption, such as the increasing popularity of personal brands, responsible consumption and reading on mobile phones, together with digital publishing technologies create a particularly favourable environment for creators' businesses,” says Ross.
However, these opportunities can only be exploited by independent and creative creators who understand the value of intellectual property.
#selfpub3.0 encourages developers to create several sources of earnings through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
Direct sales, subscription models, crowdfunding, wide dissemination models and other sources of income, such as online training and activities of the entity concerned, can be used.
#selfpub3.0 also encourages the distribution of books in a wide range of formats to the widest possible audience through retailers and other services.
The main goal of #selfpub3.0 is to encourage a change of mind and to learn how to manage your creative business, so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative asset, is not given recklessly to another company, such as a specialised publishing house or an independent publishing service.
According to Ross, this way creators can increase their income, influence and impact, and these methods must be taken into consideration not only by every creator of the digital age, but also by publishers; she also stressed that real independence of creators (as with other people) is guaranteed by commercial and creative freedom.
The future is here.
And its prospects for independent creators are now the best.
The book Self-Publishing 1.0 describes computer publishing and printing on demand.
Self-Publishing 2.0 is about selling books for e-book readers and phones in online book shops.
Now begins a new era of Self-Publishing 3.0, where independent publishers will be trained to start a viable and sustainable business.
The Union of Independent Creators is the only global non-profit organisation that unites independent writers publishing books.
The Union's objective is to develop the skills of independent publishers, promote ethical activities, help start-ups to sell books and encourage creators to carry out sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
The presidents of the country and the central bank warned the Italian Government of the planned deficit
The President of Italy and the head of the central bank warned on Saturday that the country's debt had to be kept under control, after hearing the populist government's plans to increase its deficit significantly next year.
The Governing Party (the opposition movement of the Five Stars and the Right North League) made a late Thursday evening offer for a deficit of 2019, with a deficit of 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and three times the objective of the previous administration.
This report has disturbed the market on Friday and encouraged the sale of bonds and hit the banks' shares.
Moreover, such plans are not consistent with the European Union, which applies EU fiscal rules and monitors their compliance.
Addressing the audience at the Presidential Palace, where the 70th anniversary of the Constitution was mentioned, President Sergio Mattarella mentioned that according to the country's framework laws, "the budget must be balanced and the debt must be kept under control".
"We will protect our citizens' savings in this way," he said.
At a conference in central Italy a little later, Ignazio Visco, President of the Bank of Italy, said that the country's debt, which is the largest of all the major economies of the European Union, could no longer be further increased, reaching 131 per cent of GDP.
"Italy must give priority to public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt," Viscos said, according to the state news agency Ansa.
"The debt must be gradually reduced."
The head of the Northern League and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvinis responded to Mattarella's words that the debt had increased as a result of strict requirements imposed by Brussels for years.
"Be calm, Mr. President," Salvinis said in his statement.
"The sovereign debt has gone out because of the budgets that have been imposed by Europe for years, and we are finally changing our plans and striving for a better future and growth."
Earlier, before Mattarella or Visco spoke, Commander of the Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio said that previously stolen money would be returned to the people" from the budget, but added that the government was not going to oppose the EU or the financial markets.
The ruling parties pressed Giovanni Trios, Minister of Economy, not affiliated with any group, to approve their planned deficit expenditure.
The Italian media stated that Mattarella supported Tria's failed attempt to maintain a budget deficit below 2 per cent of GDP.
The presidents of the country and the central bank have no direct influence on economic policy.
The 77-year-old president can reject the law and return it to Parliament, but only once.
Parliament can then adopt the unchanged law again and legitimise it.
Official information: Indonesian tsunami sensors have spent huge waves
The Indonesian geophysics agency withdrew the warning of the tsunami 34 minutes after its release, and then there was a severe earthquake that sent huge waves to the northeast coast of the island of Sulawesi, where hundreds of people died and thousands were homeless.
Car cullet after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018
During the 7.5 - magnitude earthquake and tsunami that hit some 1,500 km (940 miles) from Jakarta, at least 384 people died.
Officials said on Sunday that the number of victims was likely to increase.
On Friday, many people gathered to the festival on the beach of Palau, which was struck by many waves of six feet (18 feet) high when it was dark.
On Saturday, the Geophysics Agency BMKG received criticism on the social media: many people wondered whether the warning regarding the tsunami had been withdrawn too early.
The Agency stated that it had followed the standard procedure and decided to withdraw the alert on the basis of data from the nearest flood sensor around 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
“We do not have surveillance data from Palu.
Therefore, we had to make a decision based on the data we had," said Rahmat Triyon, the head of the BMKG Earthquakes and Tsunami Centre.
The nearest flood meter, measuring changes in sea level, only identified a “minor ” wave of six centimeters (2.5 inches) and did not notice the huge waves at Palu.
“If we had a flood gauge at Palu or received data from there, of course, the situation would be better.
We need to think about this in the future," Triyon said.
According to the officials, the tsunami hit Palu and the surrounding areas at high speeds of hundreds of kilometres per hour, but it is not clear whether it took place before the warning was lifted or later.
Residents check dead bodies on the street in search of their family members after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, September 29, 2018.
"On the basis of videos distributed on social media, we believe that the tsunami took place before the warning was officially withdrawn," said Triyon.
The most damaging 9.5-point earthquake occurred on the second Christmas day of 2004 and caused a huge tsunami that killed some 226 000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, including 126 000 victims in Indonesia.
The picturesque city of Palu, with a population of 380 000, is located at the narrow mouth of the bay in the northeast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (NPB), the tsunamis devastated the city in 1927 and 1968.
According to the University of Oxford geophysics researcher Baptiste Gombert, the earthquake should not have caused a tsunami.
The Friday earthquake was caused by a horizontal break – adjacent tectonic panels moved horizontally, not vertically, as usual for tsunamis.
"It is believed that there was a landslide at sea, which pushed out a lot of water and caused the tsunami," he said. He added that the power of waves moving towards the shore could concentrate in a narrow bay.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the representative of the disaster relief agency, told the correspondents that his team "was going to send easy-to-understand public warnings" when the warning about the tsunami was suddenly withdrawn.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, text messages with warnings were repeatedly sent to the residents, but Nugroho said that because of the earthquake the power and communication lines in the area were interrupted and there were no sirens along the shore.
The Indonesians in the social media doubted whether the BMKG had to withdraw the tsunami warning and were indignant that the information had not been provided in time.
"I am disappointed... The warning has been withdrawn... And the tsunami has still happened..." – a Twitter user @zanogucchy sent a direct message to the BMKG.
Golf: “Mollywood” duo intends to beat ticket sales records
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who won four games on Saturday, became the first two from Europe to win in all four pairs of games, and will probably be recorded in history, because representing Europe is already the leading result of 10:6 against the Ryder Cup finals.
Having defeated Tiger Woods and Bryan Dechambeau by a score of 5:4, they became the first European couple to win all four games.
Only the Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins managed to do this in 1979.
The devastating results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – do not show everything.
The couple three times defeated Woods, who had won 14 important titles, and twice won against Patrick Reed.
They also won victory over Jordan Siethe and Justin Thomas, a US team this week that won the next three matches.
Molinari and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five out of five.
Fleetwood has already scored the highest number of Ryder Cup units in competitions as a newcomer European.
The couple, which a large group of new fans called “Mollywood”, did not seem to be able to lead the European team forward at first sight.
Newcomers from the Ryder Cup, such as Fleetwood, are not expected to perform like this, and Molinari won none of the previous six games and landed in four rivals.
But there was hope: Fleetwood was the first in Europe last year, knows the Le Golf National Square as his five fingers and won the French Open tournament in 2017 and demonstrated a determined temperament during this year's U.S. Open.
Molinari is a new British Open champion and is considered by many to be the most consistent ball-player in the European tournament – a useful feature in a tight square where tall grass can lead to destruction, as demonstrated by American failures.
These players features and harmonious gameplay made them insurmountable.
"Now I feel a little emotional, and only Saturday," Fleetwood, who is famous for his relaxation, played all weekend with a wide smile on his face.
This afternoon, we performed well, played stable and well.
If we are together in history, this will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we've done our best for the team."
Molinari also rejoiced.
"It was great to play with Tommy," he said.
"But we have to fulfil our duty and not just get into record books, so tomorrow we will have to fight hard for the 4.5 point we need to win; it will not be easy."
Knight fever!
Ireland’s village turned into a medieval battlefield
In the west of Ireland, Claregalway Castle was previously the main fortress of an English knight-origin 15th-century family and this Saturday it was remembered of its origin.
Knight's duel with swords at the Medieval Battle Festival in Claregalway Castle in Galway, Ireland, September 29, 2018.
The fully restored English house with a tower was turned into a medieval battlefield, where many enthusiasts from all corners of the world recreated contact fights and games that were popular many centuries ago.
Karl Dornan, dressed as a knight, and Donna Dornan, wearing the Celtic Warrior costume, patrols the Great Hall of Claregalway Castle at the Medieval Battle Festival in Galway, Ireland, September 29, 2018.
"This is a great weekend trip and something unusual", said Denise Fitzgerald from Ker County, who has become the host of the tavern for the weekend, while cooking vegetables on the fire to the fighters.
“This brings us back to the simplest things.
I try to do everything as necessary", said the theatre worker, who for the first time participates in the armed fighting festival.
In the field, genuinely armored fighters competed, and even though their swords were dull, some had their helmets folded, and one had a lip injury.
Horsemen demonstrated their skills by riding and cutting cabbage and aubergines in half.
The metal castings beat weapons, spice merchants prepared drugs, and the craftsmen spun and dyed wool.
Seriously disposed and well - dressed participants tried to empathize with their roles.
“I think anyone can put on a suit, but the feeling for the role is art,” said Helene Stackpool, who played Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald and had a unique opportunity to use her fashion design knowledge.
“All suits are handmade.
I've been embroidered my belt for two years, and now I've made a dress, and I've made 800 pearls on her sleeves alone.
This is important to me," she said.
After the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of deaths rose to 832
According to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, the number of people killed on Sunday after the earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia has increased to 832, and the area affected is larger than initially thought.
Agency representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at the news conference that many people were trapped in debris after the 7.5-point earthquake that took place on Friday and caused six-meter (20-foot) waves of a tsunami.
FBI approached the second woman who accused candidate Kavanagh
The FBI agents investigating the case of a U.S. High Court candidate, Bretto Kavanagh, approached a second woman who accused him of sexual assault, which was revealed by her lawyer on Sunday.
According to the report of Mr John Clune, the lawyer of Deborah Ramirez, the investigation of the case of Kavanagh by the FBI will cover not only individual charges of rape brought this week by Dr Christine Blasey Ford, a Conservative judge of the Federal Court of Appeal, at a dramatic meeting of the Senate.
Ramirez accuses Kavanaugh of showing her his penis at a drunken party at Yale University dormitory when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave in to the pressure of the moderate Republicans of the Senate and ordered the FBI to carry out an investigation after the meeting of the Senate on Thursday, where Professor Ford of the University of California made extensive accusations that Kavanagh tried to rape her at a party in 1982 when both of them were in school and teenagers.
NBC News announced on Saturday that the White House had limited the scope of the FBI investigation.
The brief rebutted this and published a Twitter message: "I really want them to interview all the people they need at their own discretion."
Ray Shah, a representative of the White House, said that the Senate had established the scope and duration of the FBI investigation (the investigation must be completed within a week).
"The White House allows agents to do what they are taught," Shah said.
UK will not abandon environmental or animal protection standards after Brexito
Minister of the Environment Michael Gove said on Sunday that the United Kingdom will not abandon environmental or animal protection standards so that after Brexito it can enter into commercial transactions.
British Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove arrives at Downingo Street, London, 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conference of the Conservative Party, Gove said that it is in the interests of the United Kingdom to be known for its quality food products and that the government will publish a strategy on food this year.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in unit competitions
Francesco Molinari deserved the credit for returning the Reeder Cup to Europe on Sunday: the Italian defeated Phil Mickelson at the 16th hole and earned a point that helped to achieve the required 14.5 result.
Mickelson surrendered to the pit, putting the first ball in the water, and Molinari, who was able to survive on the roll-out site, became the first European to win all five games a week, even though none of the previous six won.
The victory of Europe has already been assured that the Italians had a blow from the launch site and that the victory of the continent was short of one point, while Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia were at least half-way ahead in the macho and secured at least half of the point.
At the beginning of the day they were led by the result of 10:6 and had to earn four and a half points out of the possible 12 to recover the trophies and establish their dominion at home, which has continued since 1993.
Prior to this, the team managed to eliminate the difference of four points and win the unit matches only twice: the US team did so in 1999 in Brooklyn and Europe in the 2012 Wood Miracle Competition, but no one expected another dramatic return.
Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson and Tony Finau gave the Jim Furyk team hope of winning the first matches, but then the points of the European team filled the whole course.
Thorbjorn Olesen smashed Jordan Siethe, and his teammate, new John Rahm – Tiger Woods, lost four times out of four.
Ian Pooler, recognized as the best player in the Ryder Cup, probably received the most ovation this week when the world's best player, Dustin Johnson, landed on his 18th roll and brought Europe closer to victory.
Then we had to wait for the match to end first, and it was Molinari's game that caused a wave of joy in the crowd, which was the largest in the history of the event.
RT World News: German policemen protecting Erdogan used the neonacio name as code word
According to the local media, secret officials in eastern Germany, who were protecting the Turkish President Erdogan during his visit to Berlin this week, used the name of the infamous neo-Nazi extremist.
The Ministry of the Interior of the Region stated that the criminal police of the Land of Saxony in eastern Germany were investigating two members of the elite anti-terrorist unit SEC.
The men were meant to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on his long-awaited journey to Germany.
Officials had to work secretly, so according to the protocol they had to use the code name.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, the infamous neo-Nazi, who belonged to the National Socialist Underground (NSU) extremist group, which killed eight immigrants from Turkey at the beginning of this century, one Greek citizen and a German police officer.
The local media report that a strange code name was discovered when two policemen requested permission to access the internal documents needed to accomplish the task.
The officers in charge immediately withdrew the police.
Peter Klein, Commander of the Saxon Criminal Police, was the first to respond to the news.
He said that the decision to use Boehnhardt's name was "probably the most foolish" and thus "the victims and their loved ones are clearly ignored".
Mr Roland Woller, Minister for the Interior of Saxony, supported this statement and called the decision "fearful, terrible and totally unacceptable".
Erdogan's Friday's visit to Berlin led to a number of contradictory assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticised for accepting a leader accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel stated that this visit was very important "because in the event of disagreements, they have to be dealt with in person at a meeting".
The public first heard of the NSU in 2011, when bodies of Boehnhardt and his accomplice Uwe Mundlos were found in a trailer house that burned in eastern Germany.
It is believed that one of them killed the other and then committed suicide after a failed attempt to rob the bank in Eisenah.
Soon a third member of the neo-Nazi group, the last surviving member of Beate Zschaepe, was also arrested.
In July this year, a German court sentenced her to life imprisonment for 10 murder charges.
She denied her involvement in the murders, but her lawyer said that the accused felt guilty because she did not try to stop the murders.
After the NSU scandal, the German security agencies received a lot of criticism.
Lawyers, activists and relatives of the victims believe that the group had much more accomplices.
It also turned out that the German internal intelligence agency BfV infiltrated many informants into the NSU and constantly interfered with investigation of group-related murders, attempts to kill and robbery.
Muskas withdraws from the position of Head of Tesla and will have to pay a fine of $20 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elonas Muskas has agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, who sued him for Twitter fraud, where he claimed to make Tesla a private company.
Muskas will have to withdraw from the position of Head of Mission, but will remain Director General.
The documents of the agreement stipulate that Muskas must leave the office of Chairman of Tesla's Board of Directors within 45 days and will be prohibited from returning to that position for three years.
In addition, he will have to pay $20 million in fine.
It all started with a Twitter message that was recklessly or deliberately written misleadingly, so Muskas will have to obtain prior confirmation before saying or announcing anything about Tesla "in any format, including, but not limited to, social media records (e.g. Twitter), the company's website (e.g. company's blog), press releases and calls to investors".
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because it did not check Musko's initial Twitter message.
In a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Muskas is accused of misleading investors by a Twitter message on 7 August, where he said he had found funds to make Tesla a private company worth $420 per share, making the company's securities more expensive than 10%.
Muskas soon withdrew his words, claiming that Tesla would remain public, and angered investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission decided that Musko's initial statement "was wrong and misleading because it did not rely on facts".
Muskas himself explained in his blog that this mistake could be justified: after a meeting with a representative of the Saudi Independent Property Fund, he had the impression that he was able to reach an agreement on the funds.
Muskas and the Securities and Exchange Commission were reported to have come closer to a more lenient punishment – Muskas would have had to renounce the position of the Chairman for only two years and should not be found guilty, but Muskas refused this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday, Tesla's stock price fell, probably as a result of which he changed his opinion again and accepted stricter conditions.
However, according to the new agreement, as according to the old one, Musko does not have to confess his guilt for misleading investors.
Alexandrian patriarch committed himself to supporting the canonical Ukrainian church and urged orthodoxians to unite
Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria stated on the basis of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which belongs to the Patriarchate of Moscow.
He responded to the separation of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
On Thursday, Theodore II arrived in the city of Odessa in the south of Ukraine and met with the highest representatives of the church and the faithful orthodox.
The Alexandrian patriarch is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchs, descending only to the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople.
"I came to tell you: do not abandon the Orthodox faith and canonical church," Patriarch Theodore II said in his address.
Before his visit to Odessa he met with the Polish Orthodox Church Metropolitan Savva, who also supports the canonical Ukrainian church.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts resulting from attempts to legitimise the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
"We will always support those who seek orthodox unity," said Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church recently experienced a major crisis following the decision of the Patriarchate of Constantinople to recognise the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinople decided to send the exarches to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting one Orthodox church from interfering in another’s affairs.
Exarchs are special representatives of the Patriarch, formally higher than Metropolitan Onufriy, who is the current head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate.
Moscow’s Patriarchate reacted to the actions of Constantinople and withdrew all general church services and memberships in organizations led or co-chaired by representatives of Constantinople.
However, it is claimed that this decision warned Constantinople not to take other hostile action and that both churches were not considered to have completely broken their ties.
Of the three churches located in Ukraine, the other churches recognize only one – the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Patriarchate of Moscow.
Most Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the secessionary churches, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kiev, which was born in the 1990s.
This religious movement even has a patriarchal leader, Philaret, who seeks official recognition of the Orthodox Church, full independence and equality with the Patriarchate of Moscow.
Damascus first opened the Syrian-Jordan main trade transition in three years
According to the state news agency SANA, the Syrian government has announced that it will open a border crossing on the Nazis border with Jordan, which has been closed for three years as a result of hostilities in the area.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side have abandoned the land near the city of Daraa.
Nasib is the most important trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between Lebanon and the Gulf.
Key messages from Lavrov's UN speech
While visiting the UN Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov attacked the West for "political blackmail and brutal force" and said that diplomacy must not give in to dictatorships and unilateral sanctions.
The Minister said at the UN General Assembly on Friday that some Western countries are putting pressure on others in an effort to maintain "the positions of the world's own world leaders" without remorse.
He did not name specific countries, but said that they were using "political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world has to pay a high price for the selfish ambitions of a small group of countries.
Lavrov, who has represented Russia at the UN for a decade, said at the meeting that the culture of diplomacy and negotiation is being replaced by dictatorships and unilateral sanctions imposed without the approval of the UN.
The Minister stated that the sanctions imposed on many countries are "unlawful or ineffective" and recalled the blockade imposed on Cuba by the US for many years.
"But history has not taught us anything," said Lavrov and added that "Western proponents tend to impose blame only if it is "very likely".
We remember how often such unfounded accusations justified interference and wars, such as the bombings of Yugoslavia in 1999, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the interference in Libyan affairs in 2011."
Of course, Lavrov did not mention all Western invasions and reminded of the seven - year war of Syria as one of the most recent cases.
The failed attempt by extremists to overthrow the Damascus regime could have been disastrous for the whole country and open the way for the establishment of a 'terrorist calliphate'.
Lavrov commended the Astana peace process, which was launched jointly by Russia, Turkey and Iran, and claimed that this process had helped to prevent the Islamic State (IS, previously known as ISIS) and other groups wishing to hijack Syria as a whole.
The most important thing now is to rebuild the war-ravaged areas of the country and help refugees to return to their homes safely.
Lavrov returned to the battle of great forces and said that the UN was actually founded "after learning from the Second World War".
The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs recalled that in 2018 it was 80 years since the 1938 "glorious" Munich Treaty, where France and Great Britain agreed to allow the Nazis to annex the German-populated part of Czechoslovakia in order to reassure Hitler.
Although then Britain's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said that the Munich Treaty "will bring peace to these times," war began a year later.
"Munich's betrayal" shows how far "the egoism of countries and disregard for international law" can lead, – said Lavrov.
"The dictatorship and violence of the colonial era must be placed in a historical archive or trash bin."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the problems of the world, said Lavrov.
"If you have questions or objections, sit down and talk, reveal the facts, listen to your colleague's arguments and try to reconcile the interests."

RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are surrounded by mist, and Bibi's finger points to Iran
The Israeli Prime Minister stated in a speech by the UN General Assembly that Tehran has secret nuclear weapons.
It is possible that Israel, who accuses others, is hiding something on its own.
The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who loves the presentation, revealed news on Thursday – he showed pictures of the sites where Iran allegedly holds nuclear material.
Tehran quickly replied that Tel Aviv would rather take care of his “undeclared nuclear weapons programme. ”
Although Israel never recognized (but never denied) nuclear weapons, RT journalist Murad Gazgovas tried to find out whether Tel Aviv should actually look for a log in his own eye.
Scottish Government: No complaints against Alex Salmond before January
According to the Scottish Government, no complaints have been lodged against Alex Salmond by January of this year.
The former First Minister was charged with two charges of sexual harassment in January, even though he strongly denied them.
He was informed of the investigation in March.
Salmond, who has resigned from the Scottish National Party, will sue the Scottish Government for an anti-Hungarian complaint process.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first dealt with in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been lodged by January.
A representative of the Scottish government said: “The Scottish government received two complaints in January against Alex Salmond.
We could have ignored them or concealed them.
Previously, the then Deputy First Minister did not receive any complaints about Alex Salmond and, as we have already said, the first Minister heard about the investigation from Alex Salmond for the first time in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legitimacy of our processes and will insist on our position.
The Scottish Government will endeavour to obtain as much information as possible within the time available.
However, as we have already mentioned, we cannot comment on Mr Salmond's case for legal reasons at the moment.'
Alex Salmond’s spokesman said: “We will not comment on anything, for our petition against a permanent secretary is now being heard at a court hearing and we hope that a decision will be made soon.
We'll talk in court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's complaint procedure against Alex is illegal."
Glasgow smashed Dragons with a score of 29:13: Lee Jones' spurt by Warriors
Glasgow regained the title of winners in Guinness Pro14 by winning extra points and winning Dragons at Scottoun Stadium, and coach Dave Rennie does not hide satisfaction, but believes that the game could have been more accurate.
After an unexpected defeat for the South Kings team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie asked the team to make an effort and even though she was able to collect the necessary points to remain at the top of the A conference, the windy and rainy weather matches were not really smooth.
"I think we defended well tonight, played on the right side of the square and our strategy was good," Rennie said.
“We need to play more accurately and have been able to exploit more opportunities.
The conditions were unfavorable.
We have created many opportunities, and we welcome that.
It is necessary to play more accurately, but 40 or 50 points earned today would not have been a good result.
We had to do our best.
We won extra points, but next week we have to do more while playing at home with Zebre and next week – with Saracens in Europe."
Although the weather was windy, Glasgow's team early started earning points, but IOM caught all Huwo Jones' lost balls, including his caught Niko Matawalu internal transfer in the left corner.
Disappointment took a long time: the left pillar, Ol Kebble, broke out in the middle for the fourth minute, and Adam Hastings easily caught the throw.
Dragons reduced the difference when Arwel Robson got a fine and the guard took another player right after the 20-minute mark and the velves won the point.
The match after a rather calm first half has come to an almost half-hour mark: Glasgow attackers consistently attacked the Dragons line, and then the South African judge Stuart Berry punished the Welws for 22 minutes on the side of Hastings.
Warriors went into a fight, but lost the ball after a smooth transmission, because the left edge of Matawalu could not control the ball and it was passed to the left.
The second test was performed two minutes after the interval: Hastings broke the Dragons line and cleverly handed the ball over to the running Lee Jones.
The ball was returned to Hastings’ position, and the score reached 12:6.
Glasgow had a very successful first minute in the second half: Lee Jones captured the defeated Alex Dunbar ball for the second attempt, and Hastings helped him.
However, Warriors did not give up after failure – just four minutes later they took over the ball in the middle of the square and the Dragons Centre Adam Warren took it under the gates, earning points, and later Josh Lewis took over after an open game with Robson.
Warriors quickly returned to the leading position and at 54 minutes after the fourth attempt, he scored extra points when Huwa Jones moved to the right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (which was the third failure of the four attempts).
Glasgow maintained a comfortable higher position and performed a fifth test a few minutes later – Dunbar handed over the ball after the fight with George Horne and Hastings scored.
Kebble was declared the best match player, but Rennie praised Hastings.
"They obviously hindered us from playing, but we opened up at the middle," said the coach.
“It was a few meters short, but it was slippery, and he still managed to drift away.
He's in good shape and he's self-confident."
Ayr United defeated Morton with a 1:5 result: five-star Ayr defeated the host team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore won two goals, and Declan McDaid added another one to help Ayr stay at the top of the championship table.
Ayr went forward after Shankland's goal, which was struck from six yards after Michael Rose's corner strike to McDaid.
At 35 minutes, Morton evened the result of his first attempt when Charlie Telfer took the ball from the hesitant Robbie Crawford on his own court and sent him through Ayr gatekeeper Ross Doohan to the far edge.
Players from Grinoko had a chance to get ahead at the fourth minute of the second quarter, when Doohan crashed Gary Oliver, but Michael Tidser released a weak fine that the goalkeeper easily caught.
Ayr passed over the rivals for the second time at 74 minutes when the long-range transmission of the substitute Craigo McGuffie was hit in the air and fell down to the ground by another substitute Craigo Moore.
Moore gave the ball that minute to Shankland, who scored 17 for the season.
As the fans rallied, Moore returned to his side the fourth from the edge of the court, and McDaid sent the rebound to the gate.
Alloa and Falkirk ended with a 0:2: first victory for young people in the league
"I am happy, I feel a relief, I am happy," said Ray McKinnon after the much-needed first victory in the Falkirk league and the earned points of the season.
The forwarder Zack Rudden (18 years) borrowed by Rangers earned a goal in both rounds and pushed the host team Alloa Athletic to the bottom of the championship and freed the club from stressful problems.
"It was an important game for us," said McKinnon.
“We probably deserved more in the last three matches, so it was great to score three points in a stressful situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It wouldn't have caused anything, but it was important for us to win."
Rudden sent the ball to Patrick Brough at 26 minutes and scored the goal from the gate line in the middle of the second quarter, when Deimantas Petravičius slowly kicked the ball over the gatekeeper Neil Parry.
"We wanted to defend ourselves firmly, but failed," said Jim Goodwin, the head of "Wasps".
The petition of Hearts fans for semi-finals received more than 11 000 signatures
More than 11 000 people signed a petition for the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup for fans of Hearts.
The sires are angry with the decision to hold both semifinals on the same day and at the same stadium.
Advised by the Scottish police, SPFL decided last week to organize Aberdeen – Rangers playoffs at 12:00, while Hearts – Celtic decided at 19:45 to provoke the rage of both Jamba and Dons fans.
The Evening News together with Aberdeen Evening Express asked the fans for a fair decision on Saturday.
The decision of the so-called "Super Saturday" was condemned by both "Aberdeen" and "Hearts": both clubs issued statements in which they criticise the timetable.
On Thursday, a petition was published on the exchange.org website, requiring one of the matches to be moved to another place or date.
A man accused of stabbing two women in Kent's village
Two women who were in the 60 ’ s and 80 ’ s died in the crime scene.
According to the police representative, another man, who also exceeded the age of 70, was hospitalized and is in a stable state.

The police have not yet identified the victims, but they think they knew the suspect.
Neighbors said that they were shocked by an event in the village which they claimed to be "silent and friendly".
In 31 years Sophie Moorey-Brown said Press Association: "We live here for five years and have never heard of any bad incidents – it is always very quiet and pleasant to live here."
Royal Archives and the creators of the musical Hamilton will light the world about King George III
When the Queen presented the project, during which a huge archive of documents accumulated during the reign of George III was opened, it was hoped that letters, diaries and languages would help the public to get to know the king who was considered mad.
Now these documents will reach a different audience – the Royal Archives decided to cooperate with the Vestend musical.
The academics who wanted to reveal the true face of the king invited Jurgius III acting in the musical Hamilton to review the most important documents from the reign of Queen Proproprosenel in the Windsor Palace Library.
Researchers try to make old manuscripts accessible to a wider audience, so a large crowd of fans of the performance will be able to access digital documents.
Royal family members have already publicly supported the creation of the musical, and the Duke and the Duchess will watch the performance twice, even though Prince Harry's ancestor is constantly shown on stage.
Michael Jibson, who plays as a king in Vestend, said that the documents made me think and helped me to know the image of the king, whose audience was formed by the musical Hamilton, the film "The Madness of King George" and the series "The Horrible Stories".
"We fell in love after beautiful letters"
U.S. President Donald Trump did not name enthusiasm after trying to reduce tension with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un and said at his sponsor's meeting on Saturday that after correspondence they were in love.
Mr Trump and Mr Kim stated that they would seek nuclear disarmament in the Korean Peninsula, as they discussed at an unprecedented meeting in Singapore this year.
Before moving to a new stage in history after many years of public controversy, the leaders of the countries exchanged threats and insults because North Korea wanted to create a nuclear missile that could reach the US.
“I was as strict as he was.
We always used to say words," Mr. Trump said at the meeting in West Virginia.
“And then we fell in love, you know?
In fact, he wrote me beautiful, great letters."
Lekavičius and Panathinaikos entered the semifinal of the Greek cup

Atenna team on the trip made 76:68 (29:24, 17:15, 15:11, 15:18) it overcame the Patras Prometheus team.
The Lithuanians spent 14 minutes in the square, gained 4 paths (2/2 two tons), played one ball and performed one successful transmission and twice failed.
Nick Calathes was the most successful player in Panathinaika, which earned 15 points.
Scrub Crossing Shimonyte: everything was decided by the "cream" party.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis says that there was a lack of democracy in the internal elections of the Conservatives, and the party leadership actually appointed Ingrid Shimonytė as a presidential candidate.
"The celebration of 'democracy' itself was nevertheless strange, to say the least, when the party cream, the top decided and actively supported one candidate.
Probably there was no chance for the second candidate to win even theoreticals," said S. Skvernelis to journalists in the Government.
"The Conservatives have appointed their candidate, and we congratulate them," the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister delegated to the "State Greens" said that I. Šimonytė should be appreciated by the voters, remembering her work in the Government of Andrius Kubilius.
S. Skvernelis has not yet commented on whether he will be present in the presidential election.
The Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union intends to approve its candidate next year.
Ramūnas Karbauskas, the leader of the ruling peasants, described the conservative elections as a 'failure to experiment' due to the lack of party activity.
"First of all, we must welcome an experiment that has absolutely failed.
Only 55% of the members of the party participated, in total only about 20 thousand voters.
Knowing what money had to be spent on organising those elections, it is quite clear that it did not work," said R. Karbauskasis to the news portal delfi.lt.
"I think that the cost will not justify the result, because the result is nothing, the party has decided that their candidate is - it's all right, but for whom to spend so much money," he added.
During the internal elections on the weekend, 79% of Conservatives and their supporters voted in favour of Mr Šimonytė's candidature.
Lithuanian salaries make Estonians laugh: one area can change everything
According to this year's survey of Baltic States, the Baltic Salary Survey, which organizes remuneration tests, wages increased mainly in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia have remained close to their neighbours, according to the company's press release.
"Having surveyed 850 companies and examined the changes in remuneration in the Baltic States, we can see that the monthly pre-tax wage grew by 81.8 per cent of employees in Lithuania this year and increased by 7.7 per cent on average, while the annual wage with supplements increased by 10.5 per cent.
Latvia slightly overtaken us - there was a slightly higher annual remuneration, but as in Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our country," says Povilas Blusius, the representative of the remuneration research company, and adds that having such wage growth trends, the country's general economic indicators should also be taken into account, which dictate them.
In Estonia wages grew fastest
Although salaries in Latvia and Estonia rose to a lower proportion of employees than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, annual wages grew by 71% of the surveyed companies' employees, reaching slightly more than 11 percent in our country.
In Estonia, remuneration increased by 73% of employees this year and increased by 13 percent on average.
Trends in wage growth are also strongly influenced by staff turnover, as job changers can receive a much higher salary than in the previous job.
For those who did not change their jobs in Lithuania in recent years, the annual remuneration increased by 8.8% - more often than in other Baltic countries.
In neighbouring Latvia, correspondingly, the annual wage growth for such workers was only 3.6 per cent.
Estonia remains the leader in the Baltic States not only as the average wage raising rate for new workers, but also for long-term workers.
For those who did not change their jobs or duties, the pay here was the fastest: monthly - 6%, annual - including bonuses - as much as 9%.
According to the remuneration research specialist, such trends often depend on, or go hand-in-hand with, the general economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, the monetary policies of the state, prevailing market moods.
For example, forecasts of the coming economic downturn encourage businesses to be more cautious and invest less.
Dominant and fastest growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction, and pharmaceuticals, can also increase general statistics and mask minor changes.
The biggest tax burden for Latvians
When comparing remuneration increases, it is important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees pay the highest share of taxes depending on their salary, as much as 31 or 34%, which may increase to 42.4 percent for those earning more.
This is the case in Lithuania with a stable rate of 24 per cent, so with higher salary growth in Latvia, employees may experience the same or even lower tangible increase than in Lithuania.
The tax rate applied in Estonia is similar to that applied in Lithuania – 23.6 per cent, so in this country we find the most favourable taxation of labour in the Baltic States.
IT - most competitive salaries
According to the research, the position of IT specialists remains among the best paid in all Baltic States, almost irrespective of the level of the position.
The opposite situation in retail is one of the lowest market indices in this area, so employees earn less than the average market income.
Compared to the previous year, wages have been growing fastest for engineering professionals with higher positions, as well as for risk management professionals.
This increase in remuneration did not overtake some IT positions this year - a significant proportion of organisations' information security specialists increased their monthly salaries by as much as 14 percent.
In contrast, retail wages remained relatively stable.
However, some companies have successfully restructured their remuneration systems, where the annual wage for bonuses increased by about 2 percent.
According to the remuneration specialists, there is a tendency that wage growth dictates the demand for the most inquisitive specialists - the demand for system analysts continues to grow in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande suffers again: a former fiancé keeps making fun of her
After the divorce with Ariana Grande, the crushed Pete Davidson pours his pain out to make jokes about their relationship.
In Saturday Night Live, he chose to joke about how fast he was attacking serious relationships.
The fans say it's true, because just three weeks ago, Ariana and Pete canceled their engagement, which took place in just a few months to get to know each other.
Pete tried to create scenarios that mentioned his bad relationships, but it'll be a little later on the screens.
There are rumors that a humorist who ridicules his former relationship is irritating Arian himself.
Such jokes hurt her, and they don't hurt her heart.
At least that's how the secret sources told TMZ to the foreign news portal.
White or brown: Dietologist recommends which sugars to choose
White or brown?
Which sugars to choose from?
During the poll in supermarkets it became clear that although Lithuanians still traditionally prefer white sugar, it is surprising that many nationalities refuse this ingredient, which was referred to as white death.
The fact that brown sugar sales are growing is also true of supermarkets.
According to Maxima's representative, brown sugar is becoming more and more popular and nationalists are buying more and more of it, although traditional, white sugar is still ahead of choice.
The sales of organic sugar are also growing in specialised organic products stores.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to nutritionist Dalina Vaitkevičiūtė, the main difference is price, and both can have a harmful effect on health.
"The red unrefined sugar is three times more expensive, but from a health point of view, these sugars, if multiplied, are harmful to the body when consuming excess sugar," said D. Vaitkevičiūtė.
A nutritionist recommends that the amount of sugar be reduced gradually in the daily routine.
By doing so - the benefits in every way - the unwanted kilos will fall, and health will also improve.
In a month of consistent sugar use less, it will be easier to discard it at all.
"Every habit we form in about a month's time, so after doing such an experiment, let's say, a month's time to drink some sugar-free product, coffee or tea, we will see how it works and I think everyone can give up a little effort," the idetologist gave us advice on how to give up sugar.
Doctors say that sugar has been referred to as white death for good reason: abuse of sweets can be the cause of obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases.
It is therefore worth trying to reduce its consumption, especially since it is added to many foods, even in bread.
Another step of Lietkabelis: Lipkevičius lends to the next LKL team
Panevėžys Lietkabelis team said goodbye to Vytenis Lipkevičius - the forwarder is lent to Prienai "Skycop" team.
During this "Betsafe-LKL" season, V.Lipkevičius would throw 6.4 points in 22 minutes, regain 2.8 ball, perform 2 outputs and collect 8.5 efficiency points.
In FIBA Champions League 29 year-old 198 cm tall athlete statistics reached 3.8 points, 2.5 rebounds, 1.5 beats and 4.8 efficiency in 21 minutes of the game.
In the near future, Lietkabelis will announce a new purchase, which will strengthen the composition.
S. Buškevicas joined the coaching staff
Sandis Buškevicas, who was well-known to Lithuanians, became an assistant of Panevėžys "Lietkabelis" team's chief coach Nenadas Chanakas.
The 41-year-old Latvian played in Vilnius Lietuvos rytas in the 2005-2006 season, and in 2014-2017 he worked as an assistant coach in the club's system.
Last season S. Buškevicas trained Jėkabpils team "Jekabpils".
Sports director Jonas Vainauskas invited Steponas Babraauskas to the staff, but he is still going to continue his basketball career.
Vytenis Jasikevičius also received an invitation, but both sides failed to reach an agreement.
Š.Buškevicas will work together with Robertas Kuncaitis and Algimantas Bružas at the Lietkabelis Coach Headquarters.
Latvia will join Lietkabelis on Tuesday and will be on Cido Arena via FIBA Champions League match with Dijon JDA, but we will not see it on the bench yet, as registration ended 24 hours before the start of the match.
Reducing the price of biofuels will not appeal to everyone
In 2019 more deciduous trees will be cut in Lithuania in order to reduce biofuel prices, says the Minister of Environment.
According to Kęstutis Navickas, this is the way to "impact" biofuel prices.
"We have large accumulations of certain types.
We need to unbalance (...).
There is a concentration of soft deciduous trees, because this way we can also have some impact on biofuel prices," said K. Navickas in the Seimas on Tuesday, presenting the situation regarding deforestation.
According to K. Navickas, this year the price of wood in Lithuania increased by about 20 per cent.
According to the Minister, next year the number of pines will be cut down as much as this year, and the number of spruce - about 80 hectares.
According to him, more wood was harvested in Lithuania due to favorable natural conditions.
"It shouldn't be next year," said K. Navickas.
Currently, 10.2 million ha of forests are state forests and 800 000 ha are private.
Tackling food prices - a dubious obligation: will promote buying only in your area
Among the measures presented by the Ministry of Economy, an obligation to purchase 50 per cent of food products from local producers is proposed, news portal 15min.lt is published.
"The law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions, but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, local companies that have won tenders could also supply printing services or office supplies to the buyer in municipalities," Minister of Economy Virginijus Sinkevičius said to the portal.
Egidijus Mockevičius, the president of the meat processors association, is convinced that this provision would discriminate against a part of businessmen, and it would be difficult to monitor whether the law is being used by sellers.
The measure is also criticised by Valdas Sutkus, Head of the Business Confederation, for its inconsistency.
Macron calls on Europe to defend itself against Russia and the US
French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday called for the creation of a 'real European army' with the potential to protect itself from Russia and even the United States.
Mr Macron, who has been calling for the creation of a common European force since his entry into power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
He has recently come up with a strong argument when US President Donald Trump announced that Washington would withdraw from the important Cold War Treaty on nuclear forces.
"We have to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States," Mr Macron said to Europe 1.
This is the first interview he gave to the radio since the beginning of his work in the post of President in May 2017.
"When I see President Trump announcing that he is retiring from the important disarmament treaty that was created after the rocket crisis in Europe in the 1980s, who will be the main victim? - Europe and its security," said the French leader.
The aforementioned rocket crisis was caused by a race for the development of non-strategic nuclear weapons at the end of the Cold War, during which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was the main factor that led the US and the Soviet Union to conclude the Medium Range Nuclear Force Treaty (INF) in 1987.
'We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a genuine European army,' said Mr Macron in an interview recorded on Monday evening in Verdene, north-east France, while the President was visiting the battles of the First World War this week before the 100th anniversary of the end of this conflict.
According to Mr Macron, in a situation where 'Russia, which is at our borders, has shown itself to be a potential threat... we need a Europe that defends itself better, not simply dependent on the United States'.
The French leader has become the main initiator of the project, which has led to the creation of forces from nine European countries capable of rapidly organising a joint military operation, evacuations from the war zone or assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
The Defence Ministers of these nine countries will meet in Paris for the first time on Wednesday to discuss the details of how these forces will operate.
The European Union has also set itself the objective of significantly increasing its defence budget from 2021 onwards and of allocating around €13 billion over seven years to research and development of new technologies.
The current EU defence budget is under €600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomara of the French Military School, which holds senior officers, said that Mr Macron's vision of a closely unified defence of Europe was difficult to implement.
"The idea of building a culture of common strategy is not bad," he said to AFP news agency.
- But there is a huge gap between the European defence that Emmanuel Macron is dreaming of and the reality of the great differences between the European partners."
Lukashenko threatened NATO with missiles: we are not idiots
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated on Tuesday that his country would need a new weapon if NATO continued to join forces on the western border of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to intimidate, deploying bases in Poland or anything else, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, especially missiles," the state news agency Belta, which met with American analysts in Minsk, quotes Lukashenko.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its own missile manufacturing industry.
"Last year - you have noticed, and we are not hiding - we have built our missile industry and produced our very precise (applied) missile weapons," the President underlined.
Last week Lukashenko stated that Minsk and Moscow were looking for an appropriate and inexpensive response to the plan to build a base in Poland and to name it in honor of US President Donald Trump's "Fort Trump".
"Of course, we are concerned about this.
If, for example, they declare in Poland that they are prepared to spend millions of dollars in order to be deployed there (...), some short fort, of course, we are not idiots and, of course, we are reacting to this," said Lukashenko, during the main group discussions at the Munich Security Conference in Minsk.
"It is understandable that we are discussing with our main ally (Russia) how to respond to all of this and how to find an appropriate response at a minimum cost," he added.
Western relations with Moscow were seriously undermined by Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Their links are also being undermined by Moscow's role in the conflict in Syria and this year's March in Great Britain, which is believed to have been an attempt by Russian special services to poison former double agent Sergei Skrypal's nerve paralysing material.
The tension between Moscow and Washington intensified in October when Mr Trump announced that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that this step could destroy the world's security system.
A man who executed a violent execution revealed the murder of a footballer who raped his wife
Brazil was rocked by a horrific crime that led to the brutal execution of Daniel Correa Freitas, a footballer in this country.
A sportsman was murdered during the 18-year-old girl's birthday party.
A 24-year-old footballer was found dead in Paran, southeast Brazil.
He is declared to have been executed, including a cut of genitals, and severe neck injuries are reported.
When 38-year-old Edison Brittes Junior killed a footballer, he admitted his guilt and claimed that he had done so because D.C. Freeitas raped his wife Cristian Brittes.
Later, after a terrible murder, the Brazilians told me in detail on the television about what had happened on the fateful night.
"The child had already gained momentum when I realized that I had not seen my wife Cristiana for a long time.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
And when I had not waited, I broke the door, and saw Daniel lying naked in the bed, and my wife, who begged for help.
I was mad to death.
With my friends at the party, we dragged him outside and put him in the car.
Here I had a knife with which I stabbed my wife's man who raped him to death.
I was very angry, I couldn't do anything to myself at that moment," the murderer said.
Together with his friends, he threw the dead body of a footballer near the river, where police officers are also looking for the main tool of a dreadful crime.
The civilian Brazilian police arrested E.B.Junior as well as his wife and daughter who celebrated her birthday.
It is said that police officers investigating the incident still lack evidence that the woman was raped during the party.
It is true that the latest footballer's messages and photos on WahtsApp, which have recently been distributed, can help the research to progress.
The footballer sent one of his friends through WhatsApp two pictures in which he captured himself in bed, next to a sleeping woman who later turned out to be the killer's wife Cristiana.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in different rooms in the house.
I'm going to eat my anniversary mom, even though her father is somewhere nearby," the footballer wrote to his friend.
Daniel Correa Freitas, a member of Sao Paulo Club, was lent this season to Sao Bento, the second-ranking player in the Brazilian league.

Alabama Hurts can no longer use suspension
The Alabama backup gamer, Jalen Hurts, will not be able to be suspended for this season after this Saturday.
Hurts is included in the top-rated Crimson Tide Saturday match against the weaker Louisiana team and this is the fifth player's match this season.
The new rule was applied by the TVB this year – the player who participated in the four matches can be suspended.
This month, Athletic announced that Hurts planned to do this because of the controversial assessments of the player and the team staff responding to them.
Tua Tagovailoa replaced Hurts at the beginning of the season, but Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said he was planning to use Hurts' skills anyway.
Last season Hurts helped Alabama get to the match for the National Champion's title against Georgia's team, but in the second half he was replaced by Tagovailoa, who contributed to Crimson Tide's victory with a result of 26:23.
Hurts, a former attacker of the South East Conference, started the last 28 Alabama matches and entered the season with a record 26:2.
During the first four episodes of Crimson Tide on Saturday, Hurts completed 22 out of 31 transmissions, ran 276 yards, scored four times and took over the ball once.
He also ran 15 times with the ball and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Desas must sign the contract immediately
Dez Bryant, a former Dallas Cowboys attacker, said he was about to return to the NFL.
Terrell Owens, a member of the museum of glory, said that it would be better for Bryanto not to delay.
In response to the Twitter question when he intended to sign a contract with the team, Bryan announced a one-word Twitter message on Friday: "Soon."
Bryan, selected three times to the Pro Bowl matches, is not part of any team since Dallas Cowboys refused it in the middle of April in case of a wage dispute.
Bryan, who may have given up his contract with Baltimore Ravens and is constantly associated with Cleveland Browns, said just before the season that he wanted to improve his contract with the team.
Owens, who entered the museum of professional American football fame in August, still talking about returning to the NFL, said to the site TMZ that Bryan should try to return to sport as soon as possible.
"He must join the team and prove to everyone what he can," said Owens to the website.
“All surveyors think that he is out of luck and he is no longer as good as he thinks.
Now he must get into the team for any salary, accept one or two years' contract – it doesn't matter at all – and show everyone what he is capable of."
In 2017, Bryan Dalas caught the ball 69 times, ran 838 yards and scored six times.
The 29-year-old player did not run 100 yards for the longest time in his career – 23 matches.
By signing a $70 million five-year contract in 2015, Bryan did not run 1,000 yards in any season and did not catch more than eight scored balls.
“If the CEO or owner thinks that your skills are deteriorating, you will not be able to guarantee or accumulate the amount you want,” Owens advised.
He also warned that Bryan should get to the team as soon as possible, because this might not happen at all later and said that it would be possible to return to the Cowboys, who were going through difficult times.
"Of course. I don't know if their relationship is damaged," said Owens, who has scored 38 times for three seasons playing in Dallas's team.
"I think that, in the case of Dezo, if Cowboys take it back and he gets the chance, it will be good for Des and franchise."
Arranged on the establishment of CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania
Representatives of the European Nuclear Research Organisation (CERN, European Organisation for Nuclear Research) who visited Kaunas last week appreciate the possibilities to establish a CERN business development centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe that provide businesses with support in commercialising CERN technologies, developing innovative products and adapting them to the needs of society.
Although Lithuania became a member of CERN only last year, the establishment of this organisation's business incubator was suspended in the country already then.
CERN representatives in Kaunas visited Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and Institutes of Materials Science and Biomedical Engineering of Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) in Santaka Valley.
At the meeting, guests at the National Innovation and Business Centre (NIVC) together with representatives of KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuanian Energy Institute, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Economy and business discussed Kaunas innovation ecosystem and opportunities for young and innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important because if CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a significant impact on the region's science and business innovators.
"Such an incubator would encourage the adaptation of CERN's accumulated knowledge and technologies to solve important problems, such as new technologies and artificial intelligence would be used for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and for the processing of large data," says Dr. Leonas Balaševičius, KTU Vice-Rector for Science and Innovation.
CERN incubators, like other young business development centres, provide support for business development by providing information and expert advice on technology adaptation in product development and helping to find sources of funding.
The difference is that the CERN incubator is more science.
Such a centre in Lithuania would involve experts from various fields: IT, material engineering, as well as medical specialists.
The organisation CERN is best known for the Swiss Large Hadron Collider, the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world.
However, CERN studies are carried out not only in quantum mechanics, but also in other areas, from cryogenics (very cold temperatures for materials) to particle monitoring and radiation studies.
These technologies and scientific works have an impact on many areas of public interest: medicine, safety and industrial development.
Vilnius Vodka has a new manager
The beverage manufacturer AB Vilniaus Vodtinė appointed Rokas Mituzas as the new CEO, who will replace Raimondas Pilkė in this position.
Since the summer of last year, Mr. Pilke, who led the company, will continue to perform his duties as finance director of Vilnius Vodka, according to a report distributed through Nasdaq on the Vilnius Stock Exchange.
Mr. Mituzas is the co-founder of Buga LT, a company that produces sauces, as indicated in his LinkedIn account.
In 2012-2017, Mr. Mituzas served as regional director in SPI Group and previously worked in Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever groups.
Vilnius Vodka completed the first quarter of this year with a loss of EUR 315,500.
Last year, the company earned a profit of EUR 392,300 during the relevant period.
The company's sales revenue excluding excise duty amounted to EUR 4.956 million and decreased by 13.16% compared to the first quarter of last year.
The Vilnius Vodka employs more than 100 people.
STT has detained R. Ača - Verslo žinios
Former parliamentarian and former director of Raseiniai district municipality administration Remigijus Ačas is suspected of bribery.
He's been detained.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) reports that officials of Šiauliai Board are conducting a pre-trial investigation of possible corruption in Raseiniai District Municipality.
"The former director of Raseiniai district municipal administration R. A. (Remigijus Ačas - rev.) is suspected of bribery.
The circumstances under investigation due to the non-transparent public procurement, R. A. in the position of municipal director - a possible exceptional favor for one private company to conclude a public procurement contract with an enterprise managed by Raseiniai district municipality.
It is suspected that R.A. has accepted a bribe of high value (more than 250 MSLs) for this," says the STT press release.
BNS adds that this company is the "Raseiniai Bus Park".
On Monday, the officials also detained Vladislovas Šimaitis, the suspected leader of the company "Raseiniai Bus Park", managed by Raseiniai Municipality.
This was confirmed by Ms Renata Endruzytė, spokesperson of the STT.
According to the STT report, the allegations were also made against two representatives of companies who directly bribed Mr. Ača or were involved in masking bribes in various financial transactions.
All suspects are detained and searched in their workplaces and at home.
Member of the LSDD
Remigijus Ačas was the director of the administration of Raseiniai District Municipality for some time, but in April he lost his position if the council did not approve his report.
He was also the mayor of this district in 2011-2012.Mr Ačas is a long-time member of the Seimas and has been elected to parliament since 2004, as a candidate for the party "Sustainability and Justice".
However, in 2013 his and this party's paths differed, and in the 2016 Seimas elections he failed to achieve his mandate independently.
Now, Mr. Ačas is dependent on the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDD) led by Gediminas Kirkilas.
Not long after this news came out, President Kirkilas of the LSD announced in a press release that Mr. Ačas temporarily suspended his party membership while the investigation was ongoing.
"The actions and suspicions of the Special Investigation Service Remigijus Ačas are an unpleasant surprise to us, but in all cases, law enforcement must take all necessary steps to find out the truth.
R. Ačas suspended his party membership while the pre-trial investigation was ongoing," says Kirkilas, the leader of the LSD.
In 2003, Mr. Ace was the head of an advisory team on national security matters to the then President Roland Paxo, who was subsequently removed from office through impeachment.
Mayor Gricius: I did not directly control the works of R. Ačas
Neither Algirdas Gricius, the mayor of Raseiniai district, nor the current head of municipal administration Liudas Kavaliauskas said on Monday that the BNS had no information about which particular procurement could be related to the law enforcement investigation.
Mayor Gricius said that he had learned from the media about Mr. Aceh's detention.
"I really can't say we were very dissociated by the functions, I did my job as a mayor, he (R. Ačas - BNS) - the work of the administration, and I couldn't say either for what reasons or for what public procurement this case was made," the mayor said on Monday.
It also claimed that for the same reasons it did not wish to assess the former leadership of Mr Ačo’s municipal administration.
I'd be afraid to say something that I could appreciate his activities because I didn't directly control his administration's work, how much he presented to me for public procurement, for competitions, for such public procurements, for such competitions, then what was visible in the public space, for contracts, I'd already see as a mayor.
Therefore, I cannot tell you how he was in charge of the administration at the time as its director," said Mr Gricius.
He said that he did not intervene in and influence public procurement.
New advisor to the Lithuanian Minister of Culture
Assoc. prof. dr. Josephas Blažiūnas supplemented the team of advisors of the Minister of Culture Liana Ruokytė-Jonsson.
He will advise on the issues of archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage management.
The Ministry of Culture reports that Mr. Blažiūnas, who has acquired a PhD in Art Science at the Vilnius Academy of Arts since 2016, has been the director of the Lithuanian Literature and Art Archive, as well as associate professor at the Department of Museology of the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University.
By the way, in 2017 the students of the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University elected Mr. Blažiūnas as the best lecturer of the Faculty.
The new minister is the author of many scientific articles on cultural heritage and preservation of valuables.
The Change Continues
The VŽ recalls that in May of this year the team of the Minister of Culture Ruokytė-Jonsson was left by the advisor dr. Viktoras Bachmetjevas, who advised the Minister on media communication policy issues, and was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renaldas Augustinavičius announced his resignation from the position of Vice-Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums and libraries.
Then Mr Ruokytė-Jonsson said that her new new Vice Minister would be setting up the same areas as Mr Augustinavičius.
In addition to Mr. Augustinavičius, the team of ministerial advisers is currently composed of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidijus Gailiunas, Rusnė Rinkevičius and Eglė Saudargaitė, the chief adviser.
S. Gentvilas: due to the failure to operate GPAIS business is threatened with fines of EUR 90 million
Simonas Gentvilas, Vice-Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, says that due to the poor functioning of the product, packaging and waste accounting information system (EPPAIS), Lithuanian producers and importers may have to pay fines of almost EUR 90 million at the end of the year.
"As the end of the year approaches and the GPAIS system has not started to function normally, the systemic crisis in the packaging management sector is becoming a more realistic scenario.
It is unofficially stated that certificates confirming the management of packaging waste have been issued only 1% of the estimated recycling tasks," says Mr Gentvilas in his press release.
On 7 November the Seimas shall initiate an extraordinary meeting of the Environment Protection Committee, where it is intended to discuss the situation, to find out why the functions of this programme are not functioning, why the module of the programme is not actually implemented and how the Ministry of Environment intends to solve the problem.
'In the absence of the necessary legislative or legislative initiatives, producers and importers risk again receiving huge environmental pollution taxes at the end of this year,' says Mr Gentvilas.
In his opinion, the deficiencies and inaction of the GPAI accounting system signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the "Metrail" crisis.
Anxiety About Tasks
Some experts warn that some companies may not be able to reach the targets set by the State for packaging waste recycling in 2018.
After seeing the first half of the year the recycling rates of packaging made public by the organisations, the experts say that they see a reason to worry that some organisations may not manage the required amount of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, a part of the companies might no longer benefit from the emission tax exemption and would receive a pollution tax for a certain amount of packaging that they have placed on the market during the year.
Two out of the three producer organisations currently operating, VŽ wrote, reject such concerns, and one does not comment.
Kęstutis Pocius, CEO of the largest public enterprise Green Point, said that at least formally the success of the tasks depends on whether the problems of the Product, Packaging and Waste Information Accounting System (GAIS) will be solved.
The Green Dot plans that this year all types of packaging management tasks, except glass, will be overcome.
Although the Green Point glass task cannot be overcome this year, the organisation promises to compensate members for the losses that will result.
Experts Doubt the Benefits of Food Coupons
When the government plans to distribute food vouchers to the less well-off and thus promote family or farmers' trade business, experts question the benefits of such an innovation.
They agree that a new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Marius Dubnikovas, Head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Business Confederation, says that vouchers are obsolete and will not solve the problem, and the Government should concentrate on increasing people's income.
"The system looks rather strange and it's like it's taken from older textbooks.
If we want to help the public to acquire something or to have greater purchasing power, we need to focus all our capacities on how to increase people's income, and people have to decide whether to buy in one store or another," Mr Dubnikov said.
According to him, by offering food vouchers, the government would pay attention to people on lower incomes.
"Clearly, it applies to people on lower incomes, like a vaucher placed on a tray, on which it would be written, we, this government, have given you a vaucher, and be in favour of us.
It sounds like some pre-election promises, where you want to add your signature very clearly to them," the analyst said.
According to him, the food vouchers system will require additional investment and will increase the administrative burden by monitoring who allows them and how they are protected against counterfeiting.
Nerijus Mačiulis, the Chief economist of Swedbank, says that with one instrument to achieve both objectives - to support low-income citizens and small entrepreneurs - would not succeed.
"In the case of support for small entrepreneurs, the vaucher aid compensates for price differences and allows residents to buy more expensive goods in smaller shops, the price difference is compensated by the State from the budget.
Then it's business support, but not support for residents," Mr. Mačiulis said in BNS.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macro-economic impact and would not fundamentally change the competitive position of small shops, but rather create an additional bureaucratic burden and could make it difficult for new entrants to come.
"It seems that this would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and it would also be rather uncomfortable for the population, they should shop not in some larger store with a larger range closer to home, but look for several specialized stores with a smaller range", said the economist.
According to him, vouchers are used in other countries when there is a limited volume of goods or services and they need to be provided to everyone in the same way, or to some social group.
The residents then receive coupons free of charge and can spend them on food.
According to Mr Mačiulis, they are also used in the labour market to provide temporary tax relief for companies, to employ the long-term unemployed or, for example, to former prisoners.
Such practice, in the words of Mr. Mačiulis, was successfully applied in Lithuania as well.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said on Monday that the government's proposed new food voucher system would help the poorest people, increase competition and encourage small traders or farmers to do business.
Prime Minister Skirmantas Malinauskas said on Monday BNS that the idea is mostly focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could get a 20-30 percent discount.
According to him, the number of vouchers would be limited to prevent abuse by farmers.
According to him, 3-5 vouchers would allow a person to benefit from 10-15 euros per month.
According to him, although the state budget does not yet provide for funding for the programme, it could be financed from this source, perhaps also from European Union funds.
"Not everything currently provided for or not provided for in the budget will be in the final, yet it will change in the Seimas, so it happens, there may be funds transferred from one line to another, and from ministries, there may be changes in funding subjects.
There is always a priority question as to what would be the decision - whether to refuse something, find another additional source of income and so on," said Mr. Malinauskas on Tuesday.
The extent to which and from when innovation can be applied is currently being decided.
