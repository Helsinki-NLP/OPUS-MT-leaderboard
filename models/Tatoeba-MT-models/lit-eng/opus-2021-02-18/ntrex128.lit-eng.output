Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that "looking like dolls"
Some members of the Assembly were obsessed with the proposal to change their name to MWP (English: a member of the Parliament of Wales).
This concerns the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule at a political level.
One member of the "Labour" Assembly said that his group was concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
Not for readers of Wales: In Welsh "twp" means "fool" and "pwp" means "what".
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the whole group was "unsatisfied" and proposed alternatives.
The Conservative of Wales said that his group was "open" because of the name change, but noted that it was the shortening of the word from MWP to the "doll".
For the word w is pronounced in the same way as the word u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legal acts to change the title, said: "The final decision on the names of all members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the Members themselves."
In 2017, a law of the Government of Wales gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals that received strong support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
As regards the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission gave preference to members of Parliament in Wales or WMP, but MWP received the highest level of support during the public consultation.
The Assembly clearly offers alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement may be a headache for the presidency, Elyn Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on amendments in a few weeks' time.
The legislation on reforms will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of a member of the Assembly and the committee framework plan.
During the legislative debate, members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on the question of what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
On Sunday voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A general vote was held to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents claims on Greek territory and repeatedly contradicted Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
In opposition to the plebiscite, the President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zaran Zaev, say that changing the name is simply a price that simply has to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin and other churches silenced during Harlem’s difficulties
“The old people with whom I spoke said that historically on every corner a bar and a church could be found,” Adams said.
- You won't find one or the other today.
He said it was understandable why the bars disappeared.
“Today people communicate differently,” he said.
- Bars are no longer a neighborhood site where people gather constantly."
Speaking of the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not be enough for the long term, as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by flats with cooperative apartments, which would be inhabited by people who would not help the temples that remained nearby.
"The majority of people who buy cooperative apartments in these multi-apartment buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will hurry up the moment when the churches shut down completely, because most of these people who moved to these cooperative apartments are unlikely to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built in 1870 by white congregations, before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolis community, and the church of St. Martin was built a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation was set up in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation, which held services nearby, took over the name of the building.
The church of St. Martynas was taken over by the Black Congregation with priest John Howard Johnson, who led the retailer boycott on 125th street, the main store of Harlem, which refused to recruit or assign blacks to senior positions.
In 1939 the building was badly devastated by fire, but since the parishioners of the spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
The clergyman David Johnson, the son and successor of the spiritual father Johnson in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the carillon the bell of the poor.
The experts who entered the carillon in July called it "the treasure of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the world’s first carillon to be played by black musician Dionis A. Lindas. 18 years ago he started playing a bigger carillon in Riverside church.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him with another musician.
What happened in the last few months in St. Martin's Church was a complicated story about architects and contractors – some were invited by the laymen of the church, others by the Episcopal Church Diocese.
Zacrisja, a parish governing body made up of secular leaders, expressed in July the diocese's concern that the diocese "will try to pass over" the sacristy, although it did not hire architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
A shark in California injured a 13-year-old catching lobster
Officials reported that the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he caught lobsters in California on the day of opening the lobster catch season.
He was attacked at 7:00 a.m. in Ensinitas near the Lighthouse Beach.
Chad Hammel San Diego told the KSWB-TV show that he was diving with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy crying for help, and then came with a band to help him get out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was worried when he caught the lobster, but then he realized that the boy cried out: “I was bitten!
I'm bitten!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that all his collarbone was torn.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: "The shark is flying in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was taken by plane to the children's hospital of "Rady" in San Diego, where he was recognized as in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
Swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks ago there was a shark in the area, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper torso.
Officials closed the beach from Casablad Pont to Ensinit Swami for 48 hours on investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the zone, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to push into the UK beauty market
"Sainsbury's" is taken over by "Boots", "Superbrug" and "Debenhams" with department of beauty in the style of department stores, where specialists will work.
Proactively pushing into the UK GBP 2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow, while the sales of fashion and household goods are falling, the larger beauty department will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if they succeed, more stores will be installed next year.
Investments in beauty are growing, and supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves that are once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
“Sainsbury's” announced that it would double its beauty range up to 3,000 product names, including signs such as “Revlon”, “Essie”, “Tweezerman” and for the first time “Dr. PawPaw”.
The existing range of "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more space in trademark zones similar to those in shops such as "Boots".
The shopping centre also releases its Boutique make-up range again, most of which are vegan – this is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test discounts in two Sainsbury's stores, from which the first one opened last week in Croidon, South London, and the second one will open later this year in Seli Oak, Birmingham.
Because of online shopping and the willingness to buy small quantities every day from local stores of essential goods, supermarkets need to do more to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, said that the company's ex-shops increasingly look like department stores, because supermarket chains are trying to deal with selling goods cheaper by offering more services and non-food goods at Aldi and Lidl stores.
"Sainsbury's" included Argos stores in hundreds of shops and also installed a number of "Habitat" stores, since two years ago they bought both networks, which allegedly strengthened the sale of food products and made their purchase more profitable.
Previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade its beauty and pharmacy department ended in failure.
In the early 1990s, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended in a dispute about how to distribute income from supermarket stores.
A new strategy emerged three years ago when Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network to Celesio for £125 million.
It was argued that Lloyds' contribution to this plan added an expanded range of luxury leather care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
"Sainsbury's Commercial Director Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We have changed the beauty department's exterior and atmosphere to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and because of the attractive environment and comfortable places we are now an attractive place of beauty, challenging the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "furious" because Holly Willoughby terminated the GBP 11 million deal with him
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones was "exasperated" after Holly Willoughby, the host of the TV show, terminated the deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Mr Willoughby no longer has time for their household and accessories for the ‘Truly’ brand.
The pair's business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old head of "This Morning" program, "Instagram" account, announced leaving.
Holly Willoughby left a lucrative lifestyle brand at the last moment in order to focus on his new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, angered the Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say that Jones was "furious" when, at a tense meeting on Tuesday, a golden TV girl admitted at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow (Bakingamshire) that she would not be able to spend enough time on his household goods and accessories trade mark "Truly" due to new deals of up to £1.5 million.
The business was compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop, and it was assumed that it had to double the assets of H. Willoughby by GBP 11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby announced in his Instagram account that he left it to Tuly, Jones flew from Great Britain to one of his summer homes.
Source said: "Truly" has been one of Holly's top priorities so far.
This should have been its long-term future, which will last for the next two decades.
Her decision to leave was extremely surprising to everyone.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
There is a full warehouse of goods ready for sale at Marlowu's headquarters."
Experts believe that the exit of The Morning host, which is one of Britain's most successful stars financially, may cost the company millions of dollars due to large investments in products, from cushions and candles to clothing and household items, as well as delays in starting things.
And this can be the end of a long friendship.
For a decade, the mother of three children, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been in close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
In 2016, Willoughby and T. Cappu founded the "Truly" and in 52-year-old P. Jones joined him as chairman.
Couples are on vacation together, and P. Jones holds 40% of the shares of Baldwin TV production company.
H. Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin, the head of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
A close source of Jones said yesterday: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
We had a tough conversation and "that's when we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he received from the media about the comment made, which some might consider to be 'non-president', and about the fact that he is so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump refuse so much?
The short, mocked voice of the "newsman" said:
"I didn't refuse anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in June in Singapore had been supported as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's highest-ranking diplomat Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea is not receiving a "appropriate response" from the US regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
He noted that instead, the US continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his brief speech, he expressed a much more optimistic view.
“We are doing great with North Korea,” he said.
- We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We are now maintaining this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: it was the end of rocket tests, help to free hostages and return the remains of American soldiers to the house.
He defended his unusual attitude by talking about relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10 000 people who want to get into this stuffed arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd standing right in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing hundreds of people
Following the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lomboko were deployed, this was not declared a national disaster as a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been made very clear that there is no need for international aid, so it is a bit complicated," said Sumbung.
Although "Save the Children" prepares a team that will go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether employees working abroad will be able to work locally.
Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
In view of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters from the tsunami were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu, despite the announcement of the tsunami, is likely to lead to an increase in lost lives.
The best time to travel between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims sails to Palu, but it will reach the new disaster site in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo chose the reconstruction of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure as his election campaign centre, and he generously spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding was troubling the Yoko administration, as it will be re-elected in the coming years.
Yoko is also under pressure from the persistence of sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopt a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1 000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows with arrows and other simple weapons.

The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami is already 832
As reported early Sunday by the country’s disaster agency, the number of deaths in Indonesia rose from an earthquake and a tsunami to 832.
The agency’s spokesperson at the Sutopo Purwo Nugroh press conference reported that many people had been trapped in the ruins of buildings that had been destroyed as a result of the 7.5 - magnitude earthquake on Friday, which caused waves of 6 meters.
Palo, with more than 380 000 people living in the city, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.

The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a native of Berkenhead and she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still ongoing, as the police have reported that the victim's closest relatives are being informed.
Grayson Muse's taxi driver just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police said no one could enter and leave the building.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell is struck by the last blow of the 'rewriting of history' dispute.
Its removal would be poetic justice for the destruction of England’s cultural and religious heritage, reminiscent of Taliban activities, under the responsibility of the fanaticist Puritan followers of Cromwell.
However, the Cromwell Society described the Cricket's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the transfer of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s statue at the Westminster Palace was inevitably to become a target.
Cromwell did not order or execute the iconoclasm of English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft is a reflection of the 19th century attitude and a part of the historiography of a figure that many still have time to honor.
Goldsmith The Sunday Telegraph said: "Many people, perhaps more than today at the end of the 19th century, Cromwell was considered a defender of parliament against external pressure, which was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether this is accurately portrayed, historians still argue.
One thing is clear: the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed a later development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this divide.
His achievements as the Lord's defender are also worthy of mention and honour."
A pig killer to death killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in southwestern China’s market.
On Sunday, Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found. Because of the damaged artery, he was bled with blood and was lying next to the piggy in the Lupanias market in Guidjou Province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer in Siningo, China, was preparing to administer vaccines to pigs.
He announced that on Wednesday, along with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junan, he was going to go to the market to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found a relative dead and found a door to a nearby piggy.
He said there was a big boar in the pig, whose mouth was stained with blood.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that a pig weighing 250 pounds [250 kg] killed a farmer.
"Guiyang Evening News" quotes: "My cousin's feet were bloody and wounded," said the cousin, after giving his name Wu, .
The video from the security camera showed Yuan, entering the market at 4.40 a.m., to feed her pigs on Thursday.
His body was found in about an hour.
Yuan or his cousin was not part of a man - killed animal.
The manager of the market reported to Evening News that the pig had to be locked to stop attacking other people and kept until the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reported to negotiate compensation for death.
Although few pigs have been reported in the past, attacks against humans have been reported.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and the husband was particularly seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 2,95 pounds [295 kg] pressed the Welsh farmer to the tractor and pressed the animal until his wife chased the animal.
After the pigs were eaten by the Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer, CBC News, told us that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the aggressive taste of blood can be stimulated.
“They are just playful.
They love biting, very curious... not inclined to harm anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
The remnants of the hurricane Rosa will bring great rain to the southwest of the USA
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken, moving through the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring plenty of rain to the entire north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday from 5 a.m. Rosa moved at 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km southwest of the Euchenian Cape (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, on the Pacific side begins to form a stretch of low pressure areas and moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to carry great tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause rain in some areas of Mexico to reach an inch [25 cm].
Then, tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching low - pressure area, will bring a large, abundant rain to the southwest in the coming days.
Instead, rains of between two and three inches [2.5 cm] and six inches [10 cm] will cause a dangerous flood, a flood of debris, and possible landslides in the desert.
Because of the high tropical humidity in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, rainfall will fall between five and eight inches [8 cm] per hour.
Rain is expected in the south-west regions, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Because of the fragmented nature of tropical rain, there may be a sudden flood and rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In the face of a tropical storm, a particularly bad idea would be to walk into the desert.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms can cause waves of wind and dust.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
More than an inch [1 cm] of precipitation is likely to cause a small stream of debris, and roads can become slippery.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Some tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, and later the rain will spread late on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain after Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah will spread on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations can occur in all of the United States as the Arctic cools, but in the tropical zone it will be quite warm.
Sometimes this results in huge temperature changes over small distances.
Sunday was an excellent example of huge temperature differences in the central US.
Kansas City (Mishur) and Omaha (Nebraska) temperatures are almost 20 degrees different from those of Saint Louis and Di Moino (Iowa).
In the next few days, the summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
It is expected that in the vast central and eastern part of the U.S., from the Great South Plains to the northeast, a warm October will arrive with a prevailing temperature of 27 degrees Fahrenheit in many places.
The temperature in New York City should rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the temperature in the eastern US will be higher in the first half of October than the average multiannual temperature.
Over 20 million people watched Bretto Kavanagh's trial
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday's six television broadcasts the voices of the High Court candidate Bretto Kavanagh and the accusations of the woman Christine Blasey Ford of sexual violence in the 1980s.
However, the political impasse continued after the broadcasters interrupted their regular programmes due to the change of Friday's last minute: the senator of Arizona had agreed that the FBI would carry out a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford was told to the Senate Court Committee that it was absolutely certain that when Kavanagh overheard her at the high school party, he grabbed her and tried to wear her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in an angry witness, said that he was absolutely certain that this was not the case.
Nielsen announced on Friday that perhaps more than 20.4 million people were watching the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers who were viewing broadcasts via CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has certain difficulties in calculating the number of people watching television in the offices.
To be more understandable, it's the same size of the audience as it would be at the playoffs or the Oscar awards.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the first of all networks when the audience reached an average of 5.69 million during the full-day hearing.
ABC, with 3,26 million spectators, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that it received 3,1 million CBS, 2,94 million NBC, 2,89 million MSNBC and 2,52 million CNN spectators.
A great interest continued after the hearing.
The main figure of Friday's drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanagh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning when protestors shouted at him while he was trying to take the elevator to the hearing of the Court Committee.
CNN directly filmed it with downside eyes when people floated it.
“I stand here in front of you,” said one woman.
- Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told: “You have power when so many women are helpless. ”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the lift was closed, added that he had more to say at the hearing of the Court Committee.
Later, cable TV and broadcasting networks discussed directly when the Court Committee voted in favour of Kavanaugh’s nomination for the Senate.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would investigate in the coming week the allegations made against the candidate, which were called for by the Democratic minority.
After talking to his friend, the Democrat Senator Chris Coons, Flake was partially convinced.
After talking with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
The Flake's choice was valid because it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to confirm Kavanagh without carrying out the investigation.
President Trump has launched an inquiry into the FBI into allegations of Kavanagh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her of leaving the European Union critics "playing politics" with the future of Britain and seeking to undermine the national interest.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May comes to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published after her photo on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called "Brexit" plan for Šaški, that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs and said that it was "total absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting Police arrested suspect Dytheon Simpson on the death of a LSU player
Police arrested a person suspected of killing 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported that Dytheon Simpson, who was 20, was arrested and imprisoned after he had been charged with murder of the second degree.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson's clash, and the police mentioned Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS's branch, WAFB, reports that the police took glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After interviewing Simpson, the police reported he shot Wayde to death.
The lawyer informs us that his release deposit is $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge Parish’s expert service published a preliminary report mentioning that the cause of death was a gunshot in the neck.
The unit pays tribute to the Luiziana State Police Runner Working Group, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the District People who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
The LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the district law enforcement for "excellence and justice enforcement".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 1.98-metre-old guy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
In the last season, a young man would, on average, throw 5.6 points in the game and catch 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is "shocked" and "shocked".
"It's always considered," said Wade.
The volcano spits ashes in Mexico City
From the Popocatepetl volcano, ashes erupted, reaching the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano when the crater was active and gas and ash emissions were recorded 183 times in 24 hours.
The center watched a lot of thunders and earthquakes.
The pictures in the social media show a thin layer of ash covering car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico, such as Chochimilke.
Geophysicists have noticed that the activity of the volcano has increased 72 km southeast of the capital since the earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Gojo has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the vote on independence, the police clashed with the Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters for independence crossed the riot police and thousands joined the demonstrations of opponents to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's opposition to the vote on secession.
The riot police who stopped a group of masks were hurled with eggs and powder paint, causing dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The police used the bats to stop the fight that started the next day.
Within a few hours, the groups for independence singing "Forgettable, unforgivable" encountered unionist protesters who shouted, "Long live Spain!"
The local press reported that 14 people were being treated for minor injuries during protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is sung by Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the region of independence.
The majority of voters decided to become independent, but due to the large majority of those who boycotted the vote and did not want to separate, the turnout was low.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year almost 1 000 people were injured in violent clashes when the police across the region tried to stop voting in polling districts.
Independence support groups set up a camp on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to change the route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narciss Termes, who is involved in a separatist protest against his wife, said that he was no longer certain about Catalonia's independence prospects.
“Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
I watched my parents shout joyfully when they could vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the vital and hard-to-reach victory of the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties struggled to keep up the momentum this year when many of their most well-known leaders either withdrew into voluntary exile or are in detention and are awaiting a trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequently proclaiming independence.
A 42 - year - old mechanic named Joan Puig, who had filmed a protest on his phone, said that the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is constantly growing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been imprisoned in pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidate in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonder — Men in a car parked
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after they re-entered the home in Londonder.
The incident took place on Thursday at about 7.30 p.m. (BVL) Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, the car could also have been shot with a crossbow.
Manga's blow gave Livingston a 1:0 victory over Rangers
The first goal of Livingston player Dolly Menga guaranteed victory
Livingston transferred to the upper league surprised Rangers by forcing Steven Gerrard, the head of Ibrox club, to lose the second of 18 matches.
The dolly-manga blow turned out to be very important, because in a moment Gary Holt's team aligned itself with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team in this Premier League season remains the loser of the tour match and will meet the leaders of Hearts next Sunday, from which they lag eight points.
Previously on Thursday, Rangers will play European League matches at home with Vienna Rapid.
At the time, Livingston extended its unmatched series of unsuccessful matches to six in the division, and Chief Coach Holt had not yet felt the taste of losing, because Kenny Miller was only replaced last month.
Livingston misses the odds in the match with Orthodox guests
Even before the Holt team scored the goal because of its perseverance, which is causing Rangers' various problems, it was long before it had to be ahead.
At first, Scott Robinson broke through and struck across the gate, and then Alan Lithgow slipped and couldn't reach Craig Halkett's head and he rolled off at the gate.
Hosts did not worry when allowing Rangers to play in front, because they knew that they could cause trouble for guests by creating standard positions.
That is exactly how the decisive goal was scored.
Rangers spent their free blow and Livingston started pushing forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson shared their efforts to pass the ball to Menga, which, after stopping it, earned the goal from the middle of the fine.
Since then, the ball has been controlled by Rangers, but the host's defence has been insurmountable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly has hardly been working.
This game continued in the second quarter, although Kelly had to work to counter Alfredoed Morelos' blow to the gate.
Scott Pittman shot the Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor hit his leg, and the next Livingston standard position was followed by the Lithgow-shield ball, which had been sent by the gate.
The transmitted ball was always in the Livingston penalty lot, but every time it was kicked out, and two requirements were imposed on the penalty – one due to Halkett’s collision with Glenn Middleton, who ran into the square after the change, and the other due to the ball’s touch by hand – were not satisfied.
Analysis of Phenomenal “Livingston” performance
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Maši Arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" game and result.
For all of them, they were excellent and continued to exceed expectations of an ever-increasing gameplay.
The style of the game and the staff have not changed since they returned to the highest league, but it is worth paying Holt great credit because when he arrived, he lit the team.
He was assisted by a lot of heroes.
Captain Halquett was a wonderful player, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worralle stay awake.
However, the rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they play well under the leadership of Gerrard, this time they were far short of reaching their level.
They did not hit very much the decisive blows, and only once broke through the defense of their masters. A certain alarm call to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was met in various ways in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), there were smiles and blue skies when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
The leaders argued about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police forbade the 25 000 gathered in front of a mosque for security, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom are Kurds, have also tried to be heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German Government’s decision to accept it in their own country.
Different protests show a division of visitors: some German Turks consider him to be a hero, while others call him a dictator.
Road accident at Deptford — A bicycle driver died in collision with a car
A cyclist in London died when he faced a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn streets, the busy Deptford Road, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. BVL.
The car driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident took place a few months after the death of another cyclist on Childs Street, struck by the perpetrator, who then escaped, about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
The city police said that the officers were trying to identify the person and inform his closest relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes are changed, drivers are advised to avoid this area.
“Long Lartino” Prison. Six officials injured during the turmoil
The Prison Service reported that six prison officials were injured during a major upheaval in a high-security men's prison.
The upheaval occurred in HMP Long Lart prison in Vussovershire on Sunday at 9.30 a.m. BVL, where it continues.
Special Tornado officials were called to control this turmoil, which involves eight prisoners and takes place in one wing of the prison.
Officers are treated for minor facial injuries at the site of the incident.
A representative of the Prison Service said: "In order to control the ongoing incident HMP Long Lart, specially trained prison staff were summoned in prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are sure that those responsible will be handed over to the police and, perhaps, will spend longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lart has more than 500 prisoners in prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, a prison manager was reported to be being treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot control officers were called to prison to contain the serious turmoil in which some of the workers were cast with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with its sudden floods (this may be beneficial for the dry areas)
It is not common for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rosa with his remaining energy stretches over the south-west of the desert and this will lead to a sudden flood risk.
The National Meteorological Service has already announced the surprise of a sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, spreading toward southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including Finnix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that on late Monday, as we approach the rain, Rosa will head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday.
In Phoenix, the National Meteorological Service noted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms or tropical depression status no more than 322 miles [322 km] from the Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane no more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National hurricane Centre predict that precipitation is expected to be 5-10 centimetres and that in some parts of Arizona Mogolon Rimo, precipitation is expected to be 5 centimetres.
Other areas in the southwest of the desert, including the central Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to reach between two and a half inches [2.5 and 5 cm] in height, and in some places may fall up to one inch [10 cm].
For people who are not threatened by sudden floods, Rose’s rain can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some may benefit from these rainfalls, as the south-west is currently suffering from droughts.
According to the US Drought Observatory, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from a very severe drought, which corresponds to the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels to the coast across the California Peninsula, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still likened to a hurricane with a huge wind of 137 km/h, is 619 kilometers south of the Euchenian Cape, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Storm is facing cooler waters in the Pacific region and is therefore calming down.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with a tropical storm force on Monday at lunch or evening.
Precipitation in certain parts of Mexico may be severe and present a high flood risk.
“From the California Peninsula to North-West Sonora, it is expected to reach 8-15 centimeters, but possibly up to 25 centimeters of precipitation,” reports Weather.com.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, and later on Tuesday morning, she will reach the border of Arizona as a tropical depression, and on Tuesday evening, she will go south to Utah through Arizona.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or its remains is the very high amount of rain in the California Peninsula, northwest Sonora and the Southwest of the US Desert,” reported the National hurricane Centre.
These rains are expected to result in life - threatening, sudden floods, debris in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Assault in Midsomer Norton. Arrested by four people suspected of attempting to kill
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested after a 16-year-old boy was found to be undernourished in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsamer Norton's Excelsior terrace zone, approximately 4 p.m. under the BVL on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable state.
The Ayvon and Somersett police reported that 17-year-olds, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in Radstock district at night.
Officials have approached any person who may have any video footage on a mobile phone about what happened.
Short says that Kavanaugh "has suffered from the evils and anger of the Democratic Party."
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice in which we would like to reject the ruthless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in his speech in Viling, West Virginia.
The short said that during his candidacy process, Kavanaugh had "experienced the evils and anger of the Democratic Party".
On Thursday, Kavanaugh witnessed to the convention, who strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he had been sexually assaulted several decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the Ford trial, he also witnessed his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said: “The Americans saw that day how good, noble, and brave Kavanaugh were.
“The vote for Judge Kavanagh is a voice for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, that is, a lawyer with a reliable reputation in the field of public services,” he said to a crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President implicitly referred to the candidacy of Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the Republican electoral activity in the mid-run elections.
"There are five weeks left until most important elections in our lives.
I am not present, although I am actually present," he said.
- That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Short said that the democrats wanted to "resist and hinder".
The senior assistant to the GOP CEO CNN said that the first most important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanagh should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths caused by the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami continue to rise
The authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were flooded because of the huge waves that hit the beach, when the severe earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
Hundreds of people gathered to the beach festival in Palu on Friday, when after dark, six - foot - high [6 m] waves began to knock on the coast.
After the tsunami, there was an earthquake of 7.5 points.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, so they became victims,” said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the GNPB Indonesian disaster relief agency in Jakarta during an information report.
– The tsunami did not come by itself, he put off cars, logs, houses, he hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coast, the tsunami was driven at 800 km/h on the open sea.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived it.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
The aerial photographs of the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridges were curved and destroyed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the seaside city continued to be shaken by repeated blows.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPT) reported that on Friday, the energy generated by the extreme earthquake was about 200 times higher than that of the nuclear bomb cast on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
It was reported that the tsunami could have become stronger because of the city’s geographical location, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as a "great" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were trapped under the ruins of buildings, later added that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage may be greater along the coast, 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Nugroho said that communications networks "were completely paralyzed, so no information was received" from Dongala.
"There are more than 300 000 people living there," stated the representative of the Red Cross, adding that workers and volunteers are going to the affected areas.
It was said that "this could be seen as a tragedy, but the situation could get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was very criticised without reporting that the tsunami struck Palu, even though officials said that the waves had come after the warning.
A man on the upper floor of the building, who excitely shouts about the approaching tsunami for people standing below the street, can be heard in the shared amateur material of social media.
Within minutes, a wall of water strikes ashore, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately approve the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused electricity supply disruptions, which led to the cut-off of the communication networks around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the aid.
The authorities reported that the army from Jakarta and other cities had started to send emergency cargo planes, but the evacuations still needed food and other essentials.
The city airport was reopened only for the purpose of granting the aid and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami had more than 800 victims.
That's very bad.
Dozeba reported that when World Vision personnel from Dongala safely traveled to Palau, where the workers were in the tarpaulin tents built in the office yard, they were accompanied by devastation.
"They told me that they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief teams began to take difficult steps to provide disaster relief, some people complained that foreign relief workers with extensive experience had been banned from travelling to Palau.
According to the Indonesian regulations, financing, provision and foreign personnel can only be helped once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
– When the government says, "Yes, it is a national disaster", we can call for international aid, but this status has not yet been published."
After the second night after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami in Palu, friends and loved ones of the missing people hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would affect the gloomy history of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers delivered the woman, who had been oppressed for two days under the ruins beside her mother's body.
The Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandon had trained two missing paragliders of the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"Because I am older in paragliding sports, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon described in detail how within a few hours of announcing the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, this news travelled through the paramilitary sports community. He desperately sent messages using the WhatsApp app for Palu competitors who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages contained only one gray tick, not two blue ticks.
"I think this means that messages have not been received," he said.
When filling in an ATM, thieves stole $26 750 from the entertainment center News on the Levie
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, the thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM at the entertainment center Newsport on the Levee.
“The driver of the car was working at an ATM in an entertainment complex and ready to add more money,” wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
While he was busy, another person "went behind the back of the Brink's employee" and stole the money bag.
According to a press release, the Witnesses noticed some suspects who had fled the scene of the incident, but the police were unable to determine the number of persons involved.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport Police by phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. Reper has changed his name to Ye
Reper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
After announcing changes on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Person, previously officially known as Kanye West".
For some time now, 41-year-old K. West has been called Ye, and he named it the eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began before the show "Saturday Night Live", where West was expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He has to replace the singer Arian Grande, who canceled the performance for "emotional reasons," said the show creator.
This is not only a shortening of the current professional title – K. West said earlier that this word has religious significance for him.
"I think that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you", – said K. West earlier this year when talking about the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and turned into just Ye, which means the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album more reflects who we are."
He is one of many known rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced the preferred names of Love and Brotherly Love.
West's former colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a dash and in capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador (abbreviated by AMLO) promises not to use troops against civilians.
The President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico has promised never to use military forces against the civilian population when the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of students is approaching.
López Obrador promised on Saturday that the Tlatelolco Square would "never use military forces to tame Mexicans".
On 2 October 1968, at a time when left-wing student movements began throughout Latin America, soldiers shot a peaceful demonstration in the square and killed 300 people.
López Obrador has solemnly promised to support young Mexicans by subsidising students every month and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities involved young people in criminal groups.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
“Since China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area,” says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence specialist who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were received after various U.S. government bodies published reports on artificial intelligence, even the fact that there is no formal strategy for artificial intelligence in the U.S. at all.
In the meantime, last year China presented its plan to lead artificial intelligence in innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and are waiting for another breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funding could double the probability that another major achievement of artificial intelligence will be in the US, as Lee said at CNBC this week's interview.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of Working Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", is the CEO of "Sinovation Ventures", who has invested in one of China's most famous artificial intelligence companies "Face ++".
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top American Othello player and later became Microsoft Research CEO and the president of Google China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions of the US Government, such as the "Robotic Challenge" of Defence Advanced Research Projects, and asked when there would be another one to help find more insightful people.
Lee said that US scientists often have to try hard to win government grants.
"It's not China taking away academic leaders – it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to step up its efforts on artificial intelligence.
"I believe that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be offered green cards automatically," he said.
In July 2017, the Council of State of China published its Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
Lee also said that the Chinese National Science Foundation is funding academics, just like the National Science Foundation and other governmental organisations are spending money on US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month DARPA (the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency) announced an investment of USD 2 billion for the AI Next initiative.
NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, in the coming months, nothing has been done with regard to US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonian people vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a Sunday referendum on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia is an action to resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the province of Macedonia is located, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents claims on Greek territory and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments agreed on the proposed new name, but opponents nationalists say that changing the name would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether voter activity would reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to enter into force.
The referendum question was put on the voting card: 'Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU in agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zaran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, is worth paying the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, Macedonian youth, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will stick to the vote and make it decisive.
It would take a two-thirds majority in Parliament to change the name.
The State Electoral Commission has announced that no reports of violations were made before 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast their votes.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in Skopje.
Macedonian parliamentarian Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško vote in a referendum on the change of country's name in Macedonia to open the way to joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of a parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of tents that were built by boycotting referendums.
“We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to join with raised heads instead of entering the servants’ door,” said Kavadarkov.
– We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and take part in the integration of Eurasia.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, will attract much-needed investments.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that the result "Yes" would be "assurance of our future".
According to the results of a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian political research institute, 30-43 per cent of voters should participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV Telma, 57 percent of the respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said that they would vote "Yes".
For a referendum to succeed, 50 per cent of voters must participate plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious failure of the pro-Western government's policy since it took over power last May.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero overcomes Brighton's defense and profit goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's defense, and the Manchester City team on Saturday, playing at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, achieved victory with a score of 2:0.
At the 65th minute of Aguero, the goal was scored, it would seem, incredibly easy.
Argentinian attacker got the ball in the middle of the square at the beginning of the attack.
Before he broke into the open field, he ran out between the three defenders of Brighton.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirt players.
He slipped through one defender, before passing a few others at the edge of the Brighton finest court.
Then handed the ball to the left where Sterling was.
An English striker returned the ball Aguero with a kick from a fine point, and this right foot punched the ball to the right side of the gate network, overcoming the Brighton gatekeeper Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with feet,” said Pep Guardiola, the head of the City.
- We said he'd play for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he won the goal at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who helped Sky Blues to get ahead of this Premier League game.
The goal was 29 minutes.
At the time of the attack, Aguer received the ball while in the depths of the Brighton court.
Along the left side of the square between two opponents, he gave the ball nicely to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball forward with several kicks while Sterling was pushing toward the next kettle.
Sky Blues launched the ball into the gate just before it came out of the square.
On Tuesday, 12 noon, 55 min., City meets with Hoffenheim Champions League Group matches in Zinsheim Arena Rhein-Neckar (Germany).
Scherzer wants to play a friendly game with Rockies
After Nationals fell out of the playoffs, there were no valid reasons to force it again.
A competitive Scherzer hopes to overcome Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have the chance to remain in playoffs; in the national league, West is one point ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers.
With the result of the Rockies on Friday evening 5:2 overcame Nationals, at least the chance to get a preferential map, but still have to try to secure the right to play in the first division.
“Although we play for nothing, at least we will be able to run to the court knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where a crowd of people will gather and another team, will probably be at the highest level we will be able to achieve this year.
Why don't you compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting composition of the Sunday match team, but in this case they are clearly inclined to throw the ball at the Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will have 34th of this game in the barrel, became a quitter on Thursday and will take the position of a pitcher on his regular rest day – Sunday.
Washington right-handed statistics for this season: 18-7, 2,53 ERA and 300 eaves in 220 2/3 quarter.
A Short Language in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the mid-term elections, the President implicitly mentions the situation regarding Bretto Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have achieved will be placed on the balance in November.
There are five weeks left before perhaps the most important elections in our lives.
It's very important, I'm not running... but I'm actually running, that's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Then he went on to say, "You see this terrible, terrible Democrat group, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means, you see how low it is, how evil it is.
They don't care what they hurt, how they climb over to get power and control; that's what they really want – power and control – but we won't give them that."
The democrats, he said, have a mission "to resist and hinder".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "wicked, ugly, lowly and unjust people."
He referred to the Senate Court Committee by mentioning the name of Dianne Feinstein, the Senator of Democrat, which led to huge ovation of the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, uh, like.
No, uh... no, I'm waiting for one – it was really poor body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour has lost its diversity of views.
They do not condone those who openly express their opinions
When Momentum activists voted in my local party for distrust of me, I don't think it should have been surprising.
Finally, I am the latest of Labour parliamentarians who have been told that I am unwelcome, and that is for their opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, received similar threats because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
For me, mistrust has been expressed by criticising me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Because of the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically, for similar issues that Jeremy has not agreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want many members to be involved in the meetings and that meetings should be productive."
For most of the eight years when I am a local Labour Parliamentary, on Friday evening, the meetings of the GC were exactly that.
It is sad that today the tone of many meetings is not so much and the promises of a "softer, more pleasant" policy have long been forgotten, even if it has ever been implemented.
It is increasingly clear that a different opinion in the Labour Party is not tolerated and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues, who, as I had previously believed, have similar political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees around and follow opinions that I would never agree with, whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and no matter what – the social media add tyrada insults that encourage my withdrawal, condemn the Centre's policy and say that I do not belong in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I was much more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to withstand an avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things of this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same views, and with every 'failure' procedure or change in the electoral system, this party is becoming increasingly inferior.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to avoid jumping off, talking so loudly, and then "everything will be fine".
But I didn't come to politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher Government, which, in the true sense of the word, destroyed my entire school class, I have been trying to achieve better public services for those who need them most – whether they are a member of the local council or a minister of government.
I have never concealed my policy, including the recent elections.
No one at Nottingham East should in any way have been surprised at my political opinions and areas of disagreement with the current leaders.
To those who encouraged this procedure on Friday, I can say that, when a country is digging towards Brexit, which will be hit by households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, one message I have from Nottingham Momentum for my constituents, Labour Party members (or not): I am proud to serve you and promise that no threat of revocation or political expediency will stop me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and the best interests of all of you.

Ayr – Melrose – 38:17 Insurable Ayr conquers the tops of tables
Two late attempts have slightly distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves this triumph in the impressive, promising Tennent's Premiership day game.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one is not overcome.
In the end, their victory was brought by impeccable defense and well-exploited opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We have raised all the tests during all the matches that have taken place so far, and we are still invincible, so I am really happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said: "Ayr has turned out well, players have used their chances better than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt at 14 minutes, which was successfully completed by Frazier Climo, led Ayr forward, but the yellow card for the Scottish Rory Hughes, released by Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect figures, and Baggot stopped an unsuccessful attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a fine when, in the middle of the game, he achieved a score and successfully completed his personal test by helping Ayr to break off before the break with a result of 17:5.
However, Melrose started the second quarter well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was successfully completed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
The game was stopped for a longer time because Ruaridhas Knott suffered a severe trauma and was taken out of the spot on a stretcher. After the game was extended, Ayr continued to push forward when the Stafford McDowall's attempt was successfully completed by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair McPherson, received a yellow card and Melrose tried to use the excess of players, but Bruce Colvine's attempt at the end of the fierce pressure was not effective.
The home team player came back, however, after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without a ball, MacPherson pressed the ball off the penalty line for the continuing Ayr fight.
Clim's performance ended, as he had already done since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe had stopped David Armstrong's kick in the square and prevented Gregor Henry from holding the fifth home team's test to score points.
Still Game star seems ready to start a new career in restaurant industry
The Ford Kiernan star of Still Game seems ready to move to the accommodation and catering sector, when it turns out that he has been appointed director of the licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man in the popular BBC comedy plays Jack Jarvis, writes the script and plays with Greg Hemphill, his long-standing comedy partner.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last season of this show, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Kraiglang.
Official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although Scottish Sun's sources mentioned that Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's "breathing restaurant business".
"We belong to the sea": Bolivia, imprisoned on land, hopes that the court will open the way to the ocean again
Sailors patrol the navy headquarters in La Paso.
The flag of the ocean blue floats on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, marine bases are decorated with a slogan: “We are rightfully part of the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In Bolivia, imprisoned on land, there are still living memories of access to the ocean that Chile had to sacrifice in the 19th century’s bloody conflict on resources – a lively and longing to once again waking up in the Pacific Ocean.
The hopes that have been cherished in recent decades have now been greatly strengthened, as, after five years of reflection, Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be published on 1 October.
"Bolivia is united in the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes to see positive results", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will monitor the publication of the TTT decision on large screens, in the hope that the Hague Tribunal will take a positive decision on the Bolivian complaint by obliging Chile to negotiate access to the coast of Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, the Indian, who is facing a controversial electoral struggle for re-election, is also very interested in the outcome of Monday's decision.
"We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to think that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia — even if it did, little would change.
A UN institution based in the Netherlands has no power to cut off Chile and has indicated that it will not identify any possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the TTT decision will be published only six months after the last arguments were heard is hardly a sign that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
And even if Bolivia had made some progress, the last four years could have knocked her back.
"This issue of access to the sea was unlawfully raised by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She believes that any remnant of Chile’s good will was destroyed by Morales’ vengeful rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but after all, it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has remained ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, opposed the idea that the judgment was given abnormally quickly.
"On Monday Bolivia will have a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and to end the 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, and uses the issue of the sea as a political manipulation.
“Bolivia will never deny the right to have access to the Pacific,” he added.
"Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to live with the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, assures us that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises, which were agreed by the leaders of the rival countries at a meeting in Singapore.
His comments were made at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to have been planning to renew the entrenched nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says that the "utopian dream" is that the continuation of sanctions and the withdrawal of the US declaration on the end of the Korean war could ever bring North Korea down.
Washington avoids accepting the declaration unless Pyongyang first makes convincing disarmament efforts.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang does not seriously intend to abandon the arsenal that the country seems to see as its only guarantee of security.
Pompeo is going to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for the second Kim and Trump meeting.
Paris fashion show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headwear, and they will soon conquer the nearest fashionable shops
If you want to replenish your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is just for you.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne introduced a wide range of eccentricly large headwear in their collections in spring and summer 2019, and in his style he simply shocked the viewers of the Paris Fashion Week.
These extremely impractical hats conquered the social network Instagram this summer, and these designers presented their eye-catching works on the podium.
Valentine’s unique work was a huge body - colored hat decorated with a wide, featherlike edge covering the head of the dummy.
Other non-standard size accessories were gemstones, sorcerer's hat and even pineapple – but they are not designed to protect your head from cold.
Thomas Browne also introduced a collection of strange masks – at the right time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks were sewn together with lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of the tracks looked like a diver suit with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other looked like a dissolved ice cream nozzle.
And if you follow this giant fashion trend – you won't.
Stylus’ experts suggest that these huge covers can enter stores.
Huge hats became popular with La Bomba high heels, straw hats with two foot edges were worn by everyone – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural trademark, which created extremely impractical hats that conquered all social networks, released another huge piece of work on the podium – a straw beach basket, almost the same size as the mannequin carrying it in a swimwear.
The red brick raffia basket, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, became an exceptional highlight of the collection La Riviera SS19 in Paris fashion week.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitagee said: "I think there will be huge hats and beach baskets coming to shops next summer because the designer has had such a big impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for extra-standard accessories."
John Edward: “Language competence is a key skill for the citizens of the world”
Scottish independent schools improved their academic record by not losing ground in 2018 and again demonstrated outstanding exam results, which were only further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other community merits.
When more than 30 000 pupils are enrolled in all Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide their pupils and their parents with the highest possible level of service.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen career and to be citizens of the world.
As we work in the education sector, which can design and implement the school programme, we can see that modern languages continue to be popular and choose them willingly in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you are able to speak to someone in a language that he understands, he will understand your mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to him in his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to establish a relationship and build trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of this year's recent exams, languages are laudable at the peak of popularity and have the best maintenance ratings in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of foreign - language students received the highest A rating.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A rating in the Mandarinian language exam, 72 percent of those who studied German, and 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland see foreign language skills as a key skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as optional are now considered to be of the same importance as basic subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
According to a survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, 17 percent of all the reasons for employers’ difficulties in filling jobs were language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming more and more necessary to equip young people for their future careers.
As employability will depend heavily on languages in the future, these skills become essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses in a second language, he or she will be far superior to others in the future if he or she has these skills that he or she needs throughout his or her life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will make people with several languages much more competitive.
According to a 2013 survey conducted by YouGov, involving more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language sufficiently well to attend the interview, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for the children of the present.
Learning a number of languages, especially in developing countries, will improve the chances for children to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school varies according to the languages it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in view of the future of 2020, such as mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever the best interests of your child, there will always be many languages to choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are ready to create a learning environment that will equip children and provide them with the skills they need to live in the future.
It is not denied that languages remain vital for the future of the country in today's global business environment, and this must also be reflected in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and results for Scottish youth.
That must be done.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron on Sunday will launch the Lakers debut in San Diego
There was little left to wait for the fans to see LeBron James start the season at Lakers in Los Angeles.
Luce Walton, the Lakers trainer, announced that James would play in the Sunday season opening competition with Denver's Nuggets in San Diego.
But the exact number of minutes to play, it's not clear yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," said Walton on the official "Lakers" website.
Lakers reporter Mikey Trudellas said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited period of time.
Earlier this week James was asked about plans in six pre-season matches in the Lakers team.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need a pre-seasonal match to get ready," he said.
Short talk in the YouTube channel in West Virginia
President Donald Trump starts his campaign tonight in Viling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Short speeches next week, including stops in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Following the approval of the procedure for suspending the nomination of the candidate of the Supreme Court, Mr Trump seeks to mobilise support in the forthcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans were threatened with losing control of the Congress during the vote in November.
What time will Trump’s talk take place in West Virginia this evening, and how to watch it online?
Short talk in Viling, West Virginia, scheduled at 19:00 Eastern time in the evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online on YouTube below.
The short subject of this week's candidate of the Supreme Court, Bretto Kavanaugh, is likely to be touched because she has become very tense about allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour when the Senate voted in favour of suspending the candidate until one week before the FBI conducted its investigation.
But the main aim of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength in the run-up to the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign states that the aim of these five meetings next week, as announced by Reuters, is to "energise volunteers and supporters in the Republican effort to defend and extend the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Congress control is so important on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, because the campaign season is beginning very hot," said the spokesman of Trumpas, who did not want to reveal his name.
"The speech planned at Wesbanco Arena in Wiling should attract sponsors from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of Pittsberg media," says Metro News of West Virginia.
On Saturday Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, a state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
A short attempt is being made to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who, according to polls, is in the lowlands of ratings.
"This is not a good sign to Morrisy that the President had to come to the top of the ratings," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Ryder" Cup 2018 tournament: US team is militant and expects to get to Sunday unit matches
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the fours can be exactly what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a fluctuation in success is entirely fictional, but the players really believe it, especially in competitions like this.
Whose side is success now?
"They were leading by six points, and now four points, so I guess we can consider it a little success," said Jordan Siethe in preparation for the day.
Of course, Europe is leading the way, has a four-point balance and there are 12 more matches ahead.
The American enthusiasm, according to Sieth, is fading and not missing, not to mention the form of Sieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each scored three points out of four.
Siethe was invincible from beginning to end and impeccably ahead.
In order to finish the fourth match, Thomas scored two points out of two possible.
His blow, which won them at the 15th hole in this macho, was accompanied by similar shouts that seemed to say that the American team was not at risk of ending.
"You just have to focus and take care of your own match," Siethe said.
Now each of these players has to play separately.
To the successful end - 18 wells.
The only players who scored more points than Siethe and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but adorable couple from Europe have gathered four points out of four possible and can be calm.
"Molywood" was the only couple who did not need extra blows not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
That course of events and the reaction of the raging spectators only confirm that they will be the players who win on Sunday and no one else will be able to achieve the same popularity as Fleetwood or Molinari, who have the chance to win Europe when the last suns hit the Le Golf National field.
It would be good if the two were to succeed in different wells at the same time.
Although it is too early to talk about Europe's glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played with Sergio Garcia, the eastern hero of four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two double strokes in the series of the first nine pits forced the Spaniard and the Swedes into trouble from which they could not escape.
But no one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
The four-ball and four-ball games are so interesting to watch for the interaction between couples, for the advice they give and do not give, and for the fact that the strategy can change instantly.
Europe has better played as a team, so decisively came to the finals, but this four-stage has also shown that the US team has the backbone of the fighter, which some, especially in the states, doubted.
On the last day of the "Ryder" Cup, Europe is leading 10:6
Europe will meet on the last day of the Reeder Cup with a significant leverage, leading to the United States at 10:6 a.m. after Saturday fours.
The inspiring Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari duo continued to heat the atmosphere by winning two victories against Tiger Woods, who fought hard, and began to take the lead in Le Golf National by four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, in order to preserve the trophy that Hazeltine had lost two years ago, dominated the fourths of the morning against the failed American side and ended the stage with a result of 3:1.
The U.S. demonstrated more resistance in the fours when he won two games but failed to overcome points of magnitude
Jim Furyk's half needs eight points of the 12-piece match on Sunday to hold the trophy in his hands.
Fleetwood is the first newcomer in Europe to win four points in a row when Molinari and Molliwood duplicated after the sensational weekend, and they are only the second couple who won four points during their first four games in the history of the Rider Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed on the four stories, they flawlessly defeated Woods, who lost confidence, and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even better result at 5:4.
Woods, who otherwise beat two Saturday games, showed a high level of professionalism at some points, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his four games, seven of them in a row.
In the morning Justin Rose was resting in four and returned to play with partner Henrik Stanson in four, with a result of 2:1 defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk, the world's first and third place in rankings.
Despite the pleasant, gentle breeze of the day in the southwest of Paris, Europe has not gone through everything like butter.
Three times, the winner Jordan Siethe and Justin Thomas raised a cartel for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
In a four-ball macho they won a difficult victory by 2:1 against Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter, while in a four-ball macho they defeated Paul and Rory McIlroy by 4:3 without hitting the ball into the first two wells.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team managed to win a four-point shift to single matches, although Furyk's side would be enough to hold the trophy.
Although two days in second place, Sunday seems to have been a turning point.
North Korea says it will in no way disarm unilaterally, without trusting
The North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that continued sanctions exacerbate their mistrust of the United States and that in such circumstances the country will certainly not unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho has told the General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea has taken “goodwill measures” over the past years, such as halting nuclear missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test base and committing itself not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we did not get a similar response from the US side," he regretted.
"If we have no trust in the US, we will not be able to rely on our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally."
As long as North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to the staged approach to nuclear disarmament were repeated in the course of North Korea's actions, his statement was distinguished by the fact that it did not completely reject the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to work on the "Deployment of the Korean Peninsula" and Short promised the security of North Korea.
North Korea is reaching the formal end of the 1950-1953 Korean war, but the United States says that Pyongyang first has to give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to relax severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US demands nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure for sanctions to achieve its goal by forced methods, even by refusing the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
“To think that we can be brought down by sanctions is the same thing as for people who do not care about us to pursue utopian dreams.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim and Trump meeting, which was highlighted by the US leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: "If the other country on this issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea rather than the US, the issue of the Korean peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have reached such a dead end."
However, the tone of Ri's speech has changed dramatically compared to last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that when Mr. President of Evil, Trump called Kim the "missile gentleman" preparing a suicide mission to direct North Korea's missiles to the US was absolutely inevitable.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, boasted of the courage of Kim to take steps towards disarmament, but said that there was still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea meets the requirements of nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time schedule for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have said that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State, Mikey Pomeo, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must continue decisively without any concessions until complete and conclusive evidence of nuclear disarmament is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the backstage of the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to shake the ground for the next meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that all progress was just to make North Korea announce a few hours later that he made "gangster demands".
At its meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile base and the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim claimed that the "appropriate measures" he sought were the security guarantees that Short promised in Singapore and a shift towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to rest
This year’s new course at Harvard University encouraged all their students to sleep more in order to fight the growing match culture in their studies, using caffeine and sleeping at night
One academic found that students at the best university in the world often do not even have basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and Brigam City, a specialist in women’s hospitals, has developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the U.S.
Inspired to prepare this course he visited after talking about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the speech, a girl came to me and said: "Why am I told about this only now, in the last year of my studies?"
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said, "The Telegraph."
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains how the most important quality sleep habits help students to achieve academic and sporting results and improve their overall well-being.
Paulo Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and executive director of the university’s health service department, said that the university decided to offer this course when it turned out that the students had a significant sleep deficit per week.
An hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section contains a photo of the dormitory room where students can click on a cup of coffee, curtains, simulators and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how lack of sleep affects sports performance and how important it is to go to sleep routines.
In the following section, participants learn how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the student town with interactive icons that encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
“We understand that this will not change the behavior of students at once.
But we think they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health consequences when you choose to smoke", explained Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to stay awake overnight, according to him, still exists. Modern technology and the increasing pressure on students have led to the growing problem of sleep deprivation.
"Ensure that enough and high quality sleep has occurred, there should be a student secret weapon to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety," he said, "even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep turns the brain into starvation mode, so the students are constantly hungry."
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler train when he attended one of his subjects last year, in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask the whole student town for a course.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all postgraduate students to this course before starting to visit this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up an alarm clock when it is time to go to sleep, just as it is lifting, and avoid the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and LED lighting, because they can blow your circadian rhythm out of balance, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: The men's goal of the men was saddened by Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another disappointment when Dolly Menga in Livingstone managed to overcome the weakened Steven Gerrard with a 1:0 result.
Ibrox was hoping to win its first victory on the trip after the triumph of February in the result of 4:1 St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team overcame Gerrard for the second time in 18 matches in the lead position, and now the latter team is already eight points behind the leaders of the fled Prime Minister's League at Hearts.
The Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but the Ringers, who played without inspiration, did not see any chance to equalize the result.
Rangers have now fallen to the sixth place, Livingston has risen to the third place, and only one goal is behind Himbernian.
And the troubles of Rangers don't stop because it's likely that the butter from the tribunes hit the side judge Calum Spence in the head and hurt him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed him to bypass Ayr and lead him to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, trusted the same monk who took the point from Hearts last week, and he would have liked his well thought-out combinations to lock up opponents at every step.
Rangers dominated the ball by controlling it, but having it, Livingston did more.
They could have hit for the second minute, when Menga gave the ball to Scott Pittman, who was invading the gate of Allan McGregor, with a close blow, but he destroyed his chances of turning the ball away from the gate.
After a long shot by Keaghan Jacobs, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner defender Alan Lithgow asked him to pass by.
Rangers took over control, but the last third of the match was only an hope, not a belief in their game.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a punishment when he met Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson took his hand in Colombian's complaints.
Rangers managed to hit only twice in the first quarter, but Liam Kelly, the former Ibrox gatekeeper, was hardly frightened by Lassana Coulibly's blow to his head or by the gentle presence of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the 34th-minute goal of "Livi" may not match the course of the match, no one will argue that they deserve it for their efforts.
Rangers failed again to overcome the viscous Jacobs' defense.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his self-control and handed Menga to easy completion.
During the recess, Gerrard took action to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and that re-change almost immediately resulted in theft when the guards of the land played Morelos, but Kelly, with his spectacular play, ran to repel the blow.
"Livingston" included guests in the game, which they loved – with distant transmissions of the Lithgow and Halkett ball.
Holt's team was able to increase its leverage at the end, but McGregor defended himself against Jacobs' shock after Lithgow's filing from the corner.
After the change, the Rangers player Glenn Middleton once again appealed at the end of the match about the penalty after the crash with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years ago and MORE... On that day, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, this device has become a hit of the world of science, and later a hit of popular culture, when the 1950s film Bells of Coronado was played by cowboys not particularly reminiscent of scientists Roy-Jus Rogers and Dale-James Evans:
The man said, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear how atoms touch radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Hey, it's shooting now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that received his name continues to exist.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells and kill them
The vaccine has taught the immune system to recognise bad cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their replacement in a laboratory
The cells can then "see" the proteins that are specific to many forms of cancer and are re-injected back
The test vaccine has produced promising results in the treatment of patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who has been treated with this vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells, has lost cancer of the ovaries for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory, then the cells can see proteins specific to HER2 type cancers and are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
“HER2 promotes several types of cancer growth, including breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, whereby immune cells are extracted from patients and learned to target cancer cells, was successfully applied in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West released the Short Support Tirad, wearing the MAGA cap, after his performance on the FNL show.
It didn't end well.
After an incoherent performance, the audience of the Saturday Night Live studio was ashamed of the calls of Kanye West, who praised U.S. President Donald Trump, who said that he would participate in the 2020 campaign.
After performing the third song "Ghost Town" that evening, during which he wore a cap bearing the inscription "Make America Great", he further condemned the democrats and expressed his support for Trump.
"How many times have I had to talk to white people, they would say, "How can you like Short, for he is a racist?"
Well, if racism were a problem for me, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The FNL show started with a comical stage where Matt Damon mocked Bretto Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Court Committee for accusations of inappropriate sexual behaviour by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not broadcast, the video was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock with West's replies to social networks.
It is not clear if Rock tried to mock West.
Furthermore, West complained to the audience that he had had trouble behind the scenes about his head covering.
"They mocked me behind the scenes.
He said not to go there with a hat like that.
They mocked me!
They said I reached the bottom," he comforted Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see what the bottom is? ” he asked.
"Begin your love."
His speeches at least twice aroused dissatisfied shouts in the audience and the members of the broadcast of the FMD seemed ashamed, as reported by Variety. One person said to the media: "The whole studio was filled with fatal silence."
West was invited to change singer Arian Grande quickly because her ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with his performance, during which he performed the song I Love it, wearing a Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, who published a post on Twitter: "One of the bravest people of the spirit: AČIŪ FOR THE CONDITION OF MINIQUES."
But the chat presenter, Karen Hunter, has posted a post on Twitter that West was just "self-evident and it's amazing."
“But I choose NOT to buy a person (by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his "art") whose beliefs are poisonous ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we are also free," she added.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first creator who changed his name, but walked the same path that Diddy had already crossed, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dougg was originally called Snoop Lyon; the legend of music Princess changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.

"Sost War" star Next Harrington criticizes a distorted view of masculinity
The next Harrington was known as the sword-smooth character John Snau HBO in the fantastic adventure series about the Middle Ages "Sost Wars".
But a 31-year-old actor criticises the stereotype of a match hero, who says that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they must be tough to be respected.
Speaking at Sunday Times Culture, Next said that he thought "something was wrong" and asked how to combat the problem of distorted masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married a 31-year-old colleague named Rose Leslie, the star of "Sosto Wars", admitted that this topic "has a strong touch" on him.
"I feel that this topic has touched me hard now. Where have we made the mistake of developing masculinity?" he asked.
"What do we teach growing men that we are facing such problems?"
Another believes that this distorted wave of masculinity could, in part, lead to television being responsible because it creates very male characters.
He continued: “What is inherent, but what is learned?
What is taught on television or on the street that young people believe that they should have this type of masculinity?
I think this is one of the important issues of our time – how do we change this?
Obviously, we made a mistake somewhere with the young men."
He also confirmed during the interview that he would not participate in any prehistoric or follow-up of the "Sosto wars" when the series was over next summer and said that "he already had enough battlefields and horses".
Since November Next one will film Sam Shepard's True West version. It's a movie about a movie director and his brother's robber.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that had happened to him in creating "Sosto wars" – he met his wife, Rose.
“In this series I met my wife, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life,” he said.
Emmy won the fantastic series Rose played Igrit, the love object of another character John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 in property belonging to the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14 % in new cases
China reports an increase of 14% in the number of citizens infected with HIV/AIDS.
According to health authorities, more than 820 000 people were infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, alone, 40 000 new cases were reported.
Most newly infected people have been sexually transmitted, which is different from past statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infections in some parts of China rapidly spread as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But in this way the number of people infected with HIV has fallen to almost zero, as indicated by the Chinese health authorities at a conference in the Province of Junan.
However, over time, the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS in China has increased to 100 000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a sensitive issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is widespread.
As conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually lead women.
The majority of cases of infection with the disease are due to inadequate protective measures during such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines as one of the ways to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked the Republican Senator's data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters denied the suspicion on Saturday that one of its employees had published the personal information of three republican US senators on the pages of the legislator Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat believed that the charges were made by ultra-right wing experts and websites.
"Mell, lie and once again a rotten lie," said Waters on Twitter.
The information disclosed included home addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill at the time when the Senate was dealing with allegations of improper sexual conduct against the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh.
The delinquent information appeared a little later when these three senators asked questions to Kavanaugh.
“Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported an IP address that identified the source of these records in relation to the Waters Office and disclosed information as a member of the Waters staff,” reports the Capitol.
"These unfounded allegations are completely false and absolute lies," continued Waters.
"A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these false and false suspicions is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded allegations are absolutely false and absolute lies."
Waters' statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, including from Ari Fleischer, the former spokesperson for the White House.
"This denial sounds evil," Fleischer wrote.
“It says that she does not have enough self-control to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't defend himself.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He should be calm and humble."
It seems that Fleischer tried to compare the reaction of Waters with the Democrat critique of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who participates in the mid-term election campaign to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"True, if not a lie," he wrote.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office had informed the institutions and enforcement bodies concerned of these false accusations.
"We will make sure that the organisers are made clear, it continues, that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous for all my employees without exception."
Review of the Comedy "Jonis Inglišas Strikes Again" – breathed spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
The same thing seems to be true about the revival of the action spy comedy franchise "Jonis Inglišas" – "Jonis Inglišas" started to show in 2003, and in 2011 returned to the screens with the comedy "Jonis Ingliša Resurrection".
Will this sarcastic autosaty about how clearly we failed become a new opportunity for national exports?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has a second chance to bring unpleasant truths to the surface with wide eyes and a rubber face.
Of course, this silly secret agent, who, despite his claims to luxury, also acquired some of the features of Inspector Clouseau, some of Mr. Beno's features and a little sprinkling like that guy, a hint of which was used to create the theme of the drama "Ugnies transports" used at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also a little based on the character of the traveler and the mysterious man who caused the chaos Atkinson once played in the now forgotten advertising of Barclaycard TV.
This latest Johnny Inglish movie has a few beautiful moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the rotor of the shoulder hit his helmet.
Comedy Atkinson's talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems to be exhaled and strangely excessive, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and "Mission Impossible" boldly insert comedy elements.
Humor is as if it were more for children than for adults, and Johnny English's unexpected adventures don't look as inventive and as peaceful as Atkinson's silent jokes when he plays Mr. Bean.
The most common topic at the moment is that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker successfully broke into Britain's super-secret spy web network and revealed the identities of all British spies in this area, causing the agent's indignation – too insignificant the role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop to the cup of the Prime Minister, a pompist and cornered character, who already suffers from a crushing political unpopularity: Emma Thompson from the character representing Teresa May squeezes everything he can, but in the scenario there is little good material for that.
Wise advisers inform her that all her agents have been identified and that she will have to look for people among retired people.
This means that we will have to address Johnny English, who currently works as a school director in some fancy institution, but who provides illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent.
The English is sent back to Whitehall to discuss the state of emergency and there meets a long-standing Bough of its common, which Ben Miller plays again.
Bough's a married man with a submarine chief now, and Vicky Pepperdine, who plays a majesty girl, seems to be underexploited.
So Batman and Robin, who are capable of messing up all things in Her Majesty's secret service, are again taking action and meeting Olga Kurylenko's fatal beauty Ophelia Buletova.
The Prime Minister has a dangerous head-up by a charismatic billionaire who says he can solve the problem of British computers, namely the villain Jason Walta, who is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: they are dressed as waiters, they are causing a fire in a French restaurant, they are causing chaos on the luxury Volta yacht, and English is starting a complete anarchy, trying to use the headphones of virtual reality to get to know the interior of the Volta house.
All the stopcades were clear to keep this last series, but no matter how pleasant or wild it is, all of this is much reminiscent of child television.
It's pretty mediocre.
As for other Johnny Inglish films, I could not get rid of the idea: is the British film industry not able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really be worth his talent?
Labour Party denies creating a plan for Britishs for working four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyno Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but to pay for five days.
It is reported that the party wants company managers to share the savings accumulated as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving their employees one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy the three-day weekend and to bring home the same wage.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and its plans to steer the country's development towards workers.
The transition to the four-day working-day week was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to reap the benefits of a changing economy.
One of the high-ranking Labour Party sources The Sunday Times said: "The review of the political provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of employees, as well as the overall strategy of the party's industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also promised to do so during the four-day week of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this idea is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party representative said: "Four week of working days is not party politics and this is not discussed in the party."
John McDonnelli, representative of the Shadow Government, took the opportunity to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economic sphere at last week's Labour Party conference.
Mr. McDonnelli said he was determined to recapture power from "faceless dictators" and "profit hunters" in utilities.
Such plans by the shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover their full share, because if they see the wrong, the Labour Government can deduct something.
It also approved plans to include employees in the company’s board of directors and to create equity funds to transfer 10 per cent of the capital of private sector companies to employees, which could receive dividends of up to GBP 500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the 60 Minutes question whether the FBI's investigation of Mr Kavanaugh can change their views
In the course of the investigation by the FBI concerning the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote was postponed for at least a week on whether it was to be appointed to the Supreme Court, and the question arises whether the findings of the Bureau of Investigation could have an impact on the opinion of any of the senators of the Republican Republicans in such a way that they would no longer support that judge.
The 60 Minutes interviewer Scott Pelley on Sunday asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it could happen that the FBI will find out something that will change their opinion.
Senator Kennedy seems to take a more relaxed approach than his South Carolina colleague.
"Well, yes, of course," answers Mr Kennedy.
“As I said when I was going to the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, when these charges appeared, I called him and asked him, "Did you do that?"
He answered decisively, firmly, unambiguously."
Thus, Mr Graham's opinion would seem to have been replaced by nothing.
"I have decided on Bretto Kavanaugh, it would be really shocking accusations," he says.
"For Dr. Ford, I don't know what it was, but I know one thing: Bretto categorically denies it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘No one can confirm what it says.
It's 36 years.
I don't think anything new will come out."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive goal of eradicating poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in the Grand meadow of Central Park, the World Citizens Festival will meet tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread the message about the real goal of the event – to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens’ Festival started in 2012. It is a continuation of the Global Anti-Poverty Project – an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the visitors of the concert had to perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, calling on the phone or otherwise meaningfully helping to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But are the citizens of the world successful in achieving this goal? 12 years to the deadline.
Will the idea to reward people with a free concert really convince them to demand and urge them to act? Maybe this is just another example of what is known as clivivism, fictitious activism – people think that they will really change the situation by signing an online petition or posting an entry on Twitter.
According to the organizers of the World Citizens Festival, since 2011, the movement has registered more than 19 million actions of its sponsors, which promote a wide range of objectives.
They say that, under pressure from these actions, world leaders have announced USD 37 billion in commitments and policy strategies to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group identified 390 commitments and declarations triggered by the group's actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that almost 649 million people worldwide are already directly affected by the guaranteed funds.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor-executor partnership that "helps children grow up and reveal their full potential". Having received over 4 700 Twitter messages from the world, she promised to give Rwanda US dollars to help solve the problem of malnutrition in the country.
"With the support of the UK Government, sponsors, national governments and such people as you, the world's citizens, we can make social injustice such as malnutrition a thing of the past," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Nutrition Power, to the audience in London in April 2018.
The group also pointed out that the government announced funding for the "Food Power" project, which would bring about nutrition interventions of 5 million women and children, following 5 000 calls to improve the diet of mothers and children in the United Kingdom.
In reply to one of the FAQs on our website, which asks, "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?",
The people of the world answer: “This is a long and difficult way, and we will sometimes stumble and fail.
However, like the great movements for human rights and for apartheid, we will win because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the performers who are taking part in this year’s event in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will lead the event.
According to the Secretary of Home Affairs, the US can use the fleet to block Russian energy exports
"Where necessary, Washington can use the fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets as well as markets in the Middle East," says U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Mr Zinke says that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that Russia is interfering in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the area of energy, just as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," R. Zinke said with the available knowledge.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States can do this by means of the fleet, can ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, can take the blockade and ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Mr Zinke said this to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the U.S. "the voice of energy consumers".
He then compared the methods of Washington with those of Russia and Iran and noted that they were essentially the same.
"Iran's and Russia's economic alternative is to find a larger or smaller counterweight that would replace fuel," he said and also called Russia a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements appeared in the course of Mr Trump's administration's mission to increase the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia in the market, which offers European consumers a much cheaper opportunity.
Therefore, the officials of the Short Administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the supposedly inadequate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Mr Trump, led Berlin to become a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, the reason for Washington’s opposition to this project is purely economic, and it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US's position has been counterproductive for Germany, and it has reaffirmed its determination to continue with this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I really do not agree with the interference of the third state in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), following the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, says that she will seriously consider presenting her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
On Saturday, Elizabeth Warren, the senator of Massachusetts, said that she would seriously consider the issue of presidential candidacy after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting at the City Hall of Holjok, Ms Warren confirmed that he would consider candidate.
"The time for women to go to Washington to manage our failed government, they must go to the highest position," she said in the Town Hall.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether to take part in the presidential election."
During the meeting in the town hall, Mr Warren reprised President Donald Trump, saying that he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very frightened by the way Donald Trump treats our democracy," she said.
Mr Warren openly criticises Mr Trump and his proposed candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter message published on Friday, Mrs Warren says that "the FBI definitely needs to be investigated before the vote".
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in the Warren state themselves believe that they should not stand for presidents in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Centre for Political Research and Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the expected Masachusetts voters say that the senator should not participate in the elections.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick receives more support – 38 percent support for his potential candidacy, and 48 percent speak against it.
Other names discussed regarding possible nomination for 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
J. Biden says that he will make a formal decision in January, as reported by Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Tracko Palino’s post-traumatic disorder at the Donald Trump’s gathering
Trackas Palin, a 26 - year - old man who entered military service in September, spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, following an incident of domestic violence, he was arrested and charged.
"I see what my son is going through, what he is facing when he comes back to everyday life, so I understand other families who are feeling the consequences of a post-traumatic disorder and some injury of our troops with whom they are returning", she told the audience at Donald Trump's assembly in Talsa, Oklahoma.
She said that the son and other war veterans "turn back a little, they return a tougher heart, they return doubting whether they will receive respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all other soldiers have given to their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, indicted for domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as for the obstruction of reporting domestic violence with weapons and drunkenness, as reported by Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Vasila Police Department.
18 States and the District of Colombia support resistance to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge against the new US policy of refusing asylum for those fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, 18 states and representatives of the district submitted comments from amicus curiae (judicial consultant) in order to support the challenge of asylum seekers' policy, report to NBC News.
The applicant’s full name in Grace v Sessions proceedings, which the American Civil Liberties Union began against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She says that her partner, "and members of his criminal gang," was violent against her, but on 20 July the U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many asylum applications are received in the USA, as countries suffering from the problems of violence and domestic violence by regular gangs.
The new US asylum policy overturned the decision of the Board of Appeal of Immigration of 2014, allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum fleeing domestic violence.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Karl Racine, said on Friday in a report that the new policy was “despite the laws of the state, federal and international for decades. ”
"Federal law requires that decisions on applications for asylum be made in the light of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that this prohibition violates the principle," says amicus curiae.
In this note, lawyers also argue that policies prohibiting immigrants from entering the country are detrimental to the US economy and that immigrants are more likely to do business and "provide the necessary work services".
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered judges dealing with immigration issues in June to stop granting asylum to those fleeing domestic violence and the victims of gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or certain political views," said J. Sessions in his policy report of 11 June.
The objective of asylum was never to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems that people face every day around the world).
As the number of victims increased twice in Palu, the remaining survivors were desperately sought.
The situation of the survivors is constantly deteriorating.
“The tension is very high,” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, calming her fever-stricken baby's son in Palu city evacuation center.
“The speedy one continues to carry more and more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water."
It has been observed that residents return to their ruined homes, collect heavy - water items, and try to save what they can find.
Hundreds of people are injured, and the 7.5-point earthquake hospitals are packed.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Harris, who experienced back and shoulder fractures, were placed outside the Palu Army Hospital – while the hospital continued to undergo severe repeated strokes, patients were treated outdoors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he relates how he felt a severe earthquake in the hotel’s fifth - floor room, where he and his wife and daughter were staying.
“There was no time to save others.
I think I got through the ruins of the wall," said D. Harris Associated Press and added that he and his family came to the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, hereinafter “silence”.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're healthy."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of being intimidated by propaganda advertising
A week later, when an official Chinese newspaper distributed a four-page ad in a US daily, praising the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda using the American press.
The U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday a supplement paid by China Daily to the state newspaper Des Moines Register of Iowa and accused China of influencing the US Congress elections on 6 November. China denies this accusation.
"The accusation by Mr Trump that Beijing is trying to influence the US elections marks a new phase of the growing Washington campaign aimed at exerting pressure on China," said US officials to the Reuters Agency.
Although it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, and both countries are fighting at tariffs for the import of each other's goods.
According to Chinese and US experts, Chinese retaliation rates were targeted at exporters of Iowa and similar states that supported the Short Republican Party.
Terry Brandad, the US ambassador to China, former long-term governor of Iowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural products to China, claimed that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
On Sunday, in an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register, T.Brandad stated that China "was even more mocking when it started to print propaganda ads in our free press."
“The Chinese authorities used American freedom of speech and press to spread propaganda and ordered a paid advertising message “Des Moines Register,” wrote T.Branstad.
"In the meantime, in the local Beijing press kiosk, you will not find conflicting voices and you will not create a real picture of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, because the press is under the hard pad of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
Mr Brandtad also added that "one of the best-known Chinese newspapers has escaped the offer to print" his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: As the mid-run election approaches, B. Kavanaugh fiasco was deterred by Republican voters
Although many Republican leaders remain loyal to the High Court candidate Bretto Kavanagh, who was accused of sexual harassment, an analyst warned that this would result in a negative response to the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The emotions caused by the situation are extremely strong, and many Republicans already state formally that they want to vote.
Such things cannot be taken back later," said Professor Grant Reeher of Maxwell School of Syracuse University in a Saturday article published in The Hill newspaper.
Mr Reeher expressed his doubts as to whether the last-minute calls by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to launch an inquiry into the FBI would be enough to reassure evil voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will remember it both tomorrow and November," said Chief Advisor and National Representative of the progressive group "MoveOn" in Washington on Friday, Jean-Pierre.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted: "The November is coming!" at a demonstration in the Senate lobby, when the Republicans controlling the Court Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, kzip reported to Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will touch across the globe,” said unbiased political analyst Stu Rothenberg.
- People say it was already strong, and they're right.
But it could further strengthen the position, especially between undecided female voters in the suburbs and those aged between 18 and 29 who, although disliked by the president, often simply do not vote."
Even before Ford made public statements, when she detailed the charges of sexual harassment against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts claimed that if the Republicans confirmed the candidacy, this could lead to outrage.
"This caused great confusion for the Republican Party," said former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republicans Michael Steele at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not only about the committee or the final vote, it is not only about whether Kavanagh will be appointed a judge, but also about how the Republicans have managed this situation and how they have dealt with Mr Ford," Guy Cecilas said to the news channel, the director of Priority USA – the group assisting democrats in the elections.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to believe after the statements by Mr Kavanagh and Mr Ford, even though they are getting a little more support.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they believe in B. Kavanaugh completely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believed that Mr Kavanagh was really or probably lying in giving testimony, and only 30 percent felt the same about Mr Ford.
In response to the invitation of Mr Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Mr Ford and the statements of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported to The Guardian.
Mr Ford swore to the Senate Court Committee last week, saying that Mr Kavanaugh was sober when she was 17 years old.
D. Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at the party they visited while studying at Yale University in the 9th day.
Web inventor plans to set up a new Internet to resist Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the global network, is creating a new starter to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor Inrupt is a company based on the Berners-Lee Open Source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who has access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of Inrupt is to control the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the startup.
- It's a historic moment."
The Solid technology-based app allows people to create their own personal online data store (POD).
It may contain lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work equipment.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify are available in one browser at the same time.
The personal data online store is unique in that only the user decides who can access the information.
The company calls it personal empowerment through data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and the necessary skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several programmers hired to work with this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not agree with Facebook or Google about changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a report published on Saturday by "Media" Berners-Lee says that "Inrupt's mission is to provide trading energy and an ecosystem to protect the durability and quality of the new Solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a Web Consortium at the Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I feel a great optimism about this new web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann, honored, is a clergyman awarded with the Victorian Cross in the First World War
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary, the only Anglican church priest was honored in his home town and was awarded the Victorian cross as a fighter during the First World War.
Lieutenant Colonel Pastor Bernard Vannas earned the award on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Belengliz and Lucuru.
Unfortunately, after four days, the pastor was shot by a sniper, so he remained unaware that he was awarded the highest-ranking British army.
During the parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, two grandsons exposed the memory stone.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that the fact that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandpa's winning feat, is "excellently symbolic".
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918 a lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the Saint-Kenten's Canal "in the midst of a very thick fog, in the midst of a heavy blowing of fire from guns and automatics."
Later, he hurried to the firing line and led the line forward "in a particularly gallant way", and then alone attacked the cannon and killed three fighters of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something that would never be equal to him, but that, at the same time, it was a very inspiring thing for meekness. ”
After the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Michale and his brother Dr. James Wan laid the crown.
Michael Vann said that he was honored to participate in the parade, adding: “The bravery of the true hero is shown by the support that many people will give. ”
MMA fans didn't go to bed all night to see Bellator 206, but had to be satisfied with Kiaulyte Pepa
Imagine: you don't go to bed all night to see Bellator 206 packed, but eventually you don't get to see the main sight.
There were 13 fights in the San Jose post office, of which six in the main card and live in the United Kingdom all night through Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., while Geggard Mousssi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for the fight, the film Kiauly Pepa, which interrupted the broadcast, struck the audience in the UK.
Some viewers, to put it mildly, were not impressed, for it was this fight that prevented them from falling asleep until the morning.
In the Twitter, one of the fans called the replacement of the broadcast with a children's cartoon "a joke of some morbidity."
"According to the rules established by the government, at 6 a.m. such content was not appropriate, so it was necessary to turn on the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, the chief marketing and communication vice-president of Bellator.
"Yes, "Pep's peek."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said that in the future efforts will be made to adjust the timetables to the viewers in the United Kingdom.
"When I think about the repetition, it seems to me that we could probably do it," said Cocker.
“But at that time there is 6 a.m., Sunday, and we would not be able to solve this by Sunday our time – Monday their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, as the broadcast changed, a lot of messages were exchanged that were not all friendly.
We tried to remedy the situation, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it's a question of power.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do. We wanted to give more to fans, but we simply failed.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tomas Daley felt unfulfilled because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24th athlete claimed that he only understood that he was not the same as everyone in the main school.
For the first time in Radio 4 by Lauren Laverne, Desert Island Discs, he said that he was talking publicly about gay rights because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that it was less important to win the Olympic Games when he became a father.
Kirsty Young, the permanent host of this long - term program, left work for several months because of illness.
During the first L. Laverne show, whose guests are asked to imagine travelling to a desert island, Mr Daley said that he was growing up feeling inferior to everyone else, because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said: “To this day, that feeling of lowliness and otherness was an incentive that gave me the strength to succeed. ”
He said that he wanted to prove himself worthy of this, so that he would not disappoint others when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic bronze medals has become a high-level LGBT activist and has taken the opportunity to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality by participating in this year's Commonwealth Games of the British Nations.
He said that he had started talking about it in public because he felt that he was lucky enough to live openly without any consequences, so he would like to give others such hope.
Three times the world champion said that it was unexpected for him to fall in love with his husband – US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Last year, Daley married an Oscar 20-year-old winner, but says that the age gap never caused problems.
According to T. Delay, when you survive so much when you are so young, he participated in his first Olympics only 14 years, and his father died of cancer three years later – it is difficult to meet someone who would be of the same age, but has experienced the same heights and lows.
After the couple became the parents of their son Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, Mr Daley's perspective changed completely, he said.
“If you had listened to me last year, I would have told you that I wanted to win the gold medal,” he said.
- But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
My son's name is the same as Grandpa Roberto, who died of brain cancer at the age of 40 in 2011.
Anto Daley, Father did not want to accept death, so one of his last questions was whether the tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games, which he intended to watch while sitting in the first row, had already been purchased.
“I could not tell him that he would not live so long that he could sit in the first row,” said T. Daley.
“I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally acknowledge that he was not inviolable,” said T. Daley.
A year later, the athlete competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I just knew that I dreamed of it all my life – jumping into the water while watching local audiences at the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the selection of the first song for the programme – Heather Small’s “Proud” track, which answered his feelings in preparation for the Olympics and still warms the skin.
Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 broadcasts on Sundays at 11.15 a.m. British Summer Time.
After losing the form, Mr. Mickelson spent the Saturday Ryder Cup tournament on the bench
Phil Mickelson, an American, will score a record on Sunday, because he will be taking part in the Ryder Cup tournament for 47 times, but he will need to improve his shape considerably in order to prevent it from becoming an unlucky anniversary.
Mr. Mickelson, who is already playing for the 12th time in two-yearly competitions, was seated on the bench by Captain Jim Furykas at the four-to-fourth Saturday competition.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as was often the case in the United States, five times the main winner spent part of the day in the support team, and the rest of the day he improved his equipment in the field in order to correct the mistakes that prevented him from playing.
Even on the high ground, having not hit very straight, 48 athletes are not the ideal player in the narrow Le Gold National squares, whose long rough grass stretch is particularly unfavourable to inaccurate hits.
In addition, as if the course itself were not frightening enough, in the ninth match, which will take place on Sunday, Mr. Mickeyson will play against the extremely accurate British open tournament champion Francesco Molinari, who, along with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, won all four of this week's matches.
If four-point Americans manage to start the upcoming 12-point match well, Mr. Mickeyson's match can become absolutely decisive.
Furykas expressed confidence in his player, but he probably couldn't speak differently.
“He fully understood the role he had today, spread over my back and, hugging my hand, said he was ready to play even tomorrow,” said Furykas.
- He does not lack self-confidence.
It is on the list of the most glorious athletes and both in the past and this week has given a great deal to these teams.
Maybe I had no idea he was going to play two matches.
I imagined more, but it went like this, so we decided that we would do it.
He wants to play like everyone."
On Sunday, Mr. Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and become the biggest player at the Ryder Cup matches.
It is possible that this will mark the end of his Reeder Cup career, which is not equal to the heights of his personal records.
Mr Mickelson owns 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draw, but Fury says that his presence has brought the team no value.
“He is cheerful, sarcastic, witty, he likes to laugh at people and is a great guy with whom it is fun to be in the team room,” he explained.
– I think it was fun for younger players to compete with him this week, too, it was good to look at it.
It brings much more than the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big deal can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great deal of leverage in the run-up to the last Rider Cup unit competition can easily turn into a hard fight.
The Danish athlete debuted in 1997 in a macho in Valderama, where the team of opponents led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had five points over against the Americans, but the finish line was cut only as soon as the result was 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"We constantly remind ourselves that we had a great deal of power in Valderama; we had a great deal of power in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderama, where we won only barely," said T. Bjorn (in the photo), who watched the 2018 show's victory with a result of 5:3 on Friday and 10:6 on Le Golf National Square.
So the story will show me and all team members that it's not over yet.
It's gonna take all the strength tomorrow.
Go and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not finished.
We have a goal – to try to win this prize – so we need to pursue it consistently.
I've always said, I count on those 12 players who are on our side, but we know who stands on the other – the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a complex field, T. Bjorn added: “I would never like to anticipate myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a whole different hair.
Tomorrow's individual game will be the most important – it's something else.
It's great to play with your partner when things go well, but when you're alone in the field, you're tested at the limits of your ability to play golf.
This idea needs to be introduced to players – tomorrow we will have to squeeze everything out of ourselves.
Now we're going to have to split up with our partner, and he's going to have to squeeze everything out of him."
Unlike Mr Bjorn, opponent Jim Furykas expects his players to appear more individually than as partners, except for Jordan Siethe and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the surprises of the last day because he was in Brooklyn in a winning team before Europe performed the miracle of Medina and turned them into losers."
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, asked when Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players to prepare for the last day in 1999.
- Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but try to start quickly – as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, very tense becomes the middle match.
Accordingly, we have formed our team and released players in a way that we know... we are trying to create some kind of magic tomorrow."
Thomas will have the task of trying to fight counter and compete with Rory McIlroy at the top of the match, while Europeans are led by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pooler.
“I chose these guys in this order, because I think they will successfully beat the whole game,” told T. Bjorn about his choice for unit competitions.
The delivery of the new German military vessel was postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy had to start work as early as 2014 and replace the military ships of the Cold War, but, according to the local press, we will not see it until at least next year due to the increasingly perishable systems and the extremely high price.
According to the military representative quoted in the newspaper Die Zeit, Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new frigate ship of Baden-Württemberg class, is now postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship had to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was overshadowed by the problems of the ship that had already been delivered.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen class fregat.
It is believed that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, and certain security technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance intervals, which allow the newest frigates to sail far away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, the endless delays in cutting-edge technology mean that military vessels that are supposed to allow Germany to divert military power to overseas territories will become obsolete before they are put into service.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate was placed under the headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the navy returns a ship that has already been delivered to the builder.
The reason for the return is little known, but the German press mentions a number of major software and hardware defects that would have made the ship useless in the military mission.
Deficiencies in the software are particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class of ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, which is half the size of the Bremen class's older Fregats.
In addition, it has proved to be a very heavy ship, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to introduce various improvements in the future.
It is estimated that 7 000 tonnes of Rheinland-Pfalz are twice as heavy as the class of ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
The cost of the whole project – alongside perishable technical equipment, including crew training – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from an initial amount of EUR 2.2 billion to a staggering EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems of the latest phregat have become particularly significant following recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chief of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the military fleet is actually "in short for the need of usable vessels".
The official stated that problems had developed over time because old ships had already been written off, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the Frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
A new study carried out in a Scottish highland manor is aimed at revealing how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
Findings are expected to provide new knowledge of the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future environmental activities.
Researchers of National Trust for Scotland will watch in their research the bats, soprano bats, brown ears and watery mice in the gardens of Wester Roso Inverevo.
Special recorders will be arranged in certain areas of the territory to allow tracking of bat activity throughout the season.
The staff of the National Health Service and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of all sound recordings will determine the frequency of signals emitted by bats and the type of activity.
A map and report of residential habitats will then be created to help shape a detailed picture of behaviour across the landscape.
“National Trust for Scotland” (NTS) environmental adviser Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat is most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of maintenance work in residential habitats, such as the creation of grasslands, as well as how best to maintain wooded areas in order to be suitable for bats and other associated species.
Over the past century, bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have fallen.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development works that affect hatcheries and destroy habitats.
Windmills and lightning are also a threat, as are flycatchers, some chemicals used to process construction materials, as well as hunting domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, ears rather than eyes help to catch the prey during night hunting.
Bats shall accurately determine the location of insects or obstacles in the flight path by an intricate echolocation method.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very responsible for bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, hatchery inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first and only bat-specific reserve in Scotland in the Thaave Manor in Damfrey and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of Scottish bats live.
Manor overseer David Thompson says that the manor area is ideal for them.
“We have a great place for bats in Threave Manor,” he said.
- We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and great areas to live in.
But we do not know much about bats, so work here and in other places will help you to understand better what they need to flourish."
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before starting maintenance work, as accidental destruction of one hatchery could lead to the death of up to 400 female and juveniles, which could lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats shall be protected and shall not be killed, irritated or disturbed, nor shall the destruction of their hatcheries be prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish bat guard officer, called on the public to contribute to the rescue of bats.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don’t even know how many local species are going. ”
Ronaldo rejected charges of rape – lawyers intend to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the accusations against him the rape of "melagiens" and said that people using his name "want to be famous".
His lawyers are ready for the German newsmagazine "Der Spiegel", which published the charges and brought them to court.
Portugal and Juventus club forward forwarder is accused of rape of American Kathryn Mayorg in 2009 in the Las Vegas hotel room.
The Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he then allegedly paid the woman $375 000 to keep the incident silent.
Speaking to 142 million followers live on Instagram several hours after the statements of charges, Mr Ronald criticised the reports for 33 years and called them "melagiens".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today – liars – said five times when the "Ballon d'Or" winner looked at the camera.
- They want to be famous using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous, to say my name – it's part of my work.
I am a happy person, it's all right," said the athlete with a smile.
According to Reuters, Mr Ronald's lawyers are going to sue Der Spiegel for accusations which they called "unacceptable publicity of allegations of private space."
Associate Christian Schertz said that the athlete would seek compensation for "moral damage the amount of which would correspond to the significance of this violation – probably one of the most serious violations of personal law in the last few years."
It is claimed that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in Palms casino and hotel apartments in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed with Nevada Clark County Court, after the nightclub meeting Ronald and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room, where he allegedly raped her by anal rape.
According to Mr Mayorga, after the alleged incident Ronald fell on his knees and told her that he was "a 99 percent good man" betrayed by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
According to the documents, Ronaldo acknowledged that the couple had sexual relations, but he claimed that they had been contractual.
Mr Mayorga also states that she appealed to the police and that her injuries in the hospital were photographed, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "feared of retaliation" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
A 34-year-old woman says that she is now seeking to withdraw the agreement because she continues to feel traumatised by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronald was able to join the Italian giant Juventus from Manchester United to Real Club in Madrid, and this summer he signed a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexitas. The United Kingdom would forever regret losing car manufacturers
According to business secretary Greg Clark, the United Kingdom would "forever regret" the loss of the status of world leader in car manufacturing after Brexito.
He added that he was concerned about the statement by the Toyota UK branch in the BBC that the British withdrawal from the EU without an agreement would result in the temporary cessation of production in the Burnstone factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said G. Clarkas.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the loss of border mortality in the event of "Brexit" without an agreement would mean job losses.
The Burgaston plant, which manufactures Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain suddenly withdraws from the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production," said Burnstone Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, have also voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and its effects on international trade.
For example, BMW says that after the month of Brexit will close its Mini plant.
According to the car manufacturers, the most worrying threats to the Brexit supply chain without contract are.
Toyota's production line works when needed, as parts are delivered from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a treaty on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border; according to this industry, this may lead to delays or shortages in the delivery of details.
Toyota claimed that it would not be able to keep more than one day of stock at the Derbisshire plant, so production would stop.
According to Clark, The Chequers Plan, which provides for future relations with the EU, is "designed precisely to avoid such border checks".
“We need a contract. We want to have the best contract that, as I say, would allow us not only to enjoy success today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said to the BBC Radio 4 programme “Today”.
"In addition to Toyota, data from other car manufacturers show that it is necessary to continue to have access to a very successful supply chain system."
Toyota could not say for how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has been working for 24 years at the Burnaston plant and who is responsible for the Unite trade union meetings, said that his trade union members are increasingly concerned: "I say from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never return."
A representative of the Government said: "We have proposed an accurate and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
According to the White House, Short meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
"As the fight for the candidate for the Supreme Court continues, Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for a week," the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, relations between Short’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The question of whether Trump would dismiss the Deputy Prosecutor General, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been inciting rumours in Washington for months.
This month, New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the use of a microphone for talks with Short and the possibility to remove the president through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this report.
However, in the wake of the announcements of his resignation, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
The short said that he did not want to fire Rosenstein. Later, the meeting was postponed so as not to coincide with the meeting of the Senate Court Committee, where both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused of ill-treatment.
On Friday, Short FBI ordered an inquiry into the allegations made by Kavanaugh in a week, thus postponing the vote again at the plenary session of the Senate.
Short spokesperson Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday in Fox news show.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It has no date, and it may take place this week, but in view of all events related to the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to press the news."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conference in the White House.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that press conferences rarely take place because they do not like TV journalists who are "seeking for effect". True, they added: "I have to agree with the fact that they seek effects for the audience."
He then mentioned that Short would be more likely to communicate with the press directly.
"The President answers more frequently than any previous president," she said, and without any evidence, added, "We have reviewed these statistics."
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do so and you have seen that this has been happening many times in recent weeks, and press conferences will be replaced by your direct contact with the President of the United States."
A short answer to questions is constantly coming out of the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with respectable guests.
One person’s press conferences are rare.
The free and sometimes strange appearance of the President against journalists this week in New York probably explained why.
Health Minister wrote to NST staff from the EU on Brexit's concerns
The Health Minister wrote a letter from the EU to the staff of the Scottish NST expressing his country's gratitude and willingness to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in the public service sector entrusted to it.
In a letter from Mr Freeman, he wrote: "The UK and EU negotiations on exit continued in summer and are approaching the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the UK Government started to prepare more quickly for a possible scenario without a contract.
I know you're all very worried right now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how I value the contribution of all workers, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the performance of the healthcare system and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is indeed your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Emergency surgery by Christian Abercrombie after head injury
On Saturday 31:27, Christian Abercrombie, an Abercrombie defender of Tennessee State Tigers, reported that he had lost the match for Vanderbilt Commodores.
The chief trainer at Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the trauma occurred just before the break.
"He came to the side line and it just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and doctors at the Abercrombie sideline gave oxygen to breathe, and later they laid it on a stretcher and sent it for further research.
"Tennessee State" official Chris Harris of Nashville (Tenesis) WSMV said that the Abercrombie operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center was completed.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type and extent of the injury," and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it happened.
Abercrombie, who was officially affluent in the sport season, moved from Illinois and plays the first season in the Tennessee State team.
Before leaving the match, on Saturday he recaptured five balls, and the total number of rebounds he had made during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers purchasing real estate in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp duty
According to New Tory Plans, foreign buyers purchasing property in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp duty and additional money will be used to help homeless people
This step will reduce the risk posed by the successful Corbyno campaign aimed at attracting young voters
According to the UK authorities, the Commission considers that the measure constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
The Ministry of Finance expects to be able to raise up to GBP 120 million a year to help homeless people
Today, Theresa May announces that foreign buyers buying property in the UK are going to be charged a higher stamp duty and use the additional money they receive to help the homeless
With a view to ensuring more affordable housing and targeting high-income people, this step is expected to reduce the risk posed by the successful Jeremy Corbyno campaign aimed at attracting young voters.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on non-taxpayers and companies in the UK and the additional money received will be used to promote the government's campaign against homelessness.
The additional fee – paid next to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for the rent of second houses or houses – can reach as much as three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this step to enable up to GBP 120 million a year to be collected.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built real estate is bought by non-UK residents, which leads to higher prices and makes it more difficult for first house buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, so many rich countries and especially the regions of the capital became ghost cities.
The new strategy was presented just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty, thus helping more young people to acquire their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by quickly buying up the land, but not using it, and called on May to address British housing shame by abandoning affordable house quotas.
Corbyn has announced a number of eye-catching housing reforms, including rent controls and a ban on eviction without fault.
He also wants to give more power to the municipal councils to build new houses.
May said: “Last year, I told you that when I was prime minister, I would try to restore the British dream – life must be better for every new generation.
Which means we need to clean up our troubled housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is not right that non-residents in the UK and companies established abroad can buy their homes as easily as hard-working British people.
The dream of housing has become almost impossible for many people, and the threat of humiliation of homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish team”
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that his ultimate goal is to become the leader of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scot likes the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in the third place of the first league and is three points behind the first club.
Last season after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship, this summer he moved to Stadium of Light.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I went to the B team and it ended," Ross told the BBC for Scottland's Sportsound.
“But when I grew up in Hamden Stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish national games, it always moved me back.
It is true that this opportunity will only happen if I manage the club successfully."
To Ross, Sunderland was led by Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neillas, Royőus Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Having rejected the offers of Barnsley and Ipswich Town in the past, the former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel worried about starting to work after such well-known managers in such a large club.
"Now my success will be assessed according to the answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Premier League?"
According to the structure and conditions, this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to take him there, but I’ll probably just get the club back to the league and think that I’ve been successful here.”
Ross's leadership career lasts only three years. Previously, he worked as the manager's assistant at Dumbarton Club and replaced Hearts coaches for 15 months.
Later, he helped to recover from Alloa, who fell to Division Three, and turned St Mirren's club, which was threatened to fall down, into the championship winners the next season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than he has ever felt as such during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy clubs.
"This change was probably radical," he recalls about the leadership of Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that it was better for me to lead than for playing.
It sounds strange, because I was lucky, made a lot of money, and I was happy with the success.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of problems to deal with every week.
And now it's not easy – working stress and stress, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do it. When I grew up, I always felt that I was in my sleigh, but leadership is the most satisfying thing."
You can hear the full interview during Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, at Radio Scotland at 12:00p.m. at English Summer Time
The studies found that the best time for a pint of beer was Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased the income of the poor brewers in Britain, but it has made the burden of restaurant networks even more difficult.
The figures revealed that in July sales of beer and bars groups increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants the income decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting company that produced this data, said: “The unending sunrise and longer - than - expected England’s participation in the world championship meant that in July, the trend was similar to that in June, when brewery’s income increased by 2.8 percent.
In June, shopping in restaurants decreased by 1.8 percent, and in July the situation became even worse.
The results of beer brewers and bars with the main income from the sale of beverages were undoubtedly the best, and sales in them increased more strongly than in restaurants.
Although not as strong as the restaurant industry, the sun has also hit the main producers of beer from the food trade.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sale of drinks in well-cleaned beer and bars this month has increased by 6.6 percent, and the sale of food has fallen by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, from RSM, a company that analyses the leisure and hospitality sector, states: “These results continue to follow the trend that has been seen since the end of April.
With regard to catering establishments, the main factors remain the weather and the impact of major social and sporting events.
It is not surprising, therefore, that groups of restaurants continue to struggle. True, the fall of 4.8 percent of sales over a number of years will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to the continuing cost-related pressure.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for the food businesses who receive the most income from trade. Time will show whether the milder temperatures in August will provide the necessary respite."
The overall increase in sales in beer and restaurants, including the newly opened sites, was 2.7 per cent in July and reflected the slowdown in the development of the networks belonging to the brands.
In the UK, a sales monitoring tool for the brewing, bar and restaurant sector, recognised by the Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyses business data from 47 existing groups with a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion.
One in five children has social media accounts hidden from their parents
Research shows that one in five children – some just 11 years old – have social media accounts that are hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20 000 high school students revealed that the number of fake "Insta" pages is increasing
The news has strengthened fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had to show their parents a basic account
One in five children, some just 11 years old, create hidden social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20 000 high school students revealed that the number of fake Instagram pages is increasing rapidly – this is a link to the photo sharing website Instagram.
The news has strengthened fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said that they use a censored basic account to show their parents, but they also have secret accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found out that she insisted, "Pull me."
A study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11×18 year old students have two accounts, and half of them admit that they are hiding their accounts.
Mike Buchanan, leader of the MDC, said: "The temptation of so many teenagers to create virtual spaces where they cannot be found by parents and teachers is alarming."
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle was elected as its director consultant at the General Annual Meeting of the Management Body of the Scottish Sports Council.
Ian Beattie described this step as an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from the various experiences she has gained over the past decade at international level.
“Eilidha has earned great respect throughout the sports community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we have no doubt that its inclusion in the board will bring great benefits to sports in Scotland,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I really want to serve as an athlete's voice, and I hope that I will contribute and help to lead sports in Scotland."
An American who won the 1996 Atlanta Games and a total of four Olympic gold medals, now appearing as a permanent BBC expert, was unable to walk after a short-term ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell you if and to what extent I will recover.
I had to work until I was exhausted, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I am doing exercise in mobility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Breastmill ad, where mothers are compared with cows, has received different ratings on the Internet
The breast-dressing company received different views about its advertising, where feeding mothers are compared with dairy cows.
In order to mark the beginning of the trade of a product described as the world's first quiet portable breast lift, the consumer technology company Elvie has published an inspired advertisement for an ironic musical video. It aims to demonstrate the freedom that the new mower gives to feeding mothers.
Four true mothers in the hay carvid dance in sound recordings, for example, such words as: "Yes, I pray myself, but no tail is seen" and "If you don't notice, this is not udder, this is my breasts."
The appendix continues: “Get him out, get him out, feed him the babies, get him out, get him out, lie to my beautiful ones. ”
However, the advertisement published on Facebook has caused an online dispute.
The video, which was viewed 77 000 times and received hundreds of comments, has responded in different ways, many of them claiming that it overlooks the horrors of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to promote this product is a very poor solution.
Like us, they must conceive and give birth to produce milk, but their newborns are taken away from them a few days later," wrote one woman.
Elvie breast throttle invisibly fits in the power bra (Elvie / Mother)
Another commented: “It’s understandable that it hurts both the mother and the newborn.
But why don't we use them for advertising a breast-dresser for mothers whose babies don't take away?"
And someone added: "The code is a total misunderstanding."
Another commentator defended the advertising – one woman admitted that her song turned out to be "very fun".
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy it if I still fed it.
When I cut off my milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant," wrote one.
Another commented: “This fun advertisement is for mothers whose milk is withdrawn (often in workplaces or toilets) and feels like cows.
Its purpose is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry.'
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that all of them danced with their bras, which were not visible.
The idea of the campaign is based on the insight that many women who break breast milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie drawer does not produce any sound, does not have wires or pipes, and invisibly fits in the power bra, allowing women to move freely, keep babies, or even leave home when they withdraw the milk.
Mother's partner and executive director Ana Balarin commented: Elvie's drawer is a revolutionary product that deserves to be sold boldly and provocatively.
When we compared the feeding women with dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the interruption of milk and all the challenges it poses, at the same time showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new dairy mill will bring.
Elvie's throttle has been placed in the headlines for a number of times.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski's collection of two children's mother showed on the catwalk using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camps on the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border during the month has not changed substantially, but the number of children detained by migrants has increased significantly, partly because the strict rhetoric and policies of the Short Administration have made it more difficult to accommodate them with carers.
Traditionally, most guardians were immigrants themselves without papers and were afraid that applying for custody of a child would put at risk the possibility of staying in the country.
The risk has increased further when the Federal Government announced in June that potential carers and other adult members of their families will have to provide fingerprints and these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, Chief Officer of the Immigration and Customs Service, witnessed to Congress that the institution had detained dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors of adults.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously tried.
“Almost 80 percent of these people – guardians or their family members – live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to persecute these individuals", said Albence.
According to the shelter's staff, in order to consider children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules, which require some children to appear in court within a month of detention and not within 60 days, as usual.
Many will try to defend their request for legal status against a judge on immigration issues by means of a conference video call rather than a personal one.
Those recognised as non-eligible will be deported quickly.
According to the shelter's staff and the reports received from the system in recent months, the longer the children remain detained, the more likely it will be to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent breakthroughs or attempts to escape.
Defenders say that this is even more worrying in large institutions, such as the Tornilo Shelter, where the size increases the likelihood of noticing signs of a child’s suffering.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends may deepen the traumas that many have already suffered.
Syria ordered the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In addition, in response to the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been taking place for eight years.
Moualem, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces under the pretext of the fight against terrorism on Syrian soil were illegal and would be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011 and millions had to leave their homes, the war on terrorism was almost over.
He said that Damascus would not stop fighting this sacred struggle until we wipe out both terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in all parts of Syria.
There are approximately 2 000 US troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and President Bashar al-Assad on opposition to Syrian Arabs.
France has more than 1 000 land soldiers in a country devastated by the war.
Speaking of the refugee problem, Moualem said that the conditions were good for them to return, and at the same time accused some Western countries of spreading an unfounded fear that deters refugees from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will receive reconstruction aid only after Assad and the opposition have reached a political agreement and have ended the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel fortress in Idlib has created the conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on a province with three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement contained clear terms and expressed the hope that military action would be directed towards the jihadists, including fighters from the Nasra front linked to Al-Qaeda, which would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura expects to convene shortly the first meetings of a committee composed of the Government and members of the opposition to prepare the draft post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for the elections.
Moualem set out the conditions under which the Syrian Government will participate in the Committee, the work of the Group should be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against any interference.
Why will Short be elected for the second term?
According to this logic, Short would be elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators probably expect, his presidency would be prematurely completed by impeachment and scandal.
Of course, this would be the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!
There are no signs of spectators' fatigue so far.
Since 2014, the best broadcasting time ratings on CNN television have increased more than twice to 1.05 million and MSNBC to almost three times to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of the best broadcasting time, which grew from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show ranks first on cable with 3.5 million viewers on the main news evenings.
"This is a fire that attracts people because we don't understand something," says Neal Baer, a producer of ABC series "Descedent" about the secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers who, after the attack on the House of Congress, becomes the president.
Nell Scavell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Only funny parts and a few unpleasant truths like secret access to Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote for Short.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, "He makes me laugh," said Scavell.
The value of chaos is that it cheers.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the stories coming from Washington may determine the future of the Roe v Wade case, the ability to unite immigrant families and the state of the global economy.
Non-watching is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it's more than necessary to be an informed citizen when you realize that for six hours now you've been looking at a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward uses sensitive data for his book Fear, Paul Manafort demonstrates a $15,000-dollar ostrich leather jacket (“things in a haughty coat”, wrote The Washington Post) and the shocking description of Stormy Daniels Trump's anatomy.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario again.
"His actions remind you of the reality show, because every night he throws something away for you," says Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Pawn Stars, the creator of Short Show, about the changing characters and the daily twists of the story (the entanglement of the conflict with N.F.L. or the praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss any series, or you're gonna be late.
When I got in touch with Fleiss this week, outside of his house on the north coast of Kauai was 27 degrees warm and the sun shone, but he was inside and, recording CNN, he was watching MSNBC.
He could not open himself – it was not when Bretto Kavanaugh had a station before the Senate Court Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung on the hair.
“I remember when we once made those crazy shows, people said: “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization”, told Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

In the intense struggle of the mid-term elections to the House of Representatives, money is pouring from around
It is no wonder that the conversion of the congress districts, which ended with the attempt of two Members of the House of Representatives to win the same post, brought money to the 17th district of Pennsylvania.
The recently overdrafted suburban district of Pittsberg involved a Democrat Member of the House of Representatives, Conor Lamb, who won his place in a special election last spring in another county.
Lamb is in competition with another member of the House of Representatives, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th District of Pennsylvania. Much of it overlaps with the new 17th.
Maps were overwritten when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that in violation of the Constitution, the old districts were falsified for the benefit of Republicans.
During the election March in the new 17th district, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Congress Committee of the Democratic Campaign (DKK) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRKK) – clashes with regard to the campaign's finances.
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania when in the 18th Congress District a small majority won the widely watched special elections in March.
This place has been occupied by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Political experts have given democrats some advantage.
The U.S. discussed the punishment of El Salvador for its support to China but then calmed down
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, but have not generally received a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump took part in a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in this country before the partners removed the leadership of Trump Organization.
‘On the basis of recent decisions no longer recognised by the Taiwanese State Department, the officials decided to withdraw the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama’, stated the representative of the Department, Heather Nauert, in a report published earlier this month.
But sanctions are being considered only against El Salvador, who in 2017 received approximately USD 140 million of American aid, as well as drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial assistance and visa restrictions on specific individuals, would have been painful for a Central American country with high levels of unemployment and murder.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed the conference to a high level of security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward in preventing migrants entering the United States.
But in mid-September, the highest officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and thus virtually completed any consideration of the sanctions against El Salvador.
“In order to show the importance of the administration for this gathering, Vice-President Mike-Pence has now been included in the list of speakers for the conference to be held in mid-October,” said the diplomats.
On the other hand, three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without reporting any reprimands or punishments from Washington.
The representative of the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were shared by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an analyst who is close to the administration and who has also spoken if his anonymity is preserved.

The report of the Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Short's justice, which is now very strong evidence available in public archives, will inevitably continue to be awaited.
Furthermore, as we have seen, Mueller asks his investigation of whether the Trump campaign was not carried out secretly in cooperation with Russia, which was damaging to our elections.
If Congress were to change its hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution – at the same time as he is preparing to return to the electorate and perhaps finally to the Commission of Government.
There is a lot of "if" and I do not claim that the end of the Short is inevitable – as is its equivalent in Europe.
We will all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will determine whether the fight will continue for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler – only the West needed to resist him and support Czechoslovak in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to prevent the slaughter that took several years later.
The story is moving around such crucial turning points – then the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or paused.
Now the Americans are at some of these crucial turning points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the fate of Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein’s trouble began when this newspaper reported that last year the official had suggested that the president be secretly recorded and that he had considered his inadequacy.
Rosenstein says that the story of The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new investigation by the FBI into Bretto Kavanaugh proves to be incomplete or incorrect or if, despite convincing accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony, this candidate is to be appointed to the Supreme Court?
And finally, will we vote in favour of Congress in the mid-term elections, which will force Short to take responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy is threatened with a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we'll keep it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew and was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, once based in the home where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and after 60 years, I was sent to light Sabbath candles on a swastika table.
When I have such a legacy, how can I view our future sub-optimally?"

Graham Dorrants from Rangers' fight with Rapid Vienna awaits optimistically
On Thursday, Rangers will accept Rapid Vienna knowing that if after the impressive competition with Villarreal against the Austrians that took place in Spain earlier this month, they could find themselves in a strong position that would allow them to leave the G Group.
Because of the road trauma, the middle player Graham Dorrans could appear this season for the first time only in the 2:2 result of the competition with Villarreal. But he hopes that the Rangers club can use this result as a springboard towards more important goals.
“For us, this result was good because "Villarreal" is a great team,” said 31-year-old player.
“We started playing with the belief that we would achieve something, and we finished with something.
Perhaps at the end we could have been more accurate, but the competition was not bad at all.
They must've been better at the first quarter, and we've been on the second, and we've turned out to be a better team.
On Thursday, there will be another important European League evening.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be tough, because the result was great in the last competitions, but I have no doubt that with the support of the viewers we can get ahead and achieve a good result.
Last year was really hard – both what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope that we will now be able to move forward, forget about last season and play successfully."
Because of this fear of pension savings, a woman suffers from insomnia
Although the respondents clearly imagined the kind of care they would like to receive, few talked to family members about it.
About half of the Nationwide respondents said that they talked with the spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member, but do not try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide life insurance company.
That's where we need to start.
Talk to your spouse and children, and if you do not announce your wishes in advance, your family will not be prepared to take care of you.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and what kind of care you would like to receive, as these factors may be important for anticipating expenses.
Call a financial adviser, and the counselor can also help you to figure out how to pay for these expenses.
For long-term care, you can decide to pay for these costs by means of a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a combined money-value life insurance policy or by covering your assets as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents. Prevent legal disputes by providing security documents.
Develop a health authority: Appoint a reliable person to care for your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Think also about the authority to take care of your finances.
You should choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you become incapacitated.

Ilfrakume pneumatic rifle multiple shot
After spending the evening in town, the man who went home was shot with an air gun several times.
A 40 - year - old victim was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm in the Ilfracum Oxford Grauv district in Devon.
At about 02:30 a.m., officers described the shooting during the summer of England as an act of chance.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not threaten his life, and the police are asking witnesses for help.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
“At least 384 people died when on Friday a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the town of Palau, Indonesia,” said officials.
Because of the destroyed communications, the officials of the emergency services could not obtain any data from Dongala regenty, a place north of Palu, near the earthquake epicentre of 7.5 points.
In case of disaster, more than 16 000 people were evacuated from Palau.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, Palu, with a population of about 379 800, is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, founded on the narrow western end of the Gulf on the coast of the island of Sulawesi.
When the earthquake struck and the tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regent, stretching along the coast of over 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest of the Sulawesi Island.
In 2017, about 299 200 inhabitants lived in Regentiste, a smaller administrative region than the province.
Fishing and farming are the main economic pillars of the central province of Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The mining of nickel is also important in the province, and it is true that it is concentrated mainly on the coast of Morovale on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster relief agency, Palu and Dongala have been affected several times over the last century by tsunamis.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people in Dongala and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, the tsunami struck Dongal West in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia’s seismic - active circle of fire in the Pacific is constantly being hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On 26 December 2004, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami in northern Sumatra, which affected 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the Indian coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the nearby island of Nias.
In 2006, a 6.8-point earthquake struck the southern part of the island Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
In 2009, a 7.6-point earthquake struck the area close to Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
In 2010, a 7.5-point earthquake struck one of the Mentavai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami with waves of up to 10 metres, swept away tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
In 2016, Pidij jaja regenty in Aceh was devastated and panicked because people remembered how everything was devastated by the terrible earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the grieving buildings.
In 2018, severe earthquakes shocked Lombok, an island widely visited by Indonesian tourists, and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, while thousands of tourists temporarily stuck on the coast.
Saraha Palin’s eldest son in custody for allegations of domestic violence
Trac Palin, chief son of the former Governor of Alaska and vice president candidate Sarahos Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaskan police, 29-year-old Palin of Vasila, Aliaska, was arrested in the face of suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resistance to detention.
According to a police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took his phone away from her.
As reported by KTU, Palin was returned to the pre-trial detention facility in Mat-Su for a deposit of USD 500.
"On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he claimed to be absolutely innocent when he was asked to justify himself," reported the Network.
Palin is accused of three Class A offences, meaning that he can be imprisoned for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also accused of class B offences, punishing a day in prison and a fine of USD 2 000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported an alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan veteran court.
In January 2016, he was charged with attacks at home, obstruction of reporting the crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons while being sober.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups when she associated his son’s cruel behavior with post - traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after the tsunami that hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake caused a tsunami with a magnitude of 7.5 and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working, and the number of people killed is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central city of Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The social media share videos showing the moment of the tsunami’s shock.
The tsunami struck the coast when hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu.
The Federal Prosecutors seek the rarely applied death penalty for a New York terrorist suspect
In New York, the federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been committed in this state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is suspected that on October 31, 30-year-old Saipovas from Home Depot rented a truck and set up an attack on the bicycle path along the western highway in Lower Manhattan.
According to a report in the Southern District of New York on the intention to pursue the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious bodily injuries.
According to the court document, both of these indictments may lead to the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury, issued a 22-point indictment to Saipov, which included eight charges for the murder of property rapes (usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime), and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say that the attack was very well planned and premeditated, and the way Saipov executed it called it disgusting, cruel, and immoral.
"The actions of Sayfulll Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, victims and loss of loved ones to members and friends of the following families: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco," states the statement of intentions.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case, which required the death penalty, was dealt with in New York South County a decade ago.
Indicted Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time they were executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 against Julius and Ethele Rosenbergs, who were sentenced two years ago to conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Syppov, who came from Uzbekistan, did not regret his actions either immediately after the attack or several months later.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipovas revealed to the officials that he was inspired by videos from the Islamic State (ISIS) that he watched on his phone.
The police reported that he also asked to hang the Islamic state flag in the hospital ward.
He did not acknowledge his guilt under the 22nd line of charges.
David Patton, one of the federal state-funded defenders of Saipov, said that they were clearly disappointed with the decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to acknowledge guilt and to serve life without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events to all the persons concerned," said Patton.
The Saipov Defence Team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Torsian parliamentarian says that the Brexit negotiations must be carried out under the responsibility of NIGELAS FARAGEÑAS
Today, at the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage has promised to mobilise the nation’s army.
The former leader of UKIP said that politicians must feel the heat of the Eurosceptics, and one of the parliamentarians of Theresa May suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative House of Commons, said to the demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would now have left if Brexit had been Secretary of Farage.
But the difficulties that May faces in trying to unite the divided ranks of supporters have been revealed by the EU's protagonists, who joined the city's separate protest against Brexit.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement the compromise plan agreed in the Czech Republic when it is being attacked by Brexit's supporters, opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the hostile reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Boney said at the Leave Means Leave rally Solihalle that he wanted to ruin the Chekers' plan.
He argued that Farage was to be an equal partner and had to be given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had taken the lead, we would have left the EU already," he said.
A member of the Parliament of Velingboro added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Czechs' plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We fought in global wars not to obey others.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
★ Bone denied the suggestion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The notion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also participated in demonstrations and told journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Czechs' plan is unpopular among the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular among our party members and activists who are going to the streets and, above all, who are voting for us.
Drop the Chekers' plan and start listening."
In a critical report, May added: “Primers keep their positions when they keep their promises. ”
Farageæ said that mythical politicians should be forced to feel the heat if they issue a decision taken in a referendum in 2016.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the nation and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, so we're here today to tell them that we won't get away with it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which has almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing an army of the nation of this country that has brought us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-government and proud of the United Kingdom."
And the opponents of Brexit marched on the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
When the group was formed this weekend, a group of activists waved posters "Theors against Brexit".
Labour Lord Adonis has ridiculed the Conservatives for the security problems they have experienced as a result of the party app at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies needed for the Canada plus plus option, for walls without friction and free trade without borders with Ireland," he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider taking part in the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the November elections she would seriously consider taking part in the presidential election.
Boston Globe announced that the Masachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with the public on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who regularly criticises President Donald Trump, is taking part in the November re-elections, where he will compete with GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, one of the leaders of the 2016 Short Campaign Massachusetts.
It was speculated that it could compete with Short in 2020.
Since Trump became president, Saturday afternoon's event in Holjok was its 36th meeting with voters using the public meeting format.
One participant asked if she was planning to take part in the presidential election.
Warren replied that the time had come for women to go to Washington and repair a shattered government, and a woman must be in charge of this.
Arrested suspect in LSU Sims' shooting case
On Saturday, the police in the town of Louisiana, Baton Rouge, reported that they had arrested a suspect accused of shooting a LSU basketball player, Wayde-Sims, on Friday.
At a press conference at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dytheon Simpson, who was 20 years old, was arrested.
The police distributed the video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man that was seen there.
Twenty - year - old Sims was shot and died early on Friday near a South university town.
According to 247sports, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul reported to the media on Saturday that Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result of injuries.
Sayede, he stood up to defend his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to be at the scene of the crime, had a gun and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was not arrested and was arrested by the District Police Department of East Baton Rouge.
Sims, a 198 cm penultimate student, grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the last season, 10 of them started in five, spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the court, earned 5.6 points and regained 2.9 ball.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the world champion when the team instructed him to give victory to Sebastian Vettell
When Valtter Bott overcame Lewis Hamilton on Saturday qualifying ride, it became clear at once that the instructions of the Mercedes team in the race will be very important.
After starting the race from the first place, Bott started well and, defending his position in the first two turns, almost left him in Hamilton's trouble, encouraging Vettelis to attack his teammate.
Wettel first entered the two - sided garage, left Hamilton, and returned to the race in the tail of the group, so it was fatal.
Mercedes entered the two-armed garage after the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettelis, but Hamilton came forward after the actions that had just ended in contact, when Ferrari's driver, after a double maneuver, was reluctant to release the inner side of the track in order to keep his position in the third turn.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back of the formation, but at the end of the first wheel he was already on the seventh.
He was the fastest race, because he drove without changing the tires, to be as fast as possible in the finish, to overtake Kimi Riikkonen and finish the fourth.
At last, he entered the two-armed garage on the 44th wheel, but he was unable to increase the pace of the rest of the eight wheels, and Raikkonen crossed the fourth line of the finish line.
“Wallther had a hard day because he had a great weekend, and when he was asked to miss me, he acted like a gentleman.
The team worked well and won the first two places," said Hamilton.
It was really poor body language
President Donald Trump spoke to Senator Dianne Feinstein during a meeting with the people on Saturday about her persistent denial of the leaking letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brettus Kavanaugh is accused of sexual rape.
In his speech in West Virginia, the President did not directly name the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Legal Committee, but said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were wicked, indecent and unjust.
"What may have happened and actually happens in recent days in the Senate, when you see anger when you see that people are evil, wicked, indecent and unjust," he said.
“When you see official statements and leaks, and then you say, “Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer to the question, Did she leak the document? “Oh, oh, oh, what?
Not at all.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added, depicting the senator.
As early as July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford’s accusations against Kavanaughui, which had been leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein said to the Committee: "I did not conceal Dr. Ford's accusations and I did not leak her history."
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I did it as she asked."
However, the president did not seem to agree with her denial, and during the meeting with the people on Saturday evening, he said: “You know, this was a really bad language of the body.
It may not have leaked, but it was the worst language I've ever seen in the body."
The President continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court judges, who was accused of illegal sexual behaviour by three women, by claiming that the democrats had used the charges for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power by any appropriate means.
You see humiliation and indecentness; they don't care what they hurt or who they have to cross to get power and control," quoted the President's speech, "Media".
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer won two goals in a match with Dandi Club Giants
Dundee Stars recovered for the loss of Friday's elite league in Belfast's Giants and won Saturday's retaliation game at Dandi's score of 5:3.
The Giants came forward early when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier won two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were even before Dwyer took the Giants forward again.
Francois Bouchards from the Dandi team smoothed the score, but later two of Lukas Lundwald Nielsen's goals won.
The men of Adam Keefeæ have suffered the third defeat this season in the elite league, after catching up with Dandi club in Belfast on Friday night with a 2:1 result.
This was the fourth team meeting this season, three previous matches won by Giants.
Dwyer scored his first goal for the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendall McFaull's transfer, and after four more minutes, Beauvillier doubled his weight after David Rutherford's transfer.
In a difficult game, Sullivan returned the owners of the Arena to the game, earning the goal at 13:10 and after the transfer of Matt Marquardto, Cownie evened the result at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants went to the first break in the lead, and at the end of the first quarter he earned his second goal of the evening.
Having a quantitative advantage, the owners of the square regrouped and Bouchard again leveled the result at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen for the first time in the game Dandi's team to break ahead at the end of the second quarter, and established the victory by winning the fifth goal of the team in the middle of the last quarter.
Giants, who have already lost the last four matches of five, will meet Milton Keynes at home next Friday.
The air traffic controller died to help hundreds of air passengers escape from the earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero when he died by helping an aircraft with several hundred passengers to safely take off into the air.
More than 800 people died, and many are considered missing after Friday’s violent earthquake that caused the tsunami on the island of Sulawesi.
The area continues to be shaken by strong repeated underground shocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palau.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly fluctuating control tower of Palu, Mutiaros Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He remained at his place of work to help the 6321 Batik Air aircraft that had to fly on flight, which was already on the runway, to take off safely.
Then, thinking that the control tower was falling, he jumped out of it.
Later he died in the hospital.
According to Australia’s ABC News, Indonesia’s air navigation representative Yohannes Sirait said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We flew him to a larger hospital in another city with a helicopter from Balikpapan in California.
Sadly, this morning we lost him before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is a very painful message for us," he added.
On the other hand, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to thousands, since the country’s disaster relief agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Siggie, and Boutong are hard to reach.
"It is expected that the number of victims will increase as many victims are still under the rubble and cannot be reached", said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palau was devastated by a wave up to 30 feet [6 m] high, where a mass funeral will be arranged on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said Sky News: "Every minute ambulances bring victims.
There is a lack of clean water.
Self-service stores are being robbed everywhere."
Janis Gelfand CNN, leader of the International Red Cross of Indonesia, said: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation may get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Yoko Widodos arrived in Palu and approached the country’s army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all your evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" Reported CNN.
Earlier this year, the Indonesian earthquakes in Lombok caused more than 550 deaths.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Newgini now says that when the plane falls into the lagoon, one person is missing
The airline that operated the flight, which ended in an aircraft crash in the Micronesia Pacific lagoon, now says that one person is missing, even though he said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking plane.
In the report Air Newgini said that they do not know about a man on Saturday afternoon.
The airlines indicated that they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals, and researchers in their search for a man.
Airlines have not responded immediately to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water to try to land at Chuck Island Airport.
The officials reported on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airlines said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, all in a stable state.
The causes of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain uncertain.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses believe that the plane has missed landing.
The American passenger Bill Yaynes said that the plane fell from a very low point of view.
"It was very good," said Yaynes.
Yaynes told us that in a sinking plane flooded to the waist, he and others were able to get to emergency exits.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, and he himself suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that their sailors who repaired the nearby marina also helped rescue people who were transported by inflatable boat to shore before the plane sunk to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, during the last two decades 111 people have died in the accidents of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them were owned by Air Newgini.
An analyst set out the sequence of events in the night when the woman was burned alive
The Public Prosecutor's Office stated the facts at the repeat case of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, has witnessed for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to connect the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims of Jessica Chambers on the night of death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Telllis was with Chamber on her death night, which contradicted previous statements.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with a friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Telly was telling the truth, claiming that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he “did not lie because his truck was in Nashil. ”
Another difference was that Telly said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Mobile phone records show they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Telley deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
It is planned that defence will begin to teach its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge thought that the case would be passed on to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: Who is a conscious hiphop?
The Hiphop Trio wants to change the negative attitude towards this genre by spreading positive messages in its music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hiphop has moved away from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to return to the source of the hiphop and once again popularize the conscious hiphop.
Performers such as The Fugees and Common have recently reborn in UK performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?!
New York's nanny sued a couple after being dismissed because of a "racist" message
New York's nanny brought a couple to court for dismissal on grounds of discrimination after receiving a false address message from a mother complaining that she was "another black woman".
The couple denies being racist and called the claim "rape".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was upset to learn that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, is black when she arrived on the first working day of 2016.
"NEEEEEEE, ONE LARGE," Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a message.
However, she was sent twice not to her husband, but to Mr Maurice.
According to New York Post, he understood that Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and fired from work, saying that the former nanny, who was African-American, had done his job badly and expected to receive a Filipino instead.
Mr Maurice was paid for one working day and she was sent home by Uber.
Maurice now sued the couple in order to claim compensation for dismissal and seeks to claim even USD 350 a day for half a year's life and work at the client's home, for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things cannot be done," she said, "Post on Friday, adding: "I know that this is discrimination".
The couple retaliated to the accusations of racism by denying this and claiming that Maurice’s dismissal from work was reasonable because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after she had been insulted.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," the husband Joel Plastz said, "Post".
“Would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I don't think so."
Plastz, who equated the claim with rape, said that his wife had a baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to judge this?
This is not very nice behavior," added an investment banking specialist.
While the trial was being conducted, the media rushed to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not understand the talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to feel like someone else reading the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's enormous success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before finding inspiration to write a book for kids about a teddy bear, would not have been too upset if his job had been rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book after the death of his father was pleasant and sad.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that the father was silently proud of his success.
"He was quite calm and disliked to brag," she said.
“Because Paddington was so similar to him himself, he felt like he had a child who achieved something: you are proud of him, even though it is not really your job.
I think he's similarly appreciated Paddington's success story.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to the hospital of Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Nadas has always called and said that the condition is really bad, it is not expected to survive," Mr. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I received a call from Nad who called to say that she had two minutes to live and had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I told her: “Tashi, my dear, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medications given by doctors that maintained her heart beat slowly stopped working and disappeared from the body.
She died a little earlier and it was the end of everything.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry, because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it in me."
Finally, Mr Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving his dead daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who did not understand the difficult test she had to face.
"No one knew," she said.
“My head was lowered and tears were always falling.
It's hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt great pity for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards for women who mourn to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones in death are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys distribute postcards on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and call for help.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he got depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any father to feel the way I have to feel every day," she said.
Mr. Davis, who lives in Lydney, 45 years old, said that her son was a promising chef with an infective smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always used to say that his smile sheds light on the room."
But he quit before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his suicide brother.
Mr Davis said: "I am constantly afraid that a chain reaction may occur."
Davis created postcards “so that people know that there are people around who can be contacted and talked to, even if they are a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk."
Mr Humphreys, a long-time friend of Mr. Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner, Mark, who left his life shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he felt depressed, depressed and did not complain about anything," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his changed attitude.
The situation was quite bad at Christmas: when the children unwinded their gifts, he did not look in their eyes and did not react."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: “In the family it has left a emptiness.
It's tearing our heart.
But we all have to live on and fight."

At the beginning of the investigation by the FBI, Bretto Kavanagh’s future fell on the hair
I thought that if we could really get something that he asked for – a limited time and scope study – we might bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was "beating" in the strong grips of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their opposition is determined solely by time.
There are only five weeks left until the mid-term elections, which will take place on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected to turn out badly, their efforts to elect the desired person to the highest court in the country will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley, former personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 republican and 49 democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can receive 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to terminate the contacts and approve him to the Supreme Court.
When Kim came to power, the number of North Korean deserters "diminished"
The South Korean legislator said that the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea fell when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-Seug, quoting figures from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said that 1 127 deserters were identified last year, compared with 2 706 deserters in 2011.
Mr Park said that the main factors were the tightening of North Korea's and China's border controls and the increase in the cost of smuggling people.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
Many North Korean deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30 000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and they are often forced to return to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war technically, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang in negotiations, where the negotiations on the nuclear phase-out were blocked in the centre.
This took place after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when both agreed in principle to make the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-free zone.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of not having changed their sanctions since then.
"If there is no trust in the US, we will not be able to rely on our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm the first," said Mr Ri at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Bretta Kavanaugh calls him "hysterical" and says that he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, called the candidate for the Supreme Court judges Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve at the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
N. Pelosi made these comments during an interview made on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I simply cannot think that if a woman did, she would be said to be hysterical," Mr Pelosi expressed his reaction to the testimony given by Mr Kavanaugh on Thursday to the Senate Court Committee.
Mr Kavanaugh has emotionally denied the accusation of sexual abuse against Dr Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, when he spoke about the family and high school times, Mr Kavanagh was very emotional, sometimes crying or crying.
He also completely condemned the democrats in the committee, who were accused of calling him "the great and coordinated destruction of his reputation", which was supposedly organised by the liberals, who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believed that the testimony given by Mr Kavanaugh proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he had revealed his biased attitude towards democrats.
"I believe that he disqualified himself with his statements and with the attack on the Clinton and Democratic Party," she said.
When asked whether it would seek to remove Mr Kavanaugh if his candidacy had been approved and the democrats had received a majority in the House of Representatives, Mr Pelosi objected.
"I will say this: if he lies to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to perform his duties not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said N. Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal of Colombia.
Mr Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Mr Kavanaugh on the Accessibility of Health Law or in the case of Roe v Wade, because he was considered to be a conservative judge.
During the approval sitting, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be revoked.
"This is not the time for us to say, "How wonderful!" – said N. Pelosi.
The power that women should exercise
This is a legitimate criticism – the anger that has been accumulated for months and even years, which it cannot express without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," Miss Steinem told me in 45 years.
"It doesn't seem unusual to me, but to you?"
She added: “I was very helped by a woman, a manager of a company, who said that she too was crying when she was angry, but she developed a certain method: when she was angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to at the time: “You may feel sad because I cry.
I'm really angry."
And she just kept crying.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are regarded as acceptable expressions of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories is from one of my first jobs in the office, where most of the men worked, and where I once cried because of unspeakable rage. Then I was picked up by an older woman behind the carrot, a harsh leader, who was always a little afraid, and dragged to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said to me.
- They don't know you're pissed off.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to beat you."
A member of the Congress of the Democratic Party from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in adultery on the Monkey Business and withdrew his candidacy, Mr Schroeder was deeply disappointed that there was no reason why he could not stand for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” she laughed after 30 years.
- There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for another one.
Someone called me "Snow with seven Dwarves."
When the campaign began late, there was little time left to raise funds, so she swore that she would not announce a candidate until she had collected $2 million.
It was a rough fight.
She noticed that some of the supporters who donated $1,000 to men were spending only $250 on her.
"Perhaps they thought I was getting a discount?" she wondered.
In a speech in which she announced that she was launching a formal campaign, she was so emotionally involved with the people who supported her gratitude, a system of disappointment that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and directly reach voters, not representatives, and anger about sexism, that she cried.
“You would have thought that I had nerves,” recalled Mr. Schroeder’s press reaction to her speech.
- You would have thought that I was supported by Kleenex's napkin business.
I remember thinking about what's going to be written in my grave monument.
"She was crying?"
How the US and China can benefit Beijing
The first island in the U.S.-China trade war was deafened, and although the battle is far from over, experts say that strife can eventually be beneficial to Beijing.
US President Donald Trump gave the first warning this year by charging the main Chinese exports a little earlier, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most serious resistance occurred this week, when the new tariffs came into force, which will affect goods worth 200 billion dollars (GBP 150 billion), i.e. half of China's exports to the US will in principle be taxed.
Beijing responded in the same way, with the latest decision imposing a five to ten percent duty on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has vowed to fight the U.S. teeth for a tooth, and it seems that this second largest world market is definitely not going to land in the near future.
Washington would only relax sanctions if China complied with the demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing is to play its party properly, the difficulties of the trade war with the US can eventually have a positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of these markets.
"The fact that an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that could lead to economic disruption in both countries is indeed much more dangerous than the observers have so far recognised," said Abigail Grace, an employee of the scientific institute Asia New American Security Centre.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to receive return refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for assistance in rebuilding a country that has been devastated for more than 7 years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walidas al-Moualem, said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Progress in the fight against terrorism has made the situation in the territory much more stable and secure," he said.
The authorities continue their efforts to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists and restore normal conditions.
The conditions have already been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have left behind as a result of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against everyday life and prosperity.
According to UN estimates, since the beginning of the war in 2011, Syria has been abandoned by some 5.5 million Syrians.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid for rebuilding the affected country.
However, he also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe marked the victory of the "Ryder" Cup in Paris
The European team, which overcame the US team with the final result 16,5:10.5, won the "Ryder" Cup in 2018 in the Le Golf National Square near Paris (France).
For the sixth time in a row, the USA has lost in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup on this continent since 1993.
Europe took back the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team collected 14.5 points, which were enough to defeat the United States.
The US star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time during the tournament, had a blow from the launch site straight into the water at the 16th hole in the 3rd day match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player, F. Molinari, lit in all rounds and became one of the four players who achieved a score of 5-0-0 since the tournament gained its present form in 1979.
American Jordan Siethe 5:4 was defeated by the lowest ranking European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson 2:1 defeated Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, the veteran of the eight Ryder Cup tournaments, became the most successful European player of all time in this tournament, having gathered 25.5 career points.
“I don’t cry very often, but I can’t control myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy to have the cup back.
It all depends on the team, and I am glad that I could help," said S. Garcia in his emotions after the victory of Europeans.
He gives the baton to his compatriot John Rams, who beat the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in Sunday's 2:1 game.
"I'm unbelievably proud of winning Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play," Rahm, aged 23, said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now he owns the 13-21-3 "Ryder" Cup career record.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, winning 14 biggest prizes and landing only for Jack Nicsk.
The U.S. team failed to hit the lawn all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finn, who demonstrated a high-level game throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furykas said after a disappointing team show: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, there was a moment when we started to put pressure on Europeans.
We're fighting.
I'm going up the hat against Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Reeder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm gonna bend my head down.
Our opponents were superior."
