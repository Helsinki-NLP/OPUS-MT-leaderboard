Thousands of crowds panic as barrier collapses in Central Park
Thousands of people, panicked by possible shots at a political event, ran away in Central Park after a police barrier collapsed.
Prominent personalities - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo representing the Democratic Party, Republican Senator Jeff Flake, Janeta Jackson, and John Legend - have called on viewers to engage in turbulent politics in the country.
As the barrier fell at an event on Saturday night, authorities quickly assured viewers that they were safe.
The event, which began on a sunny afternoon, focused on social justice.
An estimated 60,000 observers gathered for the Great Meadow's Universal Citizen Festival, where Cardi B, The Weeknd and other pop stars were to appear.
Some of the speakers asked the audience to call the members of Congress representing them and give their opinion on the Senate hearings this week on the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
Uninterrupted series of Alastair Seeley victories at British Supersport race in Assen
Alastair Seeley retained his winning position in the British Supersports race
Alastair Seeley won his third win in five British Supersport races, defeating Saturday in a 12-round sprint in the Dutch city of Assen.
A racer from Karikfergus overtook Yamaha driving Jack Kennedy by 0.05 seconds.
The 38-year-old winner also triumphed at Silverstone and Oulton Park this month.
Seeley represents Northern Ireland team EHA Racing, with which he has already won the North West 200 international race in May.
The former British champion competed the entire race with Kennedy and, despite all the efforts of the double, he failed to outperform a rival from Northern Ireland.
Seeley teammate David Allingham remained seventh in Saturday's Supersport race.
Scott Swann finished the British Talent Cup race eighth.
Glenn Irwin, driving "Be Wiser Ducati", trying to rise above the current fourth place in the championship rankings, was fourth in two qualifying runs of the Sunday British Superbike race.
This week, it was announced that Irwin would move to JG Speedfit Kawasaki for the 2019 season.
Michael Laverty of Toome, driving a Tyco BMW, was ranked 13th, while Andrew Irwin and his PBM Ducati were ranked 14th.
Why Do Hong Kong Home Workers Learn Dance Movements?
About 300,000 foreigners work as domestic workers in Hong Kong.
They are required by law to live in the employers' homes.
These workers work six days a week, up to 18 hours a day, for a small reward.
This story is about Mhelanie, who dedicates her only day off to community events that help to break away from her isolating work routine.
Donuts salesman Lin Ognissanti will be honored by Bedford Mayor
In the photo: Lina Ognissanti sells ice cream during the warm season and donuts in the winter.
A woman who has been selling donuts and ice cream in the city centre for more than 40 years will be honored with a private reception for the mayor.
Lina Ognissanti, who trades ice cream and donuts on the kiosk "Dinky Donuts" on Bedford's Midland Road, was invited with her family by an afternoon tea party.
Nearly 3,000 people have signed a petition online to have it awarded or received recognition.
Mr. Ognissanti said that she was honored to receive such praise.
According to Bedford Mayor Dave Hodgson, Mr. Ognissanti and his children and grandchildren were invited to his office to inspect the city's regalia and historical artifacts and drink afternoon tea.
"Lina Bedforfe occupies a special place and her kiosk is part of the city centre," he said.
I'm glad she accepted my invitation, and look forward to meeting us in my office so I can thank Lina for her work in our city."
Mr. Ognissanti thanked, in her words, the "pleasing" Bedford residents who thought of her, and said, "This is a great honour and a beautiful deed."
Sarkab Mahmood, who filed the petition, said he did not expect to receive as many signatures.
Upon hearing of the reception, scheduled to be held by the end of the year, he said: "I'm very happy for Lina because she deserves it for her excellent character."
On the road with Alster's Lambretta Club
The "Lambretta" scooters were indispensable satellites of the 1960s mod culture.
A group of Italian scooter fans try to preserve the spirit of those times.
70 years after the founding of Alster's first Lambretta club, approximately 100 amateur scooters from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered in Fermana County this weekend.
One of the two members of the first club, Chris Wilson, purchased the first Lambretta in 1966 for around 40 pounds.
"For me, the scooter was just a vehicle, but I found out I could use it in a different way.
It was such a sport.
I didn't get into mod culture, and now I'm probably too old for that," he said.
"It was quite cheap and quite reliable, you could buy it at an affordable price, and when you bought it you could do something more than just drive from point A to point B."
He would take part in the Lambretta separate start race at the Isle of Man TT Ring.
The first club in Alster's Lambretta was founded in the early 1970s and redesigned 12 years ago.
"About 1971, scooters and other forms of transportation were becoming less and less interested in people, and clubs were generally affected by the unrest, so I thought, 'It's all, it's the end,'" Chris said.
"Then at some point there was renewed interest and it seems to have grown more and more."
Philip Steele is the secretary for memberships of the Alster Lambretta Club, which currently has 97 members.
"Everybody's motives are different.
Some members were influenced by the mod culture, as it almost all started with it.
Others are racing enthusiasts or rockers - here you will find all kinds of people.
There are also some who are simply interested in vintage.
Many scooters are modified, so two are not the same.
It is possible not to change the scooter and to ride calmly at a speed of 35 or 40 miles per hour, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved on this.
Some significantly modified scooters could probably reach speeds of up to 100 miles per hour."
During the weekend, there were failures, some scooters had to be started by pushing.
And while the weather in Northern Ireland isn't always as pleasant as that of Lambretta's homeland Italy, this time the scooters in Fermana County were shone by the sun.
Ruth Davidson asks Tory for silence on Brexit
Ruth Davidson asked her Conservative colleagues for a "period of silence" so that the prime minister could agree on a Brexit.
The Scottish Tory head said there was enough time for debate within two years of the EU referendum.
She voiced her opinion after Boris Johnson's words about the Prime Minister's plan, which he called "crazy and completely absurd".
She told the BBC show Sunday Politics Scotland that it was time to support the Prime Minister.
At a party conference in Birmingham that gathered Tory activists, she said: "We've had time for a debate in the last two years.
The former foreign secretary served in one of the best offices in the country's history and most of the current plan, already recognized in November of last year, was prepared during that period.
The Conservatives now have to support the Prime Minister, allow her to complete the deal and help implement the plans in the country.
I think a period of silence would be very useful."
Her comments followed sharp criticism in the Brexit debate, which was not first expressed by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro's programme, Theresa May later assured her that she believed in Brexit and that her cabinet plan could secure a favorable free trade deal with the European Union.
Mr. Davidson also said that by running in the next election he would pledge to prevent Scotland's second independence referendum, as in 2014 "the Scots were promised that such an event would be the only one in their generation".
When asked about a possible re-run referendum on Brexit, she replied: "If we are talking about Scottish history, I have repeatedly stated that you cannot repeat a referendum if you are a nationalist and the result does not satisfy you.
I would be more hypocritical if I said that another referendum on Brexit could be held because I expected a different outcome."
Road M8 reopened after police incident
Highway M8 reopened after a police incident at Glasgow.
According to police, the road was closed in both directions at the 15 Townhead intersection just before 07.00 a.m. due to concerns about a pedestrian.
Traffic on the closed road did not go for three hours and was disrupted in the city where the marathon Great Scottish Run takes place.
A 20-year-old man was later taken to Glasgow Royal Hospital for research.
Christine'a Blasey Ford's friend confirmed a statement on sexual abuse alleged by Brett Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was friends in high school with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse when they were both teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee and explained that although she herself does not remember the party at the house where the attack may have taken place, she believes Ford's story.
Keyser previously issued a statement through his lawyer that he did not remember the party mentioned above and did not even know if he had met Kavanaugh.
While testifying before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Kavanaugh often referred to Keyser's statement as evidence of his innocence, but did not mention Keyser's claim that she believed Ford's words.
President Trump on Friday ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation within a week when Republican Senator Jeff Flake and other moderate senators asked to give time to the investigation and delay the vote of the entire Senate on Kavanaugh for a week.
Keyser sent a letter to the committee through his lawyer on Saturday saying he wanted to "contribute as much as possible to an additional FBI investigation" into Kavanaugh.
"However, as my client has already explained, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and does not remember a party or gathering in which he would have been with or without Dr Ford," Keyser's lawyer, Howard Walsh, wrote in a letter.
The letter further explains that Keyser "does not reject Dr. Ford's account and has already told the press that he believes Dr. Ford's testimony."
"The simplest and indispensable truth, however, is that it cannot confirm it because it does not remember the above-mentioned event," the letter continues.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, who was allegedly nearby during the attack, said he would also contribute to the FBI investigation.
Illegally convicted Chicago residents tell of life with a corrupt policeman and his gang
The chief Illinois prosecutor is trying to change the history of the Chicago police after a dark period.
It is believed that an unscrupulous policeman exploited innocent residents of social housing and unjustifiably arrested numerous people.
To date, 42 people have been acquitted illegally.
The social housing project site of the Ida B. Wells project currently has only an empty lot left, and in the past their residents have been almost unafraidly exploited by corrupt Chicago policemen for over a decade.
They were led by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
Residents accused him and his tactical squad of extortion, falsification and coercion of police reports and evidence.
Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those convicts who have so far been acquitted by Cook County Attorney General Kim Foxx.
"If you didn't work with him, you would end up badly.
You were his enemy.
You prevented him from acting and profiting," Cleon Glover said of Watts.
"I was very afraid.
I wanted to escape from that neighborhood,
but I had nowhere to go," said Willie Martin.
Lawyers from Foxx's ethics department are reviewing 30 to 40 more Watts-related cases.
Landon Allen, a social housing resident of Ida B. Wells, said that many people chose not to remain silent about Watts.
"A lot didn't keep up," he said.
"But it didn't matter."
According to another former resident, Clarissa Baker, no one believed the residents' words about the sergeant in office.
"He has his own gang.
Who will believe in us?"
said Baker.
Joshua Tepfer, who works on the University of Chicago acquittal project, says that so far no one has really believed them.
"It all took a while because they didn't seem to care about these people because they were black people living in social housing, so it was thought that they were committing something anyway," Tepfer said.
"Sergeant Watts was jailed for 22 months in 2013 for trying to rob an FBI informant.
Martez Wise is also jailed thanks to Watts.
I had just had a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He hardly knew me because he was just born, so I had to reconnect with him," Wise said.
"I lost four years unnecessarily."
For 72 years, Fidelity has believed in the success of blockchains, virtual reality and artificial intelligence.
Fidelity noticed the potential of blockchains as early as 2018, when all corporations began talking about the technology.
CEO Abby Johnson has led investments in cryptocurrencies, the most risky and volatile asset class in recent years.
"About two years ago, I and other senior executives were just curious about what was going on, especially in the bitcoin market," Johnson said.
We started talking and we realized we had to figure it out.
Curiosity led to the start of "mining" bitcoins in the New Hampshire division, when the price of this cryptocurrency was around $180.
In December last year, the price was close to $20,000 and, Johnson said, "we were surprised: as the price rose we started earning, although we never expected it."
She did not specify how many bitcoins had been "excavated" or how much had been earned by Fidelity.
Fidelity employees have a clear interest in these technologies.
The Block Chain Club, named "Bites and Blocks" for employees, which organizes seminars and meetings with professionals, now has approximately 2,600 members.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave Fidelity customers the ability to check the balance of cryptocurrencies using the Fidelity mobile app.
In 2015, opportunities were made to donate funds in bitcoins.
Johnson said the company had rejected most of the other possible uses of bitcoins, or at least abandoned them for a short time.
We're trying to keep an eye on the market.
And for now, Katie Chase, chief strategist at Fidelity's Center for Applied Technology and head of the Block Chain Incubator (which is part of FCAT), is looking at ways to harness the public and business blockchains used.
Chase was unable to comment on specific projects, but revealed that he had attracted great interest from customers, partners and employees.
"Everything is still very new.
If you delve into the information, you will realize that there is still an attempt to find evidence of the concept," Chase said.
We tried to adapt block chains to different situations and learned a lot, but the technology is not yet so advanced that it could solve such problems."
So far, she says, the group is focusing more on trying to understand the nature of those barriers.
They try to understand how to calculate the value of physical objects, such as works of art, in tokens or to use block chains in the supply chain.
"So far this is not the focus, but I think it will eventually attract interest," Chase said.
Fidelity will be ready for that."
As an example, she referred to the Pebble watch, which was completely unsuccessful in trading standards, but eventually paid off by Fidelity.
Her group developed the app for the smartwatch, which stopped production three years later, collecting millions through the Kickstarter crowdfunding project.
With Apple Watch on the market, Fidelity was ready.
It quickly adapted the Pebble app for the new Apple product.
"We weren't blindly convinced that the Pebble watch would become popular, but we wanted to be prepared if people liked smart watches," she said.
"We gained knowledge and were ready when the smartwatches were put on the mass market."
Sulawesi Island was devastated by an earthquake and tsunami
On Friday, September 29, a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, causing a tsunami and killing nearly 400 people.
There are numerous wounded and the number of dead is expected to grow.
According to a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency, electricity and communication are not working, making it difficult to assess the damage in Palu and the nearby fishing community of Dongala.
California students wore T-shirts with racist inscriptions
According to CNN affiliate KGTV, the Escondido School Union confirmed this week that about 10 students made the ill-conceived decision to demonstrate racism at a class-leading event.
"We are proud to welcome everyone in our school and not afraid of diversity," director Adriana Lepe-Ramirez said in a statement.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and exclusion."
The report also indicated that Escondido High School, union officials and local police were investigating the incident.
"School administrators have contacted the parents and guardians of the offending students and there will be disciplinary penalties," the report said.
According to a police station report, students at a school north of San Diego wore T-shirts with letters that literally put a racist inscription on them and were photographed wearing them during a picnic for the senior classes.
The school usually confirms the notes in advance, but after taking an official photo, some students choose their own words.
The Union report said that such behavior was "inconsistent with the culture, values, or history of Escondido High School."
"We need to be aware of the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day," Lepe-Ramirez said.
"Escondido High School will continue to foster a culture based on family values and unity throughout the community."
Former student Cade Pannell told KGTV that an offensive photo seen on social media angered him.
"It personally offended me," he said.
"Maybe it seemed funny to them, but it's not.
Only the ignorant can laugh at such things."
Shaquille O'Neal's son Shareef, who is awaiting heart surgery, will miss UCLA's 1st season
Shaquille O'Neal's son Shareef, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, will have to miss the first season of UCLA due to a heart condition.
According to TMZ Sports, O'Neal will undergo heart surgery to correct a disorder that UCLA doctors noticed during a routine examination.
"Thank God, UCLA medics noticed the problem early on," O'Neal told TMZ.
"As long as there is rehabilitation, I will attend lectures and be a normal student.
I'll be back very soon."
O'Neal signed an official intent protocol in August, promising to play for UCLA, which has already attracted a number of famous surnames and is one of the best freshmen teams in the country for the 2018-2019 season.
"Shareef has improved significantly in high school," Bruins head coach Steve Alford told reporters last month.
"He is tall, he has skills, he is athletic and he will be a great member of the new team.
We are delighted with the composition of this year's team and Shareef will complement it perfectly.
He has a good base and will be able to improve at both ends of the pitch."
According to 247Sports, 18-year-old O'Neal is a 4-star candidate, ranking 8th in the 2018 rookie rankings as a heavy fielder and 41st as a player.
Before joining UCLA, O'Neal helped Crossroads high school reach a record 25:9 in the final season.
Sarah Palin's eldest son accused of violence against father
Track Palin, 28, was arrested for three misdemeanors, including assault.
On Sunday, he was not arrested for domestic violence for the first time.
According to court records, the incident occurred at Palin's home in Vasilla, Alaska, where Track Palin injured his father Todd to the point of blood in a truck dispute.
The 28-year-old was arrested after Saturday's incident on three counts of misconduct, including assault.
Court documents indicate that the dispute began when a man called to pick up a truck, but his father refused to give it up.
As explained in the court statement, Track Palin was arrested on charges of first-degree burglary and fourth-degree assault and fourth-degree misdemeanor, and his father was wounded in the face and head.
According to the documents, Palin called the policemen who spoke to him "poor" and ordered him not to use weapons.
A court statement also indicated that the man had climbed onto the roof of the garage before being arrested.
The court documents record words by Sarah Palin that her son was "excited" and "used some medicine".
It has also been recorded that Track Palin told police that he had drunk several bottles of beer in the past.
He was arrested in early 2016 and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and possession of a gun while intoxicated.
"Seeing how my son feels, what he experiences when he comes back, I understand the other families going through the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, and I know how wounded the soldiers are going back," said the former Republican vice presidential candidate and governor of Alaska.
"Now I understand better than ever that America's best ones need a commander-in-chief who will respect and appreciate them."
Elizabeth Warren says she will think about running for president after midterm elections
"It's time for women to march to Washington D.C. and fix a broken government that a woman must lead," the Democratic senator told a crowd gathered outside the Massachusetts city hall of Holjok.
"So I promise this: after November 6, think carefully about whether it's not worth running for president."
Warren, who is trying to defend her position in a contest with Republican Representative Geoff Diehl in the state, has previously said that she will not stand for president because she wants to focus on working in the Senate.
"It's very important to focus on the midterm elections and stop acting as if the only thing that matters is 2020," she told reporters in an August speech at the National Press Club.
"The closest major struggle is the midterm elections, and they are important not only in Massachusetts, but across the country."
Warren has long been considered a potential 2020 Democratic candidate to compete with President Donald Trump.
However, they would face a tough primary election battle that could involve other prominent Democrats, former Vice President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris, and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
Celebrity mental health clinic linked to third enigmatic death in less than a year
According to The Mail, a third person has committed suicide in a luxury psychiatric clinic within a year.
The daughter of a television comedian, Shaquelle Vidal (23 years old), died on 7 April after spending almost a month voluntarily in West London, Marylebone, located at Nightingale Hospital.
Her boyfriend James Lyle, 57, a hedge fund manager, millionaire and former Conservative Party supporter, paid her maintenance expenses for five years.
The future head chef died almost six months after the day that celebrity Daisy Boyd, 28, a granddaughter of Rose Gray, one of the founders of River Cafe, died.
After parting with Dan Macmillan, 43, an heir to a publishing company, Mr Boyd died on October 5 under the influence of cocaine smuggled by a clinic visitor.
Two months ago, film court artist Alan MacDonald, 61, retired from his life when four days had passed since his release from the hospital.
In May, the Care Quality Commission criticized Nightingale's clinic for not doing enough to prevent the introduction of illegal substances.
The daughter of the BBC show "Mock The Week" comedian Ava Vidal, Shaquelle registered at the clinic on March 11.
In a preliminary hearing at Westminster coroner's court last week, royal attorney Katie Gollop said Shaquelle disappeared from AWOL on March 29 and returned in a deteriorated mental state a week later.
Mr. Gollop, acting on behalf of Ava Vidal, said: "My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquelle , who she was communicating with and what she was doing."
She referred to Mr. Lyle as Shaquelle's "boyfriend".
John Gordillo, 52, a comedy director called Shaquelle's unofficial stepfather, said: "I know Shaquelle continued to associate with James Lyle and he was in New York at the time."
Mr. Gordillo revealed at the hearing that Shaquelle called him on April 4 and said he wanted to buy and drink cyanide and he called the clinic "more than a dozen times" 20 minutes after this call, but no one responded.
"It seems to me that further events could have been avoided if someone had responded," he added.
On April 5, the clinic doctor found Shaquelle's mental condition to be extremely poor."
Less than 48 hours later, she hanged herself on a laptop wire.
A spokesman for Nightingale expressed his condolences to family and friends and said, "The goal of our clinic is to provide high-quality care in a safe, therapy-friendly environment."

Led Zeppelin is back in court over alleged stolen Stairway To Heaven guitar riff
Led Zeppelin was again sued for the use of a guitar riff in the 1971 song "Stairway To Heaven", which the band allegedly stole.
Some of the British band's 1971 hit is claimed to be plagiarized.
The Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 verdict that the group did not copy another group called "Spirit".
The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by Michael Skidmore, a trustee of the Spirit guitarist.
The litigation for the Led Zeppelin song "Stairway To Heaven" seems to last a long time - as does the song itself.
The band will face trial again on charges of stealing the 1971 ballad's guitar riff.
The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2016 that the band did not copy the start of the hit from the music of the band Spirit.
A court judge is said to have made mistakes, such as misrepresenting jurors about copyright laws.
The case was returned to the court.
Spirit guitarist Randy Wolfe's trustee Michael Skidmore filed his first lawsuit in 2015.
Police chase in Michigan ended when a policeman drove a suspected murderer who was shooting at them
A Michigan resident suspected of murdering his girlfriend was arrested after a police chase that ended with him crossing a police car.
Adam Nolin, 33, is suspected of shooting his girlfriend, Tia Mae Randall, 27, in the Michigan city of Wyoming on Thursday.
He was taken to court Friday in a hospital where he found himself after an officer drove him over in a police SUV as Nolin fired at police in an attempt to escape on a highway that was subject to heavy traffic.
Nolin has been charged with five serious crimes, including an assault to kill and an escape from police.
"Carrying out at the hospital is not common, but it's not the first such case," said Wyoming Police Captain James Maguffee.
"He is undergoing the necessary treatment, but the justice process must continue as well.
Judges often adapt so that this can be implemented."
Nolin's girl's body was found on Thursday in a mobile lodge in the Creekside Estates area.
The mother of two children was shot with one shot and police immediately identified Nolin as the suspect.
Police then issued a public warning against Nolin and gave a brief description of the man and his 1996 black Dodge pickup.
The man was spotted in his pickup and drove to the US 131 highway when police tried to stop him.
Nolin hit the concrete wall with a pickup, then got out of the car and ran off the highway.
As he ran, he fired at the pursuing policemen.
One policeman sat in a police SUV car and drove Nolina over from behind.
The observer filmed the event.
Nolin is taken to hospital in a severe but stable condition and will remain there until he is discharged and transferred to Kent County Prison.
"This event has shown that Western Michigan police officers are putting their health at risk to protect the community," Maguffee said.
"They arrested the man fairly quickly and by the right means and we are very proud of them."
Nolin has been charged in total with two counts of assault in order to kill, and is also charged with escaping police, carrying a concealed weapon, and committing a serious crime using a firearm.
He has not yet been charged with the murder of his girlfriend, as an investigation is ongoing.
"Of course, we are still investigating the murder, which we are about to conclude, so that we can submit in time to the Kent County District Attorney," Maguffee said.
The judge commended the brave man who knocked his teeth at the thief who broke into his house
The judge did not spare the greatest praise for the courage of a man who stood up against two criminals who tried to break into his house.
Although one burglar tried to squirm a wooden board for him, David Oldham, 63, was not scared.
A man working as a university territory supervisor defended himself, struck both criminals and knocked out the teeth of one of them.
The invaders fled, but after a fight, Mr. Oldham was left with blood, according to which Craig Ford was identified and arrested four months later.
In his sentencing to Ford, who had lost his tooth in an attempt to break into Mr. Oldham's 400,000-dollar individual house in Ormskerk, Lancashire, Royal Judge Clement Goldstone said: "You probably didn't expect Mr. Oldham's reaction to this kind of thing - when disguised to see only your eyes and nose, you came across him by the house, he hit you.
He also struck your accomplice, who tried to break into the second floor and jumped off the roof.
After sentenced Ford to three years and four months in prison on Friday, the judge said: "I hope you've learned two lessons.
First, you don't have to tease David Oldham, second, you better not start with the police.
Because of your crimes, you now have one tooth less than before and you have been bitten by a dog.
It's still a small punishment."
He added, "I want to commend Mr. Oldham for how he reacted to your actions."
Prosecutor Derek Jones said that Ford, who committed the crime in 2016, had already been convicted of another burglary and was due to serve three years in prison, but was released on parole.
Mr. Oldham told the Liverpool Royal Court he jumped when he heard a noise outside the house around 7 p.m. on 5 April.
Mr. Jones said: "Mr. Oldham, who is a wealthy man, bravely walked out of the house and resisted the accused heading towards him.
Fearing for his safety, he struck him in the face, thus striking him and knocking the tooth out.
Then another intruder jumped off the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively punched him in the face."
According to Mr. Jones, an accomplice took a wooden board and tried to squirm Mr. Oldham, and Ford said, "Shoot him, he knocked my teeth out."
An associate told Mr. Oldham, "If you let us go, we'll leave" and fled the crime scene with Ford.
Police caught Ford in a raid on a house in the Wavertree area on 2 August.
Ford kicked the police dog, then he bit him in the shoulder.
It is believed that the second burglar is still at large.
The 25-year-old Ford, who has no permanent residence, pleaded guilty to burglary, beating and dangerous driving, although this is forbidden to him and he does not have a driver's license.
Tory activists greeted Johnson's criticism with applause
Tory activists today humiliated Boris Johnson by applauding him when he was called a "minor and aggressive man".
Mr. Johnson, who is trying to please ordinary people with his uncompromising speeches about Brexit, received a harsh assessment from former Trade Minister Digby Jones, who was also endorsed this afternoon by participants in the Birmingham Conference.
David Davis also attacked Mr. Johnson because he is concerned about newspaper headlines rather than solid politics.
Speaking to MailOnline, May's ally in the cabinet added that he was simply "noisy" because he was unable to be a full-fledged leader.
Hostile reaction came when the former foreign secretary again attacked Prime Minister Chequers' plan and called it "insane" and "completely absurd".
Mr. Johnson also added that he genuinely believed in the project, and that she opposed the withdrawal in a referendum two years ago.
He also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, May countered that her critics were playing political games, insisting that she was not bluffing and was ready for tough negotiations with the EU.
In an interview on Andrew Marro's BBC show launching the Tory conference, Mrs May said: "I believe in Brexit.
Former Labour Trade Minister Lord Jones, now acting independently, received crowd approval to praise Brexit prospects.
People applauded when he voiced his opinion about Mr. Johnson, who allegedly answered "devil business" to questions from concerned businessmen.
Without specifically naming Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones made it clear that he was a "minor and aggressive man".
"Business is very important, so by saying 'fuck business', the former foreign secretary has shown that he is really a meager and aggressive man," he said.
"I totally disagree with him."
Lord Jones also commended the reaction of Mr. May, who was watching his speech in the hall, to the "trailers" heard by EU leaders at the Salzburg summit to her cabinet plan.
Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson earlier also criticized Mr. Johnson, recalling that he was a high-ranking government official during the Brexit negotiations.
May's ally in the cabinet told MailOnline newspaper that the intervention was not very serious and Johnson did not have enough supporters among the Tories in parliament to be able to expel the prime minister.
They said, "Now such news is not very dangerous.
He makes noise but does not have enough supporters in the parliamentary party and knows it himself.
We see a stark contrast between David Davis, who expressed his opinions respectfully, and Boris, who is fulfilling his personal ambitions."
Business Secretary Greg Clark criticized Mr. Johnson, who has attacked businessmen who are skeptical of Brexit.
Speaking at a Tory conference in Birmingham, Mr. Clark said Mr. Johnson was "completely wrong".
He said, "I'm surprised someone can think like that at all.
There is no successful economy in the world that does not have successful thriving businesses."
In an interview with Sky News' "Ridge on Sunday", Mr. Davis acknowledged that the coming months would be difficult as the EU would try to force the UK to provide many benefits.
However, he believes that the government must not give up and seek an agreement similar to the Canadian treaty, rather than the one the cabinet proposes.
When asked how Mr. Johnson succeeded in leading the Tories, he missed the opportunity to sting the former Foreign Secretary.
Smashing Mr. Johnson's proposal to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the drawbacks of British politics is politicians with fantastic ideas."
He added, "Our communication is chaotic and many of his ideas fit into headlines, but not solid politics."
Bulgaria spends 80 million euro of European taxpayers' money on poor restoration
Bulgaria spent 80 million euros of European taxpayer funds on poor restoration of ancient castles, which now look like built from "cheese and cardboard".
The Balkan country has spent 80 million euros from the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning the previous grandeur, the restoration received bullying.
In the areas adjacent to the Krakra fortress, the local government promised to remake the bad works.
The Bulgarian government spent tens of millions of EU ignorant medieval castles on restoration.
The Balkan country spent 80 million euros from the European Regional Development Fund to restore ancient castles and fortresses, but instead of returning their previous greatness, they received bullying over construction work.
The relics after the costly reconstruction look like they were built of "cheese and cardboard" so they are no longer attractive to tourists.
For example, the monument security guards were enraged that the medieval fortress Krakra of the western Bulgarian city of Pernik and the Roman fort Trayanovi Vrata next to Ihtiman were reconstructed using polymer concrete, commonly used for paving.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian government privately agreed that lessons should be learned from this failure.
"The fortress is in a lamentable condition," said architect and monument guard Stella Duleva about Trayanovi Vrata.
She has survived 16 centuries, and is now corrupt."
Such a reaction came after the restoration of the Krakra Fort in Pernik, so the local government promised to remove the delivered parts in 2019.
Pernik's fortress has been termed "a castle out of cardboard" due to its poor modifications.
The Byzantine Yailata Fort is nicknamed the "cheese fortress" because it was rebuilt from smooth white blocks that do not fit the facade affected by the weather.
These failed efforts coincide with newly raised doubts about how the European Union is using development funds.
A crowd of stylish bikers on their way to this year's event "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride"
Hundreds of motorcyclists from all over the UK, dressed in stylish suits, took to the streets on vintage motorcycles in order to raise money for the Movember Foundation.
The event is called "The Journey of a Furious Gentleman" and is organized annually to raise money and raise public awareness about prostate cancer.
This year, bikers gathered in London and 40 other places in the United Kingdom, including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
This year's "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" events take place in the UK and 650 other cities around the world and have so far managed to raise more than $5.5 million.
The official website of the event says that at this year's event, 120,000 people "dressed in scarves, tied ties, evened out their tweed suits, sat on their classic and vintage-style motorcycles, and allowed themselves to raise funds and raise awareness for men's health, specifically prostate cancer and men's mental health."
The event "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" in Sydney, Australia was first organized by Mark Hawwas.
The idea was inspired by a photo of the Mad Men character Don Draper, in which he sits on a classic motorcycle dressed in his best line.
At an event in London this year, hundreds of bikers drove on the Tower Bridge, including a dressed dog of the taxa breed, Sergeant Pepper.
Tennis ass Boris Becker revealed to have treated for skin cancer
Boris Becker thanked the doctors who had successfully removed skin cancer.
Becker's photographs barely show a small patch to his sunglasses.
"It was a routine check and it looks worse than it really is," he told the German newspaper.
After revealing that he had been treated for skin cancer, tennis legend Boris Becker was photographed with a patch on his nose.
On Wednesday, he tweeted in German about his health: "I want to thank Martina Mayr-Brune and Dr. Kati Maier from Munich who managed to cure me."
Photographs taken on Sunday of the 50th anniversary barely show a small patch to the sunglasses.
"I visited a dermatologist on Monday who removed basal cell carcinoma for me," Becker told the German publication Image.
"It was a routine inspection and looks worse than it really is."
Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, occurring in 75% of cases.
Once set in time, there is a high chance of recovery.
Becker is currently divorced from his wife, Lilly Becker, 42, and they announced their divorce in May.
The tennis star has won six important awards in the unit competition, 13 Masters Series titles and an Olympic gold medal in the doubles.
He was recently seen entertaining with friends at the 185th Oktoberfest in Munich.
Body volumes on a stranger's train platform kept the 24-year-old hammer thrower silent
On the train platform, a British athlete attacked by a stranger due to body volumes decided not to remain silent.
Jessica Mayho, who won the silver medal at this year's British Athletics Championship, says she was attacked Friday afternoon at Leeds station.
Mr. Mayho, 24 years old and five feet 11 inches tall, said that while waiting for the train she was pushed and verbally abused by a man.
At around 5 p.m. on the platform, the man who attacked the athlete called her a "thick".
However, a rising sports star seeking a place in the British team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics rebuffed her husband.
Mr Mayho, who hails from the town of Kitley in western Yorkshire, said: "It was the most defenses until other people turned their eyes on the full platform.
Such people may be intimidated and made to no longer believe in themselves, but it is MY body, MY "mechanism".
After posting about her adventure on Twitter, the young athlete received widespread approval on social media.
MBE Order Cavalier Andy Lewis wrote: "Stora!!!
Is he drunk or blind?
It's a fool, Jesse, it's okay with you.
Don't let a dumb-headed idiot ruin your mood."
Gavin Gray added: "I'm disgusted.
Not only for him, but for those around him who ignored him.
I'm glad you're okay.
You are an example to the younger generation.
You've shown that you have to be proud of yourself, and unsatisfied you can fuck off!"
Mr. Mayho, who works at the University of Leeds, became interested in hammer-throwing as a teenager, encouraged by one of her older sister's coaches.
Since then, she has managed to win second place in the Muller British Senior Championship, which was held in Birmingham in July of this year.
She won the British Championship medal just one month after winning the North English Games.
The athlete declined to comment further on the event.
Hacking accounts of at least 50 million users will result in Facebook having to pay a fine of $1.25 billion
Using a security flaw, criminals could access at least 50 million Facebook accounts.
However, a large-scale burglary was only reported three days later, on Friday.
Facebook now faces huge fine under new European data laws
Hacking at least 50 million accounts could result in Facebook having to pay a fine of 1.25 billion euros.
Criminals were able to access accounts due to a security gap, so many sensitive personal information could be disclosed.
However, Facebook only reported the hacking on Friday, three days later, and could not say until last night how many British accounts had been compromised.
While the search for the hackers continues, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks the web giant's compliance with European data compliance requirements as its headquarters are based in Dublin, criticized the company saying, "The report is incomplete."
Facebook faces a huge fine under new European Union data laws as companies may be required to pay up to four percent of global turnover.
Last year, Facebook earned 31.2 billion dollars in revenue.
Criminals reached out to accounts using Facebook's "View As" feature, allowing users to see what their profiles look like to others.

The MG Baltic case continues to listen to recordings: defendants discussed Gabrielius Landsbergis
The hearing was started by an audition of an interview (which took place in November 2015) between Raimondas Kurlianskis, the former vice president of MG Baltic, and Vytautas Gapšis, a former "worker".
Listening to the recording makes it difficult to understand exactly what the accused are talking about at the moment.
It is true that the record hears that R. Kurlianskis and V. Gapšys talk about the Christmas holiday, several times the surname of the current Conservative leader Gabrielius Landsbergis is sounded, but what exactly is being talked about is difficult to understand.
Allegations against both natural and legal persons
In the political corruption case, charges were brought against three legal and five natural persons: Labour and Liberal Movement parties, MG Baltic concern, former Liberal and "Labour" leaders E. Masiulis, Vytautas Gapšius, former Liberal MP Š. Gustainis, Seimas member G. Steponavičius and former MG Baltic vice president R. Kurlianskis.
Allegations against the Labour Party have been made regarding bribery and trade effects, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade in influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade in effect of these parties.
Officials suspect that politicians took or discussed bribes with R. Kurlianskis, then vice president of MG Baltic, and later proposed or supported initiatives favourable to the concern in the Seimas and other institutions.
Former Liberal Movement chairman E. Masiulis is suspected of trading in influence, bribery and illegal enrichment, former party vice-president G. Steponavičius is presented with allegations of abuse, and former Vilnius City Council member Š. Gustainis - bribery.
V. Gapšys is suspected of bribery and trade effects, R. Kurlianskis - of bribery and trade effects.
Poll: Who has the biggest chance of winning in the second round of the presidential election?
Four candidates at the top of the ratings - economist Gitanas Nausėda, unannounced Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis and two candidates who participated in the primary elections of the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) party - Seimas member Ingrida Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ušackas were included in the poll for the second round of elections.
True, it turned out on Sunday that TS-LKD had received support in the election by I. Šimonytė, and V. Ušackas withdrew from the election fight.
According to the data, if the election were to take place in the near future, in all cases, G. Nausėda would win in the second round of the president, but the head of "Vilmorus", sociologist Vladas Gaidys, says it is too early to draw conclusions.
"It's different (from others - DELFI) Nauseda, but it's very important to watch whether the parties are talking or about the people, what the dynamics are.
These were Šimonytė's doubles from one study to the next, and Nausėda had stopped growth, Ušacko even had a decrease.
It's very important for you to grow," says the sociologist.
In addition, when looking at the results of the poll, it is clear that a significant percentage of people have not yet decided who they will vote for or think not to go to the election at all.
If I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernelis were to fight in the second round of presidential elections, the fight would be tense - I. Šimonytė would vote 32.7%, and S. Skvernelis 30.9 percent.
It is true that as many as 36.4% of people responded that they would not vote for any of these candidates, or did not know which one they would vote for or would not go to the election.
Sociologist V. Gaidys emphasized once again that we are not seeing the full picture yet, as all candidates who would apply to the electorate of less successful Lithuania have not yet declared themselves.
"If we look at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where is the Social Democratic candidate? 30 years was the candidate, won't it be now?
When he declares himself, he will then see how his chances with the other candidates are built up.
So that side of Lithuania, which is less successful, is less reflected so far," V. Gaidys said.
For his part, Mažvydas Jastramskis, a political scientist at the Institute of International Relations and Political Science of Vilnius University (VU TSPMI), says that it is still very early to draw conclusions, and all three candidates, after rejecting V. Ušackas who has left the fight, look roughly.
"I can tell from my research experience that these differences mean nothing.
The difference of 5 percentage points certainly shows no candidate's advantage.
The only thing I could see to make Nausėda look good against Ušackas (...) again, given if those people came to actually vote.
Nausėda before Skvernel looks good too, but we compare now apples and potatoes, because, for example, Nausėda has already announced that he will participate, Skvernel has not announced.
In addition, the poll was done before the primary Conservative election, what would it look like after them?" the political scientist says.
According to him, G. Nausėda has a small plus, but once all the candidates have declared themselves, it may melt.
"The situation is pretty even.
Nausėda, Skvernelis, Šimonytė - results approximated.
I would like to remind you that half a year before the 2003 presidential election, Roland Paksas had 5% support to vote for him, and then won the election.
No predictions can be made," Jastramsky said.
DELFI reminds that the candidates in the presidential election have already been announced by economist G. Nausėda, Seimas member I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, Seimas member Aušra Maldeikienė, Liberal Movement member Petras Auštrevičius, Seimas member Naglis Puteikis and MEP Valentinas Mazuronis.
Iran accuses Israel of attempted cyberattack
"A regime whose history of using cyberweapons is clear from cases such as (computer virus) Stuxnet (disambiguation), this time attempted to violate Iran's communications infrastructure," Information Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi wrote on Twitter.
He was referring to the Stuxnet virus attack in 2010, which caused damage to Iranian nuclear facilities.
This malware is believed to have been developed by Israel and the United States.
"Because of the vigilance of our technical teams, they remained empty-handed.
We will continue to talk about this hostile action in international forums," Mr Jahromi stressed.
Deputy minister Hamid Fattahi said that technical teams had recorded many attempts to penetrate their systems during the early hours of Monday, but that the attackers had been "given a firm rebuff".
In the health club "Impuls" the man got sick, he failed to revive
The disaster occurred around 10:40 a.m.
The man who was swimming in the pool (born 1945) suddenly became ill, and was submerged under water.
The man was quickly pulled out of the water, but he was already unconscious.
Attempts were made to revive him.
Emergency medics soon arrived and tried to revive him, but they failed to save his life.
On the way to the hospital, he died in an ambulance.
Antanas Sakalauskas, head of the Health Clubs Network "Impuls", commented on this disaster.
"According to our data, a 73-year-old man visited our health club, Fabijoniškių St, with his wife on Monday morning.
The pool client was swimming for about 30 minutes, then swam to the strip separating the pool tracks to rest and collapsed unexpectedly a few minutes later.
The people next door - a customer who was sailing along the common trail and the pool supervisor - immediately reacted, pulled him out of the water and began to revive.
The man was constantly refreshed until the ambulance arrived.
The club staff immediately called an ambulance, which arrived within 5 minutes.
Upon arrival, the medics restored the man's pulse and breathing and transferred him to a medical car.
While going to the hospital, the medics tried to stabilize the man's health, unfortunately, after 20 minutes, we received information that the man did not survive.
We express our sincere condolences to the family of the deceased man for his loss.
According to initial data, the incident may have been due to health problems in the client.
According to information provided to family doctors, he had diabetes.
We remind you that in case of serious health problems, it is always very important to assess your options responsibly and consult with doctors and health club specialists.
The swimming pool facilities of all health clubs have an on-duty supervisor whose main task is to monitor the pool, its accesses and to ensure the safety of customers, and it is distinguished from other employees by its bright clothing.
Such pool keepers have radio stations that can be used to immediately contact the administration and the reception, answer their inquiries, or call for assistance.
Four times a year there are staff training sessions related to the security program - far more often than required by law.
During these, employees expand their theoretical and practical knowledge, teach how to behave in the event of a disaster, and monitor whether employees properly follow procedures and internal rules of procedure.
How Portugal Radically Solved the Heroin Problem
In the 1990s, Portugal faced a heroin crisis.
Almost every Portuguese knew someone who would have suffered from this deadly drug.
Now, just a couple of decades later, the country boasts some of the lowest rates of drug-related mortality in the world.
In Norway, he lost his son Gražina: he changed as many as four families and no longer speaks Lithuanian
According to the press release of the LNK, the Lithuanian woman lost her right of custody of her son four years ago and was seen with him by the decision of the Norwegian children's rights service "Barnevernet" and the courts.
The woman's story caused a near-international scandal that was followed by the entire media.
Nationals prepared pickets for the boy's return to Lithuania for his grandmother both in Lithuania and Norway.
However, publicity did not help Gražina and her family to recover her son, who had Lithuanian citizenship.
Today, the woman recounts how she has lived for the past few years separated from her son, and how her and her child meet after a two-year break.
By the time Gražina lost custody of her son, the boy was 8 years old, 12th today, the beginning of adolescence.
For the first two years, Gražina never saw her son, it was forbidden.
Gražina was later given the right to see her son twice a year, just one hour each.
During the last court hearing a few months ago, the number of dates for a Lithuanian woman was increased to three times a year and extended to two hours.
Meetings with his son each time resemble dates in a strict regime prison - monitored by the officers, and going to them - a secret operation.
"The son has changed as many as four families and no longer speaks Lithuanian," Gražina will open her heart this Tuesday evening, her story - on the LNK show
Eligijus Masiulis will not be returned personal money taken during the search
The Court of Appeals announced on Tuesday that it rejects the accused's lawyer's complaint.
The order is final and not subject to appeal.
In a political corruption case, E. Masiulis, the former leader of the Liberal Movement, pleaded with the Appellate Court to refund him some personal money - money taken during the search from his and his spouse's wallets.
In total, more than 242,000 euros were taken from Masiulis during the searches.
These moneys are subject to a temporary restriction of ownership and are constantly being extended.
It was last extended by the Vilnius Regional Court on October 15.
Masiulis did not ask the Court of Appeals for a full refund - he is seeking to recover 800 euros taken from his spouse's wallet and his wallet - 690 euros, 130 UK pounds, 1,600 US dollars.
A former politician says that the latter money was intended for a trip planned to the United States.
E. Masiulis' lawyer, Mindaugas Blues, requested a refund of this money at the Court of Appeal hearing on Monday, as the spouses were working well-paid jobs and had the opportunity to have such amounts.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius asked the court to dismiss the complaint.
"The ruling of the Vilnius Regional Court is legal and reasonable, and is not limited to more property, which is stated in the submitted charges.
The court correctly stated that it constituted the grounds for the confiscation of property as well as the extended confiscation of property," Laucius said at the hearing.
On October 15, the Vilnius Regional Court decided not to return more than 242,000 euros to the accused in the political corruption case against E. Masiulis.
The money was found during searches of the house and car of a former politician who had been charged with corruption.
The three-judge panel found that it was apparent from the case file that the property rights were limited only to the funds that make up the subject matter of the offences indicted against Mr Masiulis.
"Given the extent of the restriction, it must be concluded that the defendant's ownership is not disproportionately restricted or the restriction is imposed for too long," judges Nijole Žimkienė, Jurgita Kolyčienė and Ugnius Trumpulis wrote in the ruling.
The judges pointed out that in the case Mr Masiulis is accused of committing serious crimes, the criminal case is large-scale and complicated, so in order to ensure possible confiscation of property and extended confiscation of property, it is necessary to extend the accused's temporary term of foreclosure.
Prosecutors say former MG Baltic vice president Raimondas Kurlianskis gave a bribe of 106,000 euros to E. Masiulis for making decisions useful to the group in the Seimas.
Both defendants claim that the money found at Masiulis's house - 90,000 euros - was Kurliansky's loan.
According to the case, 242,400 euros, 130 UK pounds and US$1,600 were found in searches at Masiulis.
Masiulis and his lawyer made repeated attempts to recover the money, but the courts rejected their requests.
A former politician has said that some of these funds are owned by others and were intended to be invested in real estate or are his family's money.
He also said that there was no evidence that the funds were obtained in a criminal manner.
The Court of Appeals has previously announced that it is apparent from the charges against Masiulis that these funds may have been received when he accepted a bribe of more than 100,000 euros.
Law enforcement claims that the remaining cash taken during the search may have come from unidentified sources of income, undeclared, undocumented, and may not be legal income.
In the political corruption case, charges were brought against three legal entities - the Labour Party, the Liberal Movement, and the MG Baltic concern.
In addition to E. Masiulis, the charges in the case were brought against former "worker" Vytautas Gapšius, former parliamentarian Liberal Šarūnas Gustainis, Seimas member Gintaras Steponavičius, and former MG Baltic vice president R. Kurlianskis.
Kurliansky is accused of giving bribes to former parliamentarians E. Masiulis, Š. Gustainis and V. Gapšius.
The Americans recorded dangerous maneuvers by a Russian fighter
During the 25-minute interception, the U.S. Navy said the Russian SU-27 rushed right past the aircraft's front.
The Russian aircraft passed it a second time, taking advantage of traction acceleration, and made a turn with a turn.
Passengers reported feeling turbulence during the first approach and shaking during the second approach.
The Russian military has the right to conduct exercises in international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We expect international standards that provide security and prevent incidents consistent with behavior, including the 1972 Agreement on Incidents at Sea and Over Sea Prevention (INCSEA), the U.S. Navy said in a statement.
"Insecure action increases the risk of miscalculation and potential collisions," the report notes.
The Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged the incident, but said that the Russian SU-27 held a "safe distance" from the American aircraft.
Parents' costs continue to fall: extra-curricular activities are given as little as €50 per month
According to a survey by market and public opinion research company Baltic Research, a survey conducted in late August revealed that one-third (32%) of parents spent less than 100 euros on "shopping" their one-school-age child before school this year, one-fifth (21%) spent 101 to 150 euros, three out of ten (29%) spent 151 to 200 euros, and just under one-fifth (18%) spent more than 200 euros on preparing one child for school at the end of the summer.
Parents whose children started going to first grade this school year spent an average of about 220 euros on their child's school basket, while other parents whose children have already finished first grade have allocated a smaller amount - an average of about 160 euros for their child's preparation.
However, spending does not decrease as the school year progresses, as it is often necessary for parents to expand the wallet for children's groups and co-petitors.
Depending on the nature of the occupation, the cost of one squad in the country can range from 20 to 100 euros.
Parents who have school-age children were asked to say the average amount they plan to devote to their one-child extracurricular employment per month.
A quarter (23%) of those surveyed planned to spend up to 20 euros per month on extracurricular activities of the child, a further quarter (26%) said they paid up to 50 euros, three out of ten (31%) allocated between 50 and 100 euros per month for extracurricular employment of the child, and one sixth (17%) of parents indicated that they planned to spend 100 euros or more for this purpose.
It is true that in Lithuania, school-age children are given a basket of non-formal children's education, which consists of 15 euros per month.
However, this money can only be used for one squad, and if the cost of the occupation is higher, the difference must be covered by the parents.
In the event that a child attends several groups or several school-age children grow up in the family, the cost of extracurricular activities may double.
According to Justina Ambrasienė, marketing manager of consumer loan company "Vivus.lt", saving children's groups for a low- or middle-income family, especially when several children are growing up in the family, can become a significant challenge.
At the start of the school year, parents turned their heads, where to get money for exercise, stationery or new sportswear.
Now the main concern is how to take children after school without spending a heap of money on it.
We note that parents' expenses increase especially in August when they need to prepare properly for the new school year, but they also remain higher later than in the summer period, as parents tend to invest in the employment of their offspring.
Often, lacking in funds and responsibly assessing their capabilities, they are determined to borrow as well," says J.Ambrasienė.

In Kaunas County, 17 road users were killed this year (last year until the end of November - 27), and another 693 injured (last year - 591).
The residents of Kaunas are delighted by the fourth deranged trolleybus already.
Today, the fourth exhibit of the mobile street exhibition "Atia senienai, hello news" has rolled into the streets of Kaunas - the old trolleybus has been branded with a drawing and inscription "Sienograph notes".
A new fun trolleybus was reported by Kaunas City Municipality.
"This old lady 'Skoda' also changed her slightly bloated green color to a much more colorful and vivid outfit.
She is also a participant in the exhibition "Atia senenos, hello news!", the representatives of the municipality write to the uploaded photo.
The mobile street art exhibition "Atia senenos, hello news" is dedicated to saying goodbye to the old trolleybuses, which will be replaced by new ones as early as next year.
As early as next year, the old Škoda trolleybuses will travel on a well-deserved rest, to be replaced by 85 novelty and modern Solaris trolleybuses.
The portal recalls that the first trolleybus, decorated with street drawings, rolled into the streets of Kaunas a month ago.
The trolleybus features several well-known highlights of Kaunas street art - the old man's pipe and elephant.
Less than a week after the first performance, a second work by street artist Timomtiej Norvila - Morfai also rolled into the streets of Kaunas.
The trolleybus features a cheerful yellow car, which is often referred to simply as "the beetle".
"I wanted to put the trolleybus in.
This drawing looks very entertaining, especially since it also matches the trolley wheels.
When the wheels turn on the turn, it seems to be part of that car.
When we painted the wheels in white, we made them look like a retro style, it sounded very much like the whole combination.
Until the trolley tires were painted, they certainly didn't look so charming," the street artist spoke to the portal Kauno.diena.lt earlier.
And on October 27, a striking drawing lay on the third trolleybus as well.
It is topped with white, yellow, orange, and brown, but mostly blue paint.
This color is dominant.
The left side of the trolleybus body shows one of the houses of K.Donelaičio st., and the right side shows the central post office.
"The 'Wabal' is the sweetest one for me so far," Morphs uttered the third trolleybus in a way that marginalized the artist Morph.
Buy new
"Kauno diena" reminds that last week Kaunas public transport management company "Kauno autobusai" signed a 29.4 million contract with Polish company "Solaris Bus & Coach S.A" stating that Kaunas will buy 85 new trolleybuses.
"The city of Kaunas has invested the largest amount in the renovation of public transport throughout its history.
This contract will allow replacing the old Škoda brand trolleybuses that have served all of us for many years and offer passengers the most comfortable services.
New low-floor state-of-the-art trolleybuses will have more seats, efficient cabin conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, and an ergonomic driver's workplace.
New machinery and parallel overhead network upgrades and street repairs will allow trolleybuses to run more reliably, much faster.
And, undoubtedly, the trolleybuses of modern design will greatly decorate the city," Mindaugas Grigelis, CEO of the company Kauno Autobusai, said at the time.
The first new trolleybuses will reach Kaunas in August next year, and all old trolleybuses will be replaced by December.
Christmas sensation: Queen Elizabeth II invited Ms. Markle's mother to celebrate together
Duchess Meghan enchanted the British royal palace.
This is evidenced by a special gesture by Queen Elizabeth II: the British monarch invited Doria Ragland, the Duchess of Sussex's mother, to her Sandringham Palace for Christmas, according to British media.
Not even Duchess Kate's parents have received such honors.
Kate's parents Carole and Michael Middleton and other members of her family have so far only been invited to traditional Christmas services with the royal family.
An unnamed source revealed to the Sunday Express newspaper that the invitation to Doria Raglabd was "a sign of the Queen's respect for Meghan".
Doria allegedly enchanted the queen with "her own calmness" at the royal wedding in May.
The call to celebrate Christmas together has also fueled talk that Ragland is planning a longer stay in Britain.
It is speculated that she wants to help her daughter before and after giving birth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, are due to give birth in the spring of 2019.
The exhibition "Women's World" will once again be in the arena of "Žalgiris"
With the turn of the autumn routine and the more pervasive weather, the exhibition "Women's World" already held for the 16th time makes one impatient - women announce a long weekend, because even four days of the hottest fashion, style and beauty news are already right here - on 8-11 November, in the arena of Kaunas "Žalgiris".
Over the years, to see the face of the event change, the exhibition means no longer ordinary shopping, but a tradition of giving time to oneself.
It often becomes a meeting place for friends and a reason to spend the day with a sister or mom.
The four days of the exhibition have a special power - every woman here can learn the secrets of charm, learn tricks to look radiant every day, find irreplaceable products, hear or try various procedures that stop the aging process of the skin.
All this and more, promises as many as 415 exhibitors who will be waiting for visitors on all three floors of the arena.
Seminars on beauty and health will be held for three days, and on Sunday, women of the fair sex will be able to hear advice to create an exclusive image from the lips of the stylist and blogger Victoria Šaulytė.
A large proportion of women revolving in business face marginal situations where stress begins to interfere with a stable emotional and physical condition.
For this reason, the Kaunas Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Crafts and the Business Women's Network operating in them were born with the idea of holding a conference "Business and Happiness. Without Stress", where discussions and practical examples will encourage to help yourself in stressful situations and encourage to look at your life more creatively.
As every year, the exhibition is full of events dedicated to beauty masters.
The exhibition's long-time partners, the Association of Hairdressers and Beauty Specialists, will provide an opportunity to learn the subtleties of hair dyeing and modeling for two days from the charismatic duo - S. Maslov and R. Sakalauskas, formed by the international academy "Vinokurov & friends".
Those seeking to further improve will be waiting for the bride's role-playing contest and mastery of the fight "Art Battle", which will not leave anyone indifferent.
It is as if the cherry on the cake will become a festive fiesta "Happy Birthday, Lithuania" for the representatives of the world of beauty, where on the occasion of the centenary you will be able to see a show that has never been seen before - from body painting to dancing.
Another tradition of the "Woman's World" will not be forgotten - presentations of designers' latest collections on Friday's "Fashion and Beauty Show", where they will choose the most stylish ones.
And handicrafts supporters will be welcome at the "Decostudia" creative workshop, where they can create the interior of the original production house or decorate the gifts more interestingly.
On the last day of the exhibition, all long-casters are especially welcome, as traditionally visitors will be delighted by the competition "World Longhair LONG-HAIRED WORLD 2018", where new records of the longest box office are recorded every year.
Prime Minister: Teachers' salary increased by 117 euros after introduction of full-time payment
Since the introduction of the full-time payment model in September, average salaries of teachers in the country with a full-time workload have increased by 117 euros, Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis confirms.
"It is too early to say how much it (the new order - BNS) has advantages or disadvantages.
The fact is that those people who have a full workload - their salaries have grown by more than 117 euros on average," S. Skvernelis told reporters in the Government on Monday.
He called the plans of the Lithuanian Education Workers' Trade Union (LSDPS) to carry out a strike for full-time payment a "democratic right", but emphasized that the strike should not hinder the educational process.
"In a democratic country, all forms of protest are permissible, possible.
If one thinks one should strike, that is their right to self-determination.
Only again would it not be desirable for children and schoolchildren to be harmed in this place.
If there is to be a strike, it must be carried out in accordance with the laws in force," said S. Skvernel.
The Seimas in June approved the pattern of paying full-time teachers, and it has been introduced in stages since September.
School teacher payment has been replaced by hourly payment - the teacher's post consists of 1512 hours per year.
The teacher's working hours are divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation for them, and work for the community.
The reform is called absurd by the trade union led by Andrius Navickas, resentful of its acceptance of the "buldozer" principle and announcing that it will launch an indefinite strike on November 12.
The LSDPS requires the immediate abandonment of this "minute" wage system and the introduction of a full-time model with a maximum of 18 contact hours per post.
Also - increase the coefficients of the fixed part of the official salary by 20% and reduce the number of children in classes.
Among other innovations, there is criticism of the introduction of a new methodology for distributing training funds because, according to the trade union, there are insufficient funds for home teaching, for dividing classes into groups, for qualification, for educational assistance, and classes in large cities as they were remained overcrowded.
The Ministry of Education and Science said that the full-time payment of teachers' work will allow to adjust the workloads of educators and to compensate for all work for the school community.
It is envisaged that a teacher's full-time job for the community will be able to account for up to half of the total number of hours per year, up to 40% of the total hours for the first two years of work.
Teachers are set to work 36 hours per week, with a maximum of 24 contact hours per week to teach compulsory subject (subjects).
In May, approximately half a hundred general education schools, kindergartens and non-formal education institutions, and about 1,000 educators contributed to the two-hour strike initiated by the LSDPS.
In total, there are about 53,000 educators in Lithuania.
Call to be ready: crisis can be expected in 2-3 years
A slowdown in economic growth and even a crisis can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the country's Government are far more prepared for these processes than they were a decade ago, Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania, said in an interview for the "Knowledge Radio" show "Business Position".
"To suggest that the crisis - already around the corner, I certainly wouldn't be able to, but there are certainly signs of an economic slowdown.
Our country's economy grew by more than 3 percent this year, and we are planning a 2.8 percent growth next year.
The main message I would like to say to the public and business is - let's be ready for everything," V. Vasiliauskas said.
He believes that there are no uniform crises, so they need to be prepared in different ways.
The difference from the crisis of a decade ago is that at the time, the government thought that the income generated by the growing economy would be eternal, and the costs were planned based on this.
As a result, when the crisis hit in 2008, spending had to be drastically reduced.
Now, according to V. Vasiliauskas, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"It is true that we can see that the situation assessment of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance is different.
We think we are already exceeding the potential and need to press the brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not think so," said the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
V. Vasiliauskas scores 7 out of 10 in the preparation of the country's institutions for the upcoming crisis.
According to him, an economy as small and open as that of Lithuania is very heavily influenced by external factors.
The current push between the big elephants - the US, China, the European Union - will undoubtedly affect us as well.
We must therefore be very careful.
With little economy to say that we decide everything, it is possible, but I do not believe it," V. Vasiliauskas said.
What to look forward to in the future for those who have taken large loans?
According to V. Vasiliauskas, the European Central Bank has clearly put together a short-term strategy, and decisions on the change of interest can be expected no earlier than in the summer of next year: "Right now, perhaps the main goal is to try to manage expectations".
The trend that worries the head of the Bank of Lithuania the most is the decline of working hands in our country.
"The decline in the hands of labour is also a significant factor in the decline in the competitiveness of the economy.
It is also a decline in bread eaters.
Migration has allowed this year to balance this process a little, but it is not known if it is a long-term trend," V. Vasiliauskas believes.
ELTA recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy will grow by 3.4 percent this year, and by 2.8% the following year.
Swedish Conservative leader to try to form government again
The leader of Sweden's conservative Moderate Party, which has been in political stalemate for two months since the election, will get a second chance to form a government, the speaker of parliament announced on Monday.
Ulf Kristersson's Moderate Party is part of the four centre-right parties Alliance, which received marginally fewer votes in the September 9 election than the previous ruling centre-left coalition.
It was difficult for both blocs to rally a majority after refusing to negotiate with the anti-immigration Swedish Democratic Party, whose origins are in the neo-Nazi movement.
Kristersson's first attempt to form a government on October 14 was unsuccessful.
On October 29, the outgoing Prime Minister Stefan Lofven also announced his failed attempt.
In an attempt to get the parties to agree, parliament speaker Andreas Norlen said he would propose Kristersson to parliament next week as a candidate for prime minister, pushing the first vote since the government's formation efforts began.
"It is not clear in advance whether the various parties will accept Ulf Christersson as prime minister," Norlen told reporters.
However, he stressed that "the process must move forward, and the dynamics between the parties must change".
"Fruitless negotiations must end," he added.
The date of Parliament's vote is not yet clear, but Norlen said November 14 was among the possible dates.
In Sweden, the Speaker of Parliament may delegate four times to any candidate to form a government with which the Parliament would agree.
If all four attempts fail, the country must hold new elections.
The current appointment of U. Kristersson is the third attempt by A. Norlen.
Some Moderate Party and Alliance partner Christian Democratic groups are pressuring Kristersson to accept the support of the far-right Swedish Democratic Party, but he has so far ruled out such a possibility.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6% of the vote in the election and is the third largest party, has long been ignored by all major current parties.
The far-right party, which successfully used voters' anger over immigration in the election after nearly 400,000 asylum seekers had entered the country since 2012, is demanding influence in decision-making in exchange for support.
However, the Liberal and centrist members of the Alliance categorically oppose such an idea.
The Swedish Social Democratic Labour Party (SAP), which has ruled with green and informal leftist support since 2014, has meanwhile provided opportunities for cooperation between the blocs, but only if it retains the post of prime minister.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party rejected this possibility.
Afghan government delegation to attend peace talks in Russia
A delegation from the Kabul government will attend international talks on peace in war-torn Afghanistan held in Russia this month, officials said Monday.
The Taliban, in turn, are still considering whether to participate.
Russia announced on Saturday that it would hold such a conference in Moscow on November 9, although the United States is currently trying to establish bilateral talks with the Taliban to end the 17-year-old conflict.
The Afghan government's High Peace Council, which is in charge of reconciliation efforts with the militants, will send four representatives to a meeting in Moscow, spokesman Sayed Ihsan Taheri told AFP.
However, the Afghan foreign ministry has avoided responding to whether it will send its delegation to the conference, which will focus on initiating peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still negotiating with Russian officials," said spokesman Sebaghtullah Ahmadi. - We congratulate any peace efforts led by Afghans.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the movement was still considering whether to go.
Moscow also invited representatives from the United States, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet republics of Central Asia.
Pakistan, long accused of supporting the Afghan Taliban, will "necessarily participate", Foreign Ministry spokesman Muhammad Faisal told AFP.
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has not yet responded to a request for comment.
The meeting was originally planned for September in Moscow, but was postponed after Kabul demanded that the process be led by Afghans.
Negotiations will take place during sensitive times.
Newly appointed U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is trying to convince the Taliban to agree to negotiate an end to the war and there are fears that a multilateral meeting in Russia could disrupt these efforts.
A U.S. government watchdog indicated last week that Kabul government power in Afghanistan has weakened in recent months.
Cuban President met with North Korean leader in Pyongyang
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, both of whom hope for the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions, have agreed to expand and strengthen their countries' strategic relations, North Korean state media reported on Monday.
Diaz-Canel, who arrived in Asia on his first international trip since coming to power in April, flew to Pyongyang with his wife on Sunday.
Kim Jong Un met him at the airport; the leaders drove into the city together through the crowds that greeted them.
North Korean state media reported that the leaders held talks at the state guest house "Paekhwawon", highlighted the shared socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not give much detail, but indicated that the atmosphere of the talks was friendly.
The meeting with Kim Jong Un could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to secure significant progress on North Korea's denuclearization are increasingly stalled.
Pyongyang, which has also been quietly seeking Moscow's favor, is tightening rhetoric ahead of a planned meeting in New York this week between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea's main negotiator Kim Yong Cholo.
Over the weekend, Pyongyang, through its official media, criticized the U.S. for irrevocable sanctions, a political tool that Washington also used extensively against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea hinted it could further develop its nuclear weapons program if Washington did not change course.
Sanctions are an important item on the Diaz-Canel agenda.
During a visit to Moscow last week, Diaz-Canel discussed a nearly $50 million (US$43.8 million) arms contract with Russia and received a similar pledge from Vladimir Putin to expand political, economic and military ties.
The two presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the U.S. "interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states."
The U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, first imposed in 1958 and then extended, remains in effect.
Russia's severe U.S. and European Union sanctions were imposed due to the annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Diaz-Canel is due to leave Pyongyang on Tuesday.
He will still be visiting China, Vietnam and Laos.
In storage areas - cars unsafe?
On Saturday, a woman approached police officers asking them to find out this case of fraud.
According to the woman, the Hyundai Santa Fe car, produced in 2006, left the site to be stored at the end of September.
She spotted the ad on the website on November 3.
It turns out that the crooks sought to sell her vehicle for €3,800.
According to the owner, the car may have been stolen.
A man born in 1989 tried to sell the vehicle.
According to police, the person is not the owner of the site.
An investigation is being conducted to investigate the circumstances of the crime.
According to firefighters, a fire broke out on Bandužiai Street on the seventh floor of the apartment building on Sunday evening at about 10 p.m.
Scraps piled up in a one-room apartment and a sofa standing in the room burned.
The owner was taken out of the apartment and examined by doctors, police reported.
Burnt and incensed objects were thrown out of the apartment through the window.
During the fire, the staircase walls of the seventh floor were engulfed.
Record: Athlete circumnavigated Britain in 157 days
A British athlete disembarked from the sea ashore in England on Sunday, becoming the first person to circumnavigate Britain along the coast.
Ross Edgley, 33, spent 157 days in the water and overcame 2,883 kilometres.
He would sail for six hours each, and spend the night on board the support team that accompanied him.
The last mile was overcome by the athlete accompanied by hundreds of fellow swimmers.
He went ashore in Margate in south-eastern England - this is where Mr Edgley began his journey on 1 June.
The athlete, who planned to keep up in 100 days, said to the relatives who met him on the shore, "Sorry, I'm late".
He said that when he got ashore, he felt relief first.
"I was very worried that my legs wouldn't stand," the athlete said.
The World Swimming Open Waters Association indicated that Edgley had repeatedly faced extreme weather conditions during this endurance test, which was sponsored by energy drink manufacturer Red Bull, and that the athlete had been delayed 37 times by jellyfish.
Organizers announce that Edgley has doubled the record for the longest sea-breaking swim, which to date has been 73 days.
He also achieved a new record, most likely overcoming the distance between the southernmost and northernmost points of Great Britain - Cape Lands End and John O'Grouts.
The athlete overcame this distance in 62 days.
The macabre secret of the Clebonish forest: one suspect has already been detained
It was a horrendous find by a passer-by, as the dead man was buried shallowly.
It was only in these circumstances that this crime was discovered, as the killer victim had no relatives and his disappearance was not reported.
According to initial data, he was not too old for adulthood.
Like the suspects in his murder.
One of them was allowed to be arrested by the Kaunas District Court last week for three months.
The second, who is suspected of fleeing abroad where he is hiding from his sentence for another crime, is still being sought.
Until it is found, law enforcement is not inclined to comment further on the circumstances of this crime.
I. Valinskienė: I would accept many things for my children
The ranks of the country's most prominent artists appearing in the new-build rock opera Love and Death in Verona are expanding.
Inga Valinskienė joins the team of artists, who is entrusted with one of the most important roles of the work - a known woman will play Juliet's babysitter.
Povilas Raška, who will take care of singing artists, also became an important part of the team.
"I think love stories have been created a lot and very beautiful since Shakespeare's time, but 'Romeo and Juliet' will apparently always remain a symbol of these stories and will be staged for a long time to come.
It will be interesting to become part of one of such productions," says I. Valinskienė about the new test that fell on his shoulders.
Although a well-known woman is well-known on stage, has created a number of roles in various performances or musicals, nannies have not yet played her.
"The time to play Juliet has passed," I. Valinskienė smiles.
- In my own time, I probably would have gladly accepted such an offer as well."
True, the nanny character in Shakespeare's drama is no less important, even considered by some critics to be the most important.
The nanny is not only a mediator, a helper - her manner and tone of speaking, the feminine attitude towards feelings and the resulting solidarity with lovers gives more and different colors to the plot.
In addition, the nanny is also important because she is one of only two women in the drama "Romeo and Juliet".
"The nanny character is not very close to my way and style, but sometimes it's just more interesting.
Creating a different character than you have yourself - a fun part of the creative process.
I do not yet know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the director's interpretation," says I. Valinskienė and reveals that being in Juliet's nanny's place would probably do the same.
- I think the nanny was listening to her heart.
This is what most women do.
That's probably what I would do."
The legendary rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" by Kęstutis Antanėlis is based on Shakespeare's famous drama "Romeo and Juliet".
A work based on real facts tells the tragically ended love story of two young people - Romeo and Juliet.
The sad outcome of the story is determined by the uncertainty of where the conflict between the young families - Monteki and Kapulechi - comes from.
"All stories are possible at all times.
Parents who are against the choice of children have always been and will be.
Only today are solutions to such problems - more diverse - when asked if today the story of Romeo and Juliet could be repeated, says future nanny I. Valinskienė.
"In the name of my own children, I would reconcile myself with many things, including my daughters-in-law."
The main roles - Romeo and Juliet - will be played by Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justinas Jarutis in the rock opera directed by actor and director Ramūnas Cicenas, Vidas Bareikis, Kęstutis Cicenas, Mindaugas Papinigis, Marius Jampolskis, Paulius Šinkunas and Aidas Barkauskas will also appear on the stage.
The latest production of the rock opera Love and Death in Verona will be presented to the audience in late December.
The first legendary piece to shine in new colours will be seen by the audience of the Vilnius Siemens Arena on 28 December.
A day later, on December 29, the rock opera will be shown at the Klaipėda "Lighthouse" arena.
E. Jankauskas announced with which footballers will finish the League of Nations tournament
Lithuanian football team coach Edgaras Jankauskas announced the composition of the national team for the UEFA Nations League matches with Romania and Serbia on 17 and 20 November.
23 footballers are invited to the national team camp, which will begin on November 13.
13 of them compete in foreign clubs, and 10 play in the Lithuanian A-League.
Three representatives in the national team will be from Vilnius "Žalgiris" and "Trakai", two from Marijampolė "Sūduva" and "Kauno Žalgiris".
Most of the national team leaders - Fyodor Chernykh, Arvydas Novikov, Ernest Shetkus, Vykintas Slivka and others come to the national team.
The team will not be able to be helped by the hard-hitting strikers Lukas Spalvys and Karolis Laukžais and safety Ovidijus Verbickas, and defender Vytautas Andriuškevičius.
After a three-year break, 23-year-old guard Grat Sirgaud returns to the team.
He made his debut for the national team at the age of just 18, following the successful 2013 European U-19 Championship.
At the European Youth Championship held in Lithuania, G.Sirgedas scored 3 goals and became the top scorer and was selected to the symbolic championship team.
However, later, the prospect footballer's career was hampered by injuries.
After a two-year break, another defender of "Kauno Žalgiris", Mark Beneta, received an invitation to the team.
Egidijus Vaitkūnas and Edvinas Girdvainis, who missed the defending team with Romania and Montenegro, return to the lineup due to injuries to the League of Nations game in October.
"We will seek to win the first points in the League of Nations, even though we are expecting a very tough duel in the rival squares.
At home, we lost to both the Serbs and the Romanians by a minimum margin.
There was also a lack of success.
We hope that the guests will succeed in retribution.
Although for the competitors it is a decisive fight for first place in the group and an opportunity to continue the fight for a trip to the European Championship," said E.Jankauskas, the coach of the Lithuanian national team.
With two rounds remaining until the end of the League of Nations group competition, there is a very persistent fight in Division C 4.
After four rounds, Serbia's 8-point national team takes the lead.
Just a point behind the leaders is Montenegro, with Romania in third place by two points.
The meeting of the Lithuanian national team with Romania will be held on 17 November at the Ilie Oana stadium in Plojeszcz.
Serbia's national team will accept Lithuanians at Belgrade's Partizan Stadium on November 20.

"Skamp" introduces a song whose video has already refused to be shown on one TV
The band "Skamp", commemorating the 20th anniversary of the activity, started making music again this year.
After announcing the only anniversary concert "Skamp20" to take place at the Vilnius Siemens Arena on 26 December, the trio presents new works one by one.
This time - it's "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" and a bold video of the song.
"This track is about love, so I thought that all types of relationships should be perpetuated in the video, regardless of age or sexual orientation," Erica Jennings, who is convinced that any manifestation of homophobia in 2018 is not normal, reveals the idea of a new song and video.
The new song "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" video filmed over ten couples of different orientation and age: "We have always supported LGBTQIA communities and believe that one day we will no longer have to discuss it," says Viktor Diawara, who composed the music of the track early in the year on a family holiday in Israel.
True, due to this video, "Skamp" has already managed to get negative reactions - it was not wanted to be shown by one of the most popular shows in the country.
That says a lot about our society.
TV won't show the video because it shows people kissing and it's supposedly inappropriate content for children.
And the fact that turning on the TV at any time of the day can be applied to on-screen fights and other examples of violence is the right content?" asked Mrs Jennings rhetorically.
Erica also antifies Vilius Alesius: "I would like to see more people holding hands and kissing around, regardless of their social status, gender or age.
We raise children and want them to grow up in an environment with as much tolerance as possible and as little bullying as possible.
We want to make our listeners' day a little brighter with a new song and video and give them a smile."
The band "Skamp" has been known since 1998 for bold lyrics in which they spoke on unpopular or sensitive topics.
All of the band's best - old and new - songs will sound loud and wide at the "Skamp20" concert as early as December 26 at the "Siemens" Arena in Vilnius.
It welcomes everyone with their families, and free admission for children under 10.
At the Clinic Viaduct - a traffic accident: a man who was riding a bicycle was hit
A few minutes after 9 a.m., the editorial of the portal kauno.diena.lt was reached by readers' information about police and ambulance crews heading towards Kaunas clinics.
An interest has revealed the reasons for this commotion.
Kaunas police watchman confirmed to the portal that there was a traffic accident at the Viaduct of Clinics located at the intersection of Utena and Eiveniai Street.
A car and a cyclist collided during it.
According to a spokeswoman for Kaunas Ambulance, a person who was riding a bicycle was injured in the accident.
Fortunately, major injuries were avoided, and no open wounds were seen on the body.
A medical examination of the victim at the scene of the disaster.
Drivers report that the accident may make this section of the road more difficult to pass.
Presidential Palace: LRT is not the property of politicians
As the Seimas intends to return to the consideration of the conclusions of the commission that investigated LRT activities, the Presidential Palace fears that the ruling parties are simply seeking to gain more political control over the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is not the property of politicians, and the fundamental principle is to maintain that independence from politicians," Mindaugas Linge, an advisor to the president, explained to Žinių Radijas.
However, the advisor emphasized, the opposite process can be seen at the moment.
"It can be seen that those (political. - ELTA) influences want to have more.
That is what we are assessing critically enough," Linge said.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT commission operating in the Sejm are questionable and questionable because they target the independence of the broadcaster.
Although, stressed M. Lingė, there is a need to improve LRT governance, this should be done on the basis of expert assistance and in search of specific aspects that impede the smooth operation of LRT.
He emphasized that already now international institutions stress that LRT's activities should be supervised not by political institutions but by competent authorities.
On Tuesday, the Seimas intends to decide on the conclusions of the commission that investigated LRT activities.
These findings have attracted much criticism.
The proposals to change LRT's governance - to reduce the powers of the Council and to link the terms of its members with the terms of the appointing authorities - were highly sceptical.
In light of this concern, the European Broadcasting Union has expressed itself.
An opposition group of members of the Seimas applied to the Constitutional Court in January on whether a special parliamentary commission investigating LRT's activities and finances is not in conflict with the Constitution.
For those working abroad - good news from R. Karbauskis
The Seimas began to consider an amendment to the Residential Declaration Law submitted by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the elder of the Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union faction, whereby citizens working and paying taxes outside Lithuania would be exempt from compulsory payment of health insurance contributions.
After submission, the draft was supported by 56 MPs on Tuesday, with 9 against, and 25 abstentions.
After deliberation in the committees, the draft is scheduled to be debated in the plenary sitting of the Seimas on 6 December. The Seimas also decided to ask for the Government's conclusion.
According to the proposed project, persons who pay social insurance contributions in the member states of the European Union, the states of the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation are exempted from paying compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania by the decision of the Administration Office of the State Social Insurance Fund.
Those living and working outside Lithuania would be considered to have left Lithuania according to the data provided and approved by the State Social Insurance Fund Board ("Sodra") and the State Tax Inspectorate.
It's about services that a person doesn't use.
There are additional opportunities to capture the fact that a person is away," R. Karbauskis explained from the Seimas tribune.
Such a proposed legal regulation would, in the opinion of Antanas Matulas, be unfair to citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.
"Some Lithuanians living abroad abuse this," Matulas remarked.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas believes that in this way we urge citizens not to comply with the obligation.
In his opinion, the prerequisites for the use of the health care system by the shrews would be made free of charge.
With the adoption of the proposed amendments to the law, individuals who have gone to live in other countries pay social security contributions there, will not accumulate debts, and will be relieved by the burden of debt administration of the "Sodra".
Currently, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania, but have not declared their departure in the Population Register in accordance with the procedure established by legal acts, are charged monthly compulsory health insurance (PSD) contributions, and if they are not paid, the debt accumulates.
A. Bread convicted of fraud, but acquitted of forgery
The Vilnius Regional Court upheld the sentence for attempted fraud against the convicted former famous sportsman Alvydas Duona, but he was acquitted of falsification of documents.
The court verdict announced on Monday came into effect immediately.
A. Bread was sentenced to imprisonment for three and a half years, with the execution of the sentence being postponed.
The multiple Lithuanian kayak rowing champion was convicted by the Vilnius City District Court in March this year.
He was given a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence.
After examining the case under the convict's complaint, the Vilnius Regional Court removed one charge, but the sentence remained the same.
The former athlete will also have to pay nearly €760 to the Victims of Crime Fund.
The prosecutor's office accused Duonal of having forged a bill in 2013, whereby he lent 200,000 Litas (about 58 euros) to the dental office headed by his now ex-wife, Dalia Burokaitė.
It was not until December 2016 that the spouse became aware of this, when she received calls to pay off her debt.
The ex-spouse said she never borrowed money from her husband for clinic purposes and did not sign the bill.
According to the judges of the Vilnius Regional Court, there is no objective data in the case proving that it was A. Duonėla who would have recorded the incongruent data, that supposedly it is UAB "Dalecija" who owes A. Duonė 200 thousand Litas.
The arguments set out in the complaint of the convict and his/her defender are acceptable, and there is no objective evidence to support this in the case.
Having thus stated that A. Duonela had only used a forged genuine document for fraud and having acknowledged that this feature - the use of a forged document - is an integral part of fraud (in the case under consideration - attempted fraud), A. Duonela is acquitted under Paragraph 1 of Article 300 of the Criminal Code without proving that he was involved in the commission of a criminal offence," the Vilnius County Court's verdict reads.
Firefighters were waving cats buried in the ground - they heard the digger for three days
As reported by the Kaunas County Fire and Rescue Board, a report was received that a cat buried after changing thermal piping for three days.
When the firefighters arrived, they also heard the cat's sniffing.
It was discovered that thermal track repairs had been carried out here a few days earlier.
It is assumed that two cats may have been grounded while burying the track under the overlay.
Firefighters unearthed an overlay of the thermal track at a depth of one and a half meters and knocked out a cavity in it for the cats to come out.
Son of Antonino Scalia says his father wouldn't be surprised by Liberal protests over Kavanaugh
The son of late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia told Fox News on Sunday that his father would not be surprised by the extreme forces protesting against nominated judge Brett Kavanaugh because Scalia felt the Supreme Court was too meddling in the affairs of the modern world.
"Generally speaking, he wouldn't be much surprised by the noise of the nomination to the Supreme Court, because much is based on the case of Roe v. Wade - at least that's what the left claims," said Christopher Scalia, recalling the landmark 1973 case that established the constitutional right of women to abortion in certain trimesters.
Roe's case at one point overturned the rights of all states to regulate abortion themselves, and some states immediately tried to restrict the right to abortion in response to this decision.
"My father often said that in Roe v. Wade and other cases, the court did try to solve cultural problems, even though they had to be solved through elections and legislative process," he added during a show on Fox & Friends.
"In an attempt to speed up the process, the Supreme Court inflicted further damage, leading to nominations for the Supreme Court and disputes over confirmation causing a more severe reaction as judges take on a role belonging to legislators."
Nebraska Senator Republican Ben Sasse expressed a similar opinion at a hearing this month on Kavanaugh's approval, reiterating that Congress often gives too much power to executive agencies that are largely not accountable to anyone, and leaves the resulting bureaucratic issues to the Supreme Court, so judges must take a job that senators refuse.
Capitol Hill police arrested and charged hundreds of protesters with illegal interference in the candidate's approval process.
When asked if Kavanaugh could avoid a hostile reaction on unconfirmed accusations of sexual misconduct he allegedly did decades ago, Scalia said he was unlikely to avoid the noise.
In response to statements that Kavanaugh should not hold office in the Supreme Court, as he reacted fervently and sometimes presumptuously during a senatorial hearing on Thursday, Scalia questioned whether all judges were of a quiet character.
"The judges are often angry," Scalia said of the angry disagreements that sometimes arise in controversial cases.
"Actually, Judge Kavanaugh must have reacted more aggressively, but it was different circumstances.
He tried to defend his good name against unconfirmed charges."
On Thursday, Kavanaugh was allowed to take part in the vote of the entire Senate by a majority of the party's votes (11 against 10) on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake stated in a dramatic moment that he would only give his decisive vote to Kavanaugh if the FBI was given a week to investigate the current likely charges of misconduct brought against Kavanaugh.
The investigation is ongoing and President Trump said the agency has broad authority and can question "whatever it wants".
Schiaparelli's collection of ready-to-wear clothing includes fantastic clothing
Is it possible to embody surrealism?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
The Paris Fashion House, founded almost a hundred years ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, presented its first collection of ready-made clothes and handbags.
For the fantastic rather than wearing ready-to-wear brand, this collection is almost as incredible as the famous Elsa Schiaparelli flip shoe-shaped cap.
The fashion house, which has long fostered an eccentric image, also appeared as a very modern one this time.
In aesthetic solutions you will find emoticons, lobsters, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli created her first overall in 1930 and was the first designer whose models marched the podium to music.
She and her friend Salvador Dali came up with the idea of combining art and fashion, and now Calvin Klein and Raf Simons, working with US artist Sterling Ruby, took over the idea.
The legend of Skland is that Dali, along with the evening dress created by Schiaparelli and embroidered with a lobster motif before the demonstration, wanted to smear a real mayonnaise, but did not get approval.

"We wanted to come back to the idea of collaboration, which is indistinguishable from the history of Schiaparelli," said Bertrand Guyon, who has been working as creative director for the past three years, when he was interviewed at a fashion house salon in Vandom Square.
While creating the ready-to-wear collection, he relied on Schiaparelli's friendship with Man Ray and in collaboration with the Man Ray Foundation, he created clothes based on well-known works of art.
A famous photograph of the artist's zoomed eyes, "Glass Tears", is shown on a T-shirt pinned with "Perspex" tears, and red lips from "Observatory Time: Lovers" are printed on a straight silhouette dress with a collage by the silkscreen method.
My Ray's "Glass Tears" on collection T-shirts
One of Elsa's oddities was the superstitious attraction to the letter S. Her branded color, "Shockering Pink," inspired her perfume, "Shocking."
Guyon's first designed Schiaparelli handbag with a keyhole on the buckle is called "The Secret".
Its retail price will also be a fantastic $5,000.
Yesterday, a temporary store was opened in a warehouse on the old left bank, showing the surreal side of Paris Fashion Week and the carpets of Virgil Abloh from the soon-to-be-present Ikea collection were available for €100.
Half an hour before the opening, more than 500 young Abloh fans lined up in line on the pier, eager to purchase one of his works at more favorable prices than the Louis Vuitton men's clothing he was creating.
For Ablohui, this project helps to reach a wider audience than the one for which luxury fashion or designer-designed furniture is available.
"No one has any property anymore, but knowledge of a particular chair can help establish a conversation at the lunch table.
That's what the millennial generation thinks," he recently said.
Audiences gathered in the Marais district realized that this garage event would not be common when the models began to ride past them on skateboards.
The collection of Vivienne Westwood's male designer Andreas Kronthaler's loose colourful men's and women's robes was based on portraits of Jessica Fulford-Dobson's Kabul skateboarders.
Some women (and a few men) who were wearing high-heeled sandals were riding on skateboards, but they were walking in their own platform shoes of dizzying height.
Westwood, who watched the show in the first row and was wearing a collection dress with horse motifs and an orange cardigan woven over her waist, joined her husband for the last bowing on the podium, who gave her a bouquet of flowers.
A strong twin bond in pictures
Detroit-born and London-based Peter Zelewsky was already established as a street photographer when he started taking pictures of twins four years ago.
"As a portrait photographer and human being, I have always been fascinated by the twins and their extraordinary connection that everyone is talking about," he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, but, he said, "after taking a portrait of the first twins, I became addicted and there was no way back".
Zelewsky's forthcoming book, Twins, will feature photographs and stories of 44 identical pairs of twins.
This project is more visual, he says, "It's not a documentary or a scientific project - I wanted to take pictures of impactful and sensuous portraits of people."
Nurses expressed no confidence in the trade union that led the wage negotiations
Members of the Royal College of Nursing, unhappy with the union's deal with the National Health Service for salaries, expressed no confidence in the union after the vote and accused it of skewing claims of pay increases that were expected.
This unprecedented decision came after prolonged debate at the Royal College of Nursing, when its former Secretary-General Janeta Davies admitted to falsely promising members that their salaries would immediately increase by 3% this year once the 1% pay limit was lifted.
After not getting the expected salary rise, members became angry and forced Davies to step down, then petitioned and held an emergency meeting in Birmingham on Friday, after which they expressed no confidence in the college council.
"The fair and open debate in Birmingham has helped clarify the relationship, so the college will only strengthen," said Maria Trewern, director of the Royal College of Nursing.
"The vote is clear and the Royal College of Nursing board and management understood the message sent to her.
The Council has already sought change in the organisation in recent weeks and has tried to listen to the words of the members and engage them; we will continue our efforts to implement this."
The meeting will be held next week and members of the Royal College of Nursing council are expected to step down.
"The basis of care is trust," the National Health Service nurse told the Guardian newspaper.
"The actions of the Royal College of Nursing Council have eroded confidence in her, so the council must withdraw.
I hope she will act honorably and listen to the request.
I wonder if members of other trade unions will also push for reform."
A general trade union state official in the National Health Service, Rachel Harrison, told Guardian in August: "Having received salaries, National Health Service workers from across the country realized they had not received the expected raise.
It angered them."
Prior to the unusual meeting, the Royal College of Nursing admitted that it had made mistakes in the 2018 salary negotiations and made poor information about them.
However, it is also claimed that the campaign by the Royal College of Nursing for the abolition of the pay limit forced the government to abandon this restriction and pledge to gradually increase wages by 6.5 percent over three years.
The vote came after an independent investigation found that the college was inclined to yield in negotiations, and Davies was accused of underestimating the deal.
It is alleged that the Royal College of Nursing provided information that was not in line with the facts, so the members were unable to make a reasonable decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The college released conflicting information as to whether all employees would receive a 3% salary increase.
In a brief statement before the college convention, representatives were mistakenly said to have planned "a 3% raise and increase in the gradual implementation of reform".
In fact, wages had to be gradually raised to 3% and only some of the highest wage earners would have received an immediate increase.
"Almost all of the information given to members of the meeting about the implementation of the deal was false (probably because of attempts to simplify it)," said a spokesman for the Electoral Reform Service, which conducted the investigation.
"The ERS considered that the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction were not explained in a comprehensible and concise manner to decision-makers and did not explicitly state the main advantages, including the 6.5% and 29% calculations mentioned during the campaign, making it impossible to make a reasonable decision."
The no-confidence decision was supported by 78% of those who voted, and the vote was attended by 3.74% of the members of the Royal College of Nursing.
Lindsay Lohan shocked Instagram live streaming viewers by trying to "rob" children from family
Lindsay Lohan received criticism for Instagram's live broadcast, during which she followed a homeless family on the street and tried to separate her sons from their parents.
Live broadcasts, most likely filmed in Moscow (deciding on Lohan's previously updated Instagram story), initially offered to provide the family with a hostel, but the situation quickly complicated.
"Hello to everyone! I want to show what family I have met," she told the audience, "it's Syrian refugees, I'm very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to go with me?
Let's go, I'll take care of you," she told the family before turning to one of the children, "Would you like to sleep in a hotel?
Watching movies?
It would be fun to watch the movie on TV or computer."
When his parents refused, Lohan reacted hostilely.
"Your children shouldn't be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
"If someone offers them a home and a place to stay, like me now, you should agree.
They'll come back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't joke with me."
When the family tried to move away from Lohan by walking down the street, the actress followed her further live on Instagram.
"Look what's going on, it's child trafficking. That's how you spoil Arab culture.
You marry children, even though they don't want to go with you.
Boys, don't worry, I'm with you and the whole world is seeing us now."
The broadcast ended in a physical confrontation, with the mother seemingly punching Lohan.
Video clips spread on social media and some users became interested in whether this could not be equated with an attempted kidnapping.
The Independent contacted Lohan's representative for comments.
A third of Britons think they will never pay off all their debts
Nearly a third of Britons believe they will not be able to pay their debts in a lifetime, and one person in 10 believes they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study by Equifax and Gorcana, whose results have only been revealed by The Independent, found that Britons, especially those in the 18-24 age group, believe they will have debts for their entire lives, and only half of them expect to get out of them.
A report published last year by the Institute for Fiscal Research found that students who graduate are left with a debt of around 46,000, while the poorest students remain in debt of over 57,000.
Most graduates (81 percent) will never pay off their entire debt, so they will work under pressure for the first 30 years.
Public debt is rising: According to the Department of National Statistics, the debts of families in the United Kingdom are at a record size and the British spend an average of 900 more than they earn each year.
However, is it worth worrying about these frightful statistics?
Is age-long debt simply a new common way of life for young adults (and society as a whole)?
An example of this is cars, which are another major purchase purchased by purchasing a home (if such a success smiles).
Auto Trader predicted this week that in a decade all new cars would be bought on installment basis, a common method of vehicle acquisition.
Jeannie Boyle, director of EQ Investors and a certified financial planner, believes that expectations have really changed.
"It's really normal nowadays to have debts: credit cards, interest-free refinancing, student loans and quick loans have become popular," she said.
"It was a shame for our generation of grandparents to have debts."
Today, student debt and housing price debt have become a normal phenomenon.
Moira O'Neill, head of the personal finance division at Interactive Investor, also supports this statement, believing the results may be alarming.
"If you borrow a huge amount that is four or five times your income, it may appear that additional debt will mean nothing," she explained.
And that's how people get into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for years, so people with large loans or other debts have to think about what would happen if rates rise."
It should not be surprising, perhaps, that commentators in the financial industry are not in any doubt.
Brian Brodie, executive director of the loan agency Freedom Finance, says: "Debts are not taboo.
Loan to purchase a home repair or a new car is no longer considered a last resort.
Because of the low interest rates, many people have placed savings on time deposits that yield higher returns, but not as easy to access the money saved.
As a result, the middle class is borrowing more and more.
In the last six months, about half of the new loans have been taken by customers with excellent credit rating."
Richard Haymes, head of financial problem-solving at Equifax's TDX Group, believes that such expectations - not to get out of debt for a lifetime - are really worrying.
He says: "In August, inflation was at its highest in six months (2.7 percent), interest rates rose, and earnings increased little, which is why many people are concerned about the decision to borrow without having a realistic plan to repay their debts.
Our analysis showed that the number of personal bankruptcies will increase by 17 percent this year, with record consumer borrowing as the main determining factor."
Debts may not cause much trouble as long as a person works and earns, but it is unclear how lifelong unpaid debts will affect his well-being in old age.
A study by the Center for Economic and Business Research, together with specialists in lending funds for mortgaged assets from More 2 Life, showed that unguaranteed debts of people aged 55-74 have risen by more than a third in the last four years, more than twice as fast as the national average.
This age group mostly borrows through credit cards and spends 30 percent more each month than they earn.
Boyle added: "More and more people are choosing to pay their debts from pension funds at the age of 55, which will affect their retirement lives.
These are usually the only savings they "had to" save.
In addition, people think that they will pay out later when they use the property, but if they exchange the available property for a cheaper one, they don't get as much money as expected.
If property prices fall, this situation will only get worse."
Naked to half, Serena Williams sang I Touch Myself to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams released a video in which she sings the classic Divinyls song "I Touch Myself" with her hands covered in a naked chest.
A tennis ass shared the video on his Instagram page and explained that he created the video to encourage women to check their breasts themselves.
"This month in the Fight Against Breast Cancer, I recorded a version of The Divinels' global hit I Touch Myself to remind women to check themselves on a regular basis," Williams wrote.
"This is how I came out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because this problem affects women of all races around the world.
The most important thing to identify as early as possible is that it helps save many lives.
I hope I can remind women of that."
Williams continued: "This music video is part of the I Touch Myself Project, which is being implemented in honor of the famous Chrissy Amphlett - she died of breast cancer and gave us her hit to remind women to take care of their health first."
The project, supported by the underwear brand Berlei for Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA), started in 2014 after the death of Amphlett, 53.
The video, which the tennis star posted on her Instagram account, received more than 1.5 million views and numerous fan praise for how the tennis player sang the song.
"The warmest wishes for this video and your courage to do so.
Thank you, Serena," one fan wrote.
Another added: "Serena, it's AWESOME.
20 years ago I had breast cancer and found the nodule myself, even when mammograms showed nothing.
It is just necessary to check.
Thank you for not being afraid to get out of your comfort zone - you're a real goddess!"
Berlei also released a new snake skin pattern bra, The Chrissy, for the I Touch Myself Project, which was inspired by the rock star.
100 percent of the profits from the sale of the bra will be donated to the BCNA.
When checking for yourself, it is important to know what signs and symptoms need to be looked for.
Signs of breast cancer include not only nodules, but also changes in breast size or shape, rashes or wounds, discharge from the nipples, skin surface pitting, persistent pain or changes in skin texture.
In addition, cancer can be alerted by swelling at the armpit or collarbone, swollen veins and a recessed nipple.
Women are recommended to have their breasts checked monthly.
If any signs of breast cancer are noticed, the NHS recommends that you seek immediate medical attention from a family doctor.
If the family doctor who examined you decides that your symptoms need to be evaluated further, he or she will send you to a breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driver forced the entire SNL filming group to quatotis
Adam Driver was this week's Saturday Night Live guest star and actually made an effort to make everyone laugh.
The show's best jokes are mostly not related to a specific relevant event - as is a new parody titled "Career's Day".
The US high school day is pictured when students bring their dads, and the teenager Mortdecai (Pete Davidson) reluctantly agrees that his father, the old oil magnate Abraham H. Parnassus, would give a speech.
Parnassus, whose megalomanic personality may have been inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis' character Daniel Plainview from the film There Will Be Blood, vividly recounts how he took control of the oil industry.
"I was born seven months too early," Parnassus tells the students.
"Incubator technology had just been invented, so I was put in a cast-iron pot and heated in a pizza oven until I learned how to walk.
My bones never hardened, but not my spirit!
Be strong and crush your enemies!"
Davidson and his fellow SNL actress Aidy Bryant, who plays a teacher, barely keep up without laughing and cannot look the Driver in the eye.
However, the "Star Wars" actor's jokes are only getting run-in and he begins to tell of a personal war with another oil magnate, H. R. Pickins.
"I married your granddaughter!" he yelled.
"I've filled her belly with my purulent seed and ruined your boy - that's my ultimate revenge, H. R."
Parnassus became the same memorable Adam Driver character in less than five minutes as Kylo Ren of the two films.
"Be damned, H. R."
Songs by Kendrick Lamar leaked: Eight unheard tracks have appeared on the Internet
A number of unreleased songs by Kendrick Lamar appear to have been leaked.
On Saturday, eight still-unheard tracks spread online, with parties sung by SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Abis Soulas.
It is unclear where the songs came from, and the title of the collection "Bad Kid Chill City EP" and the cover illustration (which was most likely created by a fan) are not official.
It is possible that only demo and incomplete versions of the songs have been leaked, sounding as if they were recorded at different stages of Lamar's career.
"Gang Member" could belong to the era of Good Kid Maad City, and "Heroin", sung with SZA, more like the soundtrack "DAMN./Black Panther".
The following songs are distributed in the set:
"Gang Member";
"The Only Nigga";
"Want In Life";
"Loved Ones" (with SZA);
"Own This City";
"Heroin (with SZA, Jay'umi Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Ab Soul)";
"Look Over Your Shoulders" (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
"Swimming Pools Alternate".
The Independent contacted Kendrick Lamar's representative for a comment.
Confusion over musical "Chicago": No tickets left in Klaipėda, invites you to go to Vilnius or Kaunas
The Lithuanian desire to see the Klaipėda State Musical Theatre musical "Chicago" - does not subside.
For this reason, perhaps the most popular Lithuanian musical of all time set out on another tour through the country's largest arenas.
However, about 1.5 months before the shows, the halls begin to lack seats.
Organizers announce that all tickets to the musical have already been sold at the Klaipėda Švyturys Arena, and tickets for performances in Kaunas Žalgiris and Vilnius Siemens arenas are rapidly melting.
There have been no tickets in the port city for some time now, so anyone who wants to see this indifferent musical is welcome to go to Kaunas or Vilnius, where tickets are still a little bit.
The performances will take place in December, so when you come from further away, you will not only see our musical, but also have a great opportunity to look at the Christmas trees of the largest cities in the country," Laima Vilimienė, the head of Klaipėda State Theatre, suggests to the fans of the musical.
In December, the audience of "Chicago" will be greeted by a slightly changed composition of artists.
One of the main roles of the musical is first entrusted to actor Thomas Lightning.
A talented and well-known actor from TV screens in Chicago will embody the inimitable Billy Flynn - Chicago's best and most influential lawyer, who changes people's destinies without scruples.
Since the Klaipėda State Musical Theatre's musical "Chicago" is adapted for larger spaces, arenas, the formation of artists appearing in it is also larger than that of the work shown on Broadway.
Nearly half a hundred artists appear in the Lithuanian "Chicago".
The main roles of women were entrusted to the charming soloist of Klaipėda State Musical Theatre Beata Ignatavičiūtė (killer Velma Kelly) and the charismatic soloist of Kaunas Musical Theatre Gabriele Bielskyte (killer Roxie Hart).
The musical "Chicago" depicts the Chicago criminal world of the 1920s, which turns the prison walls into a star hill.
It is a musical satire of criminal justice that tells of two killers seeking attention and recognition.
The musical is permeated with sexuality and irony.
No matter where or what the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - do, the meaning of life is to shine with a shining star.
Their life is life because of the message on the front page, because of the headline, the glitter, the alley of fame...
On 13 December, "Chicago" will be shown at Švyturys Arena in Klaipėda, on 18 December - at Žalgiris Arena in Kaunas, on 20 December - at Siemens Arena in Vilnius.
Tickets are distributed by "Tiketa".
Living room furniture in Kaunas
The site can be called a representative home area, where we spend time with friends, receive guests, etc. Therefore, it should be installed in a way that is convenient not only for the owners of the apartment or house, but also for guests.
Depending on the size of the site, the walls, ceiling decor, and the taste of the hosts, appropriate furniture should be selected.
The living room should not only be beautiful, but also comfortable.
It is best to call an interior designer for help, who will help to optimally fill the space so that it is not overloaded or vice versa - too empty.
It is advised to first set the main point of the site, i.e. the item to which you will combine furniture, other details.
It can be a fireplace or another important highlight of the interior of the living room.
The living room would also be great for creating a chat space where guests can communicate comfortably so that they are not disturbed by furniture not in place, etc.
Sofas, chairs should be placed close to each other so your guests can sit down and talk.
Thus, the arrangement of furniture must encourage communication, unite people, and not distance them from each other.
Do not push furniture against the wall.
Depending on the size of the room, it depends on what distance should be from the walls.
Although the room is small, still leave at least some space from the wall, do not push furniture near it.
If the room space is large, leave even more space away from the walls.
Indeed, the greater the distance, the better.
Set up furniture to create balance
Consider the size and location of the various details that will be on your site.
All elements must be in harmony with each other.
The living room furniture must be in harmony with the interior details.
A small contrast is possible.
It will enliven the interior of the living room, but it should not be too large, as the interior will become tasteless.
We advise you to always consult with interior designers.
By creating the interior of the living room yourself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you risk going to extremes: or you will create a boring interior because you will be afraid to experiment, make mistakes, make inappropriate choices, or overdo it by improvising.
Proper lighting
This is an extremely important thing.
After all, different light reveals space differently.
Lighting must be arranged at various levels: ceiling lamps, wall lamps, and floor-mounted lamps.
Prosecutor's office appealed acquittal to LKF leaders
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office appealed the acquittal of the Vilnius Regional Court to the former heads of the Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF).
According to the prosecutor's office on Monday, the complaint indicated that the Panevėžys City Municipality had no legal basis to contribute with monetary funds to the reconstruction of the private hotel in Panevėžys.
A pre-trial investigation found that in order to find the opportunity to finance the reconstruction of the hotel, a service public purchase and sale agreement was concluded in 2010 between the Lithuanian Basketball Federation and the Panevėžys City Municipality.
Prosecutors say that the services that the federation had to provide to the Panevėžys City Municipality under the said contract were not intended or could not be provided, as state and sponsor funding had already been received or provided for the intended services, part of the scheduled events had already taken place before the contract was signed and had already been paid from other funds, and part of the events had already taken place after the VAT invoicing - money was transferred according to the invoices for events that had not yet taken place.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office says it disagrees with the ruling of the court of first instance, emphasising the conclusion that the state itself obliged and commissioned the Panevėžys City Municipality to undertake the reconstruction of a private hotel, since there was no state obligation regarding a specific hotel, only a expressed proposal to the Panevėžys City Municipality to resolve the issues of development of hotels necessary for the championship as soon as possible.
In the opinion of the prosecutor's office, the court unreasonably stated that the heads of the LKF and Panevėžys municipality tried to fulfill the state's obligation without having the rightful ways to do so, as the data in the case shows that there was an opportunity to organize European Basketball Championship group matches in other cities without violating the law.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office, on appeal, requests the acquittal of the court of first instance to be overturned and, in this case, to accept a new - conviction - judgment against seven natural persons and one legal person.
On October 15, the Vilnius Regional Court fully acquitted Mindaugas Balčiūnas, the secretary-general of the LKF, of all incriminating crimes.
This case concerns preparation for the European Men's Basketball Championship held in Lithuania in 2011.
Balčiūnas was charged with abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The prosecutor's office accused M. Balčiūnas of having agreed with the chief financial officer and executive director of the federation during his tenure as General Secretary of the LKF to write down acts of performance of works that do not correspond to reality on behalf of the federation - transmissions and other forged financial documents and accounts of services allegedly provided to the Panevėžys municipality by the LKF.
According to the data of the pre-trial investigation conducted by the officers of the Board of the Special Investigation Service (STT) Panevėžys, the funds of the Panevėžys City Municipality may have been fraudulently and forgery of documents in favor of the captured LKF and later used for the reconstruction of the hotel "Romantic" of the company "Via Unica".
Dalia Kuklierienė, the manager of this hotel, has been charged with bribery - she is suspected of giving Balčiūnas a TV as a bribe.
All those convicted with Mr Balčiūnas have been acquitted.
The charges in this case were brought against eight natural persons and one legal person - the Lithuanian Basketball Federation.
A remote workplace is like a Bermuda Triangle
The number of people injured or killed at work in Lithuania has already exceeded the total population of the city of Alytus from 1992 until now and amounts to about 83,000.
If the requirements for a specific physical workplace and its security are somewhat clear, then a kind of new Bermuda Triangle becomes the choice to work remotely - from home, public spaces, or even other countries.
According to insurance specialists, although the Occupational Safety and Health Act provides for the provision of non-distinguishable safety and health conditions to employees working at a distance, a variety of modern forms of work can cause a number of issues, according to a press release.
In the event of an accident in the household, the employer pays for the first two days of unemployment from 80% compensation, and the "Sodra" for the rest of the period.
If an unfortunate event is found to have occurred during work - from the first day of incapacity, "Sodra" compensates 100% of the wages.
When evaluating the statistics provided by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage administered by the BTA, it is obvious that the absolute majority of accidents and various injuries at work occur in the workplace.
In most cases, these are various physical jobs where the risk of injury is greater: careless treatment of devices or equipment, loss of concentration or coordination.
However, the offices, where most of the most marketable, highest-paid specialists are now concentrated, also face their own challenges posed by the freedom of mobility that is given by employers and that is very much loved by employees," says Evgenija Krikščiūnė, Head of the Human Resources Management Division of the BTA.
The legislation in force in Lithuania recommends clearly regulating the duties and responsibilities of the employee, defining the working time, place and functions, and this is also true when forming work remotely.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether the accident occurred during work or not.
Situations and nuances are certainly diverse, with each case being examined individually.
Employees have also often heard of the employer being responsible for, say, going to or from work or travelling to working meetings for accidents that occur.
However, there are a number of nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both employees and employers to initiate conversations, to find out and to make the maximum clear and mutually acceptable record of what situations are really considered accidents at work, and who will already have the status of domestic injuries," the specialist advises.
J. Krikščiūnė states that nowadays, when computer and mobile phone and stable internet connection are often completely sufficient for performing work functions, the employee will not necessarily work at the place and time specified in the agreement.
Employees are mobile, they can choose to work outside the home that day while drinking coffee in a cafe or park while enjoying the sun.
It's going to be a workplace or not?
What if the working hours discussed are not in line with those provided for in the agreement?
There can be really mixed situations, the circumstances of which are helped to be clarified by an ongoing investigation initiated by the "Sodra" or the State Labour Inspectorate," the specialist states.
According to her, in financial terms, the main difference between an event at work and a domestic one is the amount of the incapacity benefit.
J. Krikščiūnė admits that she had to hear unpleasant experiences informally, when employers try to cover up the true circumstances of accidents or injuries and try to persuade employees to turn to doctors outside of work, to take responsibility for themselves, thus hurting financially.
This is an unfair, disrespectful attitude towards the employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the aforementioned mobility of people encourages to look for additional instruments that could help companies in similar situations: it is also the employer's civil liability insurance for damage to employees, the purchase of accident insurance against injury, disability or even death, and also the health insurance is relevant," says J. Krikščiūnė.
The mobile signature system is running again
Following the removal of the fault on Monday, the mobile signature system is running again in Lithuania, and representatives of the Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions, the provider of the service, confirmed to BNS.
This company reported disruptions on Monday morning, inconvenienced by the companies' Bitė, Telia customers and parts of Tele2 users.
Disruptions were also recorded in Estonia, but SK ID Solutions representatives could not comment on the situation in that country.
Lithuanian rugby team - Polish lessons
The Lithuanian rugby team, which debuts in the European "Trophy" division, is still struggling to qualify to higher level rivals.
The "Trophy" division is the third largest in the Old Continent after the Six Nations Tournament and the European Championship.
The 13-18 ranked continental teams compete here.
The Lithuanians started the competition in October with a solid victory in Šiauliai at 30:10 against the Czech team.
And last weekend, the Lithuanian national team stayed in Lodz, where it did not qualify for the Polish national team - 0:33 (0:12).
Although the Lithuanians defended themselves with dedication, they often violated the rules in the struggle and Polish rugby players took the lead in the penalty kicks.
The 3, 10, 27 and 37 minute penalty hits were realized by Wojciech Piotrowicz, giving his own 12 points lead.
In the first half, the Lithuanians had to play without the yellow card of Tautvydas Mažylis for 10 minutes.
In the second half, the guests carried out several attacks, but failed to finish them successfully.
At that time, the Poles managed to break through our defenses.
The ball was pressed in the scoring area by Mateusz Plichta, followed by Krystian Pogorzelski and Mateusz Adamski.
In addition to several important rugby players, the coach of the Lithuanian national team from South Africa Ntando Manyosha recognized the advantage of the rivals and said that such a match provided a lot of valuable experience.
"The Poles played very well and dominated all components of the game.
Our goal was to hold on to this game for as long as possible.
We have just risen to this higher level and we have to get used to it.
We won the first game against the Czechs, but now we met very powerful rivals and we had to recognize their advantage.
The Polish national team has given us useful lessons," said a specialist from South Africa, who has been at the helm of the Lithuanian national team for four years.
Lithuanians will play their next game in the "Trophy" division on 6 April 2019 at home with the Portuguese or Romanians.
Dutch and Swiss teams still compete in this division.
Joseph Blažiūnas became adviser to the Minister of Culture
Joseph Blažiūnas started working as an adviser to the Minister of Culture Liana Ruokytė-Jonsson.
Mr Blažiūnas told the minister on issues of advisory archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage management, the ministry reported.
J. Blažiūnas, who obtained his PhD in the field of art at the Vilnius Academy of Arts, was still director of the Lithuanian Literature and Art Archive, associate professor at the Department of Museology at the Faculty of Communication at Vilnius University.
According to the report, the adviser to the minister is the author of many scientific articles on cultural heritage and the preservation of values.
Japanese coast guard intensively searches for missing island
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - such a name was given to an entire tiny island in the north of Japan in 2014.
A small, meaningless and undeserving island, which was largely unsuitable for life, was of great importance to Japan.
So important that now that it is gone, the area is intensely scouted - maybe there will be more?
Why does Japan need this island so much?
It won't.
Ice and underwater landslides are likely to have taken over this island once and for all, although it has recently been protruding nearly two metres above the surface of the water.
It is almost certain that the island simply broke, but at least traces of it are expected to be found.
When the island disappeared no one knows exactly - it was so worthless that no one did too much of it.
Probably the first to learn about Esanbe Hanakita Kojima's disappearance were Japanese fishermen, who sometimes used the island as an aid to visual navigation.
Its disappearance is not a tragedy even for these fishermen, as there are better ways to catch where to fish, and where the disputed Russian waters begin.
This is exactly what Esanbe Hanakita Kojima meant.
This narrow strip of land was the very western edge of the Kurile Archipelago.
This chain of islands, which Russia refers to as the Kuril Islands and Japan as the Northern Territories.
The conflict with some such breaks has lasted since the middle of the 19th century, but full force has taken hold in the 20th century.
There are natural resources in these areas, but historically Japan also believes the islands should belong to it.
The thing is that the Japanese have been exploring these islands since the middle of the 17th century.
They were the first to make a map, and they undertook more detailed research, registering numerous small islets.
The agreements signed between Japan and Russia in 1855 indicated that Sakhalin was being taken over by the latter and that all Kuril islands were being taken over by Japan.
These two states thus coexisted until 1905, when the Russian Empire lost Sakhalin to Japan in the war.
In 1945, the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened up the Kuril Islands.
Japan, by the way, does not mean major claims to the entire archipelago, although it was the first to be there, but would like to have four islands - Iturup, Kunashi, Shikotan Islands and Chabomay.
Japan feels that it has a historical right, as the islands were explored first, and they were also owned by Japan under the agreements of 1855.
In 2009, Japan offered to share the four islands equally with Russia, but Russia did not even consider accepting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the Northern Territories, but now that the island has disappeared, this geographical connection is as if lost.
That physical marker of Japan's presence in those waters was missing.
This is a major loss, resulting in the search for the island's remains.
However, even when they are found Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not fit the simple definition of an island - it must be land.
This means a slight reduction in Japanese territory and a significant reduction in the Exclusive Economic Zone counted off the coast.
Just wondering what the island search mission is hoping for - after all, it will certainly not be lost or washed away otherwise.
Incredible drama in a duel between Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams
For more than a week, we had to wait for the final verdict of the judges who became the winners of the cross-border meeting between the Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams.
Nine Polish-Lithuanian duels were held in Poland.
Four confrontations were won by Lithuanians, the same number by Poles.
And the outcome of the decisive duel was due to the long-running panel discussions and the final decision of the competition secretariat.
The team meeting began with the victories of Lithuanian boxers.
Multiple Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weight category up to 52 kg) confidently defeated Yakuba Surma by 3:0, soon Edgaras Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) after a persistent fight 2:1 defeated Radomiras Obrušniakas.
Two wins by the hosts followed: Damian Durkacz (up to 64 kg) defeated Manta Dužina by 3:0, while Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) outscored Simon Bani by 2:1.
Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) returned the lead for the Lithuanian national team.
Lithuanian defeated Bartosz Golebiewski by 2:1.
In another fight, Piotr Szczukowkis (up to 81 kg) in the third round beat Eigirdas Kasmočius by a clear margin and the score again became equal to 3:3.
The Jocules brothers were successful in different ways.
Robert Jokulis (up to 91 kg) defeated Andrzej Colton by 3:0, and Arvydas Jokulis (over 91 kg) had to concede Adam Culik's advantage already in the first round.
Most of the discussions were caused by the fight between Tadas Tamašauskas (up to 91 kg) and Michal Soczynski.
It was because of her cross-border meeting that the announcement of the final result took more than a week.
One judge awarded the victory to a Pole, two judges to a Lithuanian, but due to a technical error, the point assigned to a Lithuanian judge was credited to M. Soczynski.
After a long protracted dispute, the victory is left to the Polish boxer - 2:1.
In the meeting of the Lithuanian and Polish national teams, the hosts won the victory with a score of 10:8 (two points are awarded for the victory).
They managed to reciprocate the Lithuanians for the crushing defeat they had suffered in the previous match with each other.
At a 2015 meeting in Marijampole, Lithuanian boxers won as many as five fights out of six and won by a score of 10:2.
The meeting for the leaders of the Lithuanian national team in Poland was a general rehearsal before the Lithuanian Boxing Championship to be held in Šilutė on 14-17 November.
After the national championships, a new Lithuanian boxing team will be formed to defend the country's honour at the World and European Championships next year.
How does a dog determine in terms of footprints which direction a person went in?
You already know that a dog's sense of smell is extremely sensitive.
They can smell hidden explosives, drugs, blood, other animals, and some even recognize diseases by smell.
Traced dogs are also well known in the films, but their work is much harder than you thought.
How do they determine which direction the trail owner went in?
In fact, the issue is much more complex than you think.
Footprint tracking consists of three stages - finding, setting direction and tracking.
The second stage is significantly more difficult than the other two, as it is difficult to decide in which direction a person has taken when reaching the tracks.
After all, there is not a second between different steps, so their smell doesn't differ much, right?
Not quite so.
An Oslo University study published back in 1990 described experiments in which a dog was led to a 90-degree angle to the trajectory that man passed.
Attempts were made on grass and on asphalt.
And in many cases, dogs easily determined the direction of a person's walk, even when he tried to mislead them by passing backwards.
Can you imagine how difficult this task is?
The difference between the smells of adjacent traces is very small and with time it decreases even more.
However, scientists say that this is not so strange - dogs could tell and which part of the foot touched the ground first.
This is because their sense of smell is an incredible tool.
The dog's brain is dominated by areas responsible for the sense of smell (how regions responsible for vision dominate our brain).
The dog's nose has 125-300 million scent receptors.
In general, a dog's sense of smell is at least 40 times more sensitive than that of humans, but their ability to interpret different odors plays an even greater role.
The scientists then conducted similar experiments with footprints left by bicycles, but it was much more difficult for dogs to trace their direction.
This is due to the fact that bicycle cancers are not segmented as trailing human footprints, making it more difficult to isolate different locations for comparison - this is not natural for dogs, so more time is needed.
True, dogs are not the strongest olfactory owners.
This title would most likely go to the bears.
Male white bears follow females ready for mating for hundreds of kilometers, and brown bears smell the pasteurized animal as far as 30 km away.
In private forests promise to regulate cuttings
Environment Minister Kęstutis Navickas will discuss deforestation in the Seimas on Tuesday.
At the end of August there was public discontent over the deforestation in Labanor Regional Park.
The logging of these forests was halted for a month.
The minister has acknowledged that investigations into the crossings in Labanore have shown that no serious violations have been committed.
However, the Ministry of Environment has already imposed some restrictions in light of the task force's proposal to tighten deforestation in state-owned forests.
The minister promises that other legislation to adjust deforestation will be prepared by the end of the year.
The intention is to apply the same restrictions that will apply to cuttings in state forests, and to private forest holdings.
Agnė Jagelavičiūtė revealed strategy as she gathered 170,000 followers
You have to give people what they want and at the same time put in what you want yourself, Agnė Jagelavičiūtė says in the LRT TV show "Culturally with Nomeda".
According to the stylist, this is how she gradually brought together a huge crowd of fans.
"First you hit a person's taste, you drag it to yourself, and over time you drink that taste a little bit," Jagelavičiūtė says.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170,000 followers on her Facebook account - she achieved such a number using a certain strategy: "At first you hit a person's taste, you strain to yourself, over time you drink that taste a little bit".
Stylist A. Jagelavičiūtė says she hates uncertainty, so she shows her face as it is - authenticity and the ability to find the best way of presentation are the most important criteria of popularity in social networks.
She observes that there is no more human culture on social media because a lot of Internet users come to them to fight with someone or read comments from other people who quarrel: "For example, in my teens there was a time when I wanted to chat with everyone and curse - now I don't have that desire anymore".
"The fake life is the worst thing.
And there's a lot of that on social media.
In February, it's still a little less than instagram," she speaks.
A. Jagelavičiūtė, who has an education in interior design and painting, says she is sending a specific message on social media - talking about the emancipation of women.
She also advertises the productions produced by magazines, and sees creation in her work as well.
"I can't say that fashion magazine is an expression of pure art, but I know there's really a lot of it out there.
I believe there is a lot of creativity in my work, just like vanity.
I'm balancing - that's my key to those huge numbers.
I don't want to create a fake life.
It is far better to give people what they want and quietly put in what they want themselves," says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the hardest events to attract young people is classical music concerts.
To increase their popularity, well-known people have suggested through life stories: talking about backstages, failures, and life events thus remaining authentic.
It is this strategy that A. Jagelevičiūtė proposes to apply to the whole culture.
According to her, without hitting anyone, without doing any entertainment and displaying true values, culture has no opportunities.
"Like a boring lecturer before students - is there a chance?
If we can't find some way to present that art, advertise without advertising, it won't work out anyway.
When we are realistic and catch the reader - maybe then something will change.
You catch once, second, third - and already addiction," she shares with insight.
Three people disappeared after a helicopter fell in Lituya Bay north of Juneau
On Saturday, after a helicopter crash north of June, a search for three people began in Alaska.
One person was rescued after Friday's crash, and the other three were unable to be found.
The helicopter crashed near Lituya Bay, northwest of Juneau.
It was found to be an Airbus H125 on a long-distance trip to Grand Prairie, Texas.
The wreckage of the aircraft was found 100 feet off the coast on Friday.
According to the Associated Press, one person rescued was 14 years old.
She was reported to have mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
Two adults and two teenagers were on board the fallen helicopter.
According to the KTVA, David King (53), Josh Pepperd (42) and Andrew Pepperd (11) were missing.
Senior Pepperd was found to be the director of Davis Constructors & Engineers, an Alaskan construction company.
It is unclear what caused the accident.
The National Transportation Safety Council has stated that an investigation has been launched.
"I'm going to crash a helicopter that was brand new - just got from the factory, two adults and two teenagers were flying," the Coast Guard said in a statement, according to the KTVA.
The pilot was found to have 40 years of experience flying fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, including flights in Alaska.
According to the Anchorage Daily News, family friend Jeff Brodsky said relatives "have not yet lost hope of a miracle."
With the help of a Coast Guard helicopter, rescuers resumed their search for experienced climbers missing on 17 February 2016 on Mount Nevis in Fort William, Scotland.
On Saturday, three people were searched in Alaska for missing after a helicopter crash.
"I have experienced sexual violence"
Presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway revealed the sexual violence she suffered on Sunday morning.
Conway commented on the fierce controversy between Judge Brett Kavanaugh running for Supreme Court and his accuser, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
Conway excitedly revealed that she herself had experienced sexual violence, and defended Kavanaugh against presenter Jake Tapper by claiming that the judge had been accused of sexual abuse while ignoring facts unfavorable to the charges.
"I have a great deal of sympathy for the victims of sexual abuse and violence.
I have experienced sexual abuse myself," Conway said on CNN's Sunday show State of the Union.
"I am a victim of sexual violence and I don't think Judge Kavanaugh, Take Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for that.
We must be responsible for our own behaviour."
Conway said the news network must be ashamed of Kavanaugh's comparison to Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to three to ten years in a Pennsylvania state prison last week.
Conway also criticized the Senate Judiciary Committee for failing to remove former President Bill Clinton, who had engaged in oral sex in his office and lied to the people of the United States.
The survey showed that Kavanaugh's and Ford's testimony divided the U.S. public
Americans disagree on the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford - the accuser claims the judge sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers.
The number of people who think Ford or Kavanaugh are lying is almost the same: 38 percent of those polled say that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying when giving testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Judiciary Committee heard both parties when Ford sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein detailing the charges against the judge.
After the letter was made public, both Ford and Kavanaugh said they were ready to speak before the committee.
When giving testimony, Ford said he was 100 percent sure that she was being attacked by Kavanaugh, not another person, at a party in the early 1980s.
In an emotional opening speech, a 51-year-old woman said she felt a civic obligation and therefore could not remain silent.
"I'm very scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think it's my civic duty to tell what happened to me when Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school."
Kavanaugh, who denied allegations of sexual abuse by Ford and two other women, said he "never sexually assaulted anyone in high school, college, or any time later."
"Everybody tried their best to find someone to prevent me from voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic or disgusting," he said.
"It's just slander at the last minute."
The results of a poll conducted by YouGov on September 27-28, which surveyed 2607 people, are not surprising - opinions of people sympathetic to different parties differed: Democratic supporters believe Ford more (73 percent) and Republicans believe Kavanaugh (74 percent), although Ford believed more Republicans than Kavanaugh's - Democrats (14 percent compared to 11 percent).
The founder of the exhibition "Body Worlds", called "The Doctor Death", wants to be cut and showcased in his own exhibition
The German scientist who invented plastication wants to become an eternal part of his exhibition "Body Worlds" when he dies.
Gunther von Hagens devised an innovative method that provides an opportunity to showcase corpses, skulls and organs in an exhibition that has traveled the world, receiving both admiration and controversy.
A 73-year-old man with cancer fatally ordered his wife to plasticize him after his death to make him a permanent exhibit at the "Body Worlds" exhibition, which will open in London this week.
"In a way, it will be the completion of his life's work.
I now understand that I will have to do it because that is how I will express recognition and love," Angelina Whalley told The Observer newspaper.
She claimed that the man gave strict instructions on what to do with his corpse, and the whole process would take about a year.
Muscles, nerves and arteries must be unwrapped, and silicone should be injected into the body and placed in the right position.
"He said to me, 'Angelina, you can freeze me to -25 degrees Celsius for a year, but after that you'll have to add your hands, otherwise I'll freeze.'
So I'll be able to mourn for a year, then I'll have to take it."
He will then, ideally by wearing a soft fetric hat inherent in his image, join the exhibition at the London Pavilion alongside other bodies stagnant in time with upright postures, such as riding a horse or playing cards.
Von Hagens became famous in the United Kingdom for performing an autopsy on a live British television broadcast (it was the first public autopsy in 170 years).
More than 47 million people have visited the "Body Worlds" exhibitions around the world since 1995.
Peter Tabernalis, the founder of Body Worlds London, told The Guardian that 100 percent of the exhibit, which covers about 28,000 square feet, was donated by people who "had given their consent because they wanted to help the living, educate them and help see possible problems."
"We see and read so many terrible things that we are terrified of death.
None of it will escape, death is common to all of us, and I think Body Worlds shows you don't have to be afraid," Tabernal said.
Ronaldo's lawyers threaten court action on rape charges
Lawyers for Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo said Friday that a German magazine that published "obviously illegal" American claims that Ronaldo raped her in 2009 would sue her.
One of Ronaldo's lawyers, Christian Schertz, said in a statement that the Der Spiegel magazine article was an "unacceptable statement of private charges" and that he would seek legal redress for the magazine for his client.
A statement was sent to Reuters by Ronaldo's representative firm, Gestifute, in response to a request for comment on an article by Der Spiegel published online on Friday.
Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the content of the Der Spiegel statement, which Reuters could not independently verify.
Der Spiegel first filed charges in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world, Ronaldo won the title of the best player in the world five times.
This summer, he moved to Italian Juventus from Real Madrid; the Italian club declined to comment on Der Spiegel's statement.
The magazine reports that the alleged rape occurred in June 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel room, said Leslie Mark Stovall, a lawyer for the accused Kathryn Mayorga.
Stovall told the magazine that Ronaldo and Mayorga had agreed out of court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality agreement for $375,000 paid by Ronaldo.
Stovall did not immediately respond to Reuters emails for comments, and Mayorga did not respond to calls on the home phone.
However, Stovall told Der Spiegel magazine that he had filed a civil complaint in order to void the confidentiality agreement.
Mayorga told Der Spiegel magazine she thinks the contract no longer binds her because she still feels the consequences of the night nine years ago.
"I've been through serious crises," she told Der Spiegel.
"And yet, the charge of rape.
I blame him and blame myself for signing this."
A Sustainable Business that Ensures Creators Independence
Are you ready to try Self-Publishing 3.0?
The new white paper, published today by the Independent Creators Union on #selfpub3.0, explains for the first time in detail how to join other business developers, become independent and start a sustainable creative business.
Orna Ross, founder of the Independent Creators' Union, who has not been recognized as one of the 100 most influential people in publishing for the first time, will explain at the Digital Book World 2018 conference why creators should publish Self-Publishing 3.0 methods.
"Consumer trends, such as increasing popularity of personal brands, responsible consumption and reading on mobile phones, combined with digital publishing technologies, create an extremely favourable environment for developers' businesses," says Ross.
However, only independently and creatively minded and power-aware creators who understand the value of intellectual property can take advantage of these opportunities.
#selfpub3.0 encourages developers to create multiple sources of earnings through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
It is possible to earn from direct sales, subscription models, crowdfunding, wide dissemination models and other sources of revenue, such as online training and the activities of a related entity.
#selfpub3.0 also promotes the distribution of books in a wide variety of formats to the widest possible audience through the use of retailers and other services.
The main goal of #selfpub3.0 is to encourage change of mindset and learn how to manage your creative business, so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative asset, is not recklessly transferred to another company, such as a specialist publishing house or an independent publishing service provider.
According to Ross, this is how creators can increase their income, influence, and impact, and not only every creator of the digital age, but also publishers, must be interested in these methods; she also stressed that true independence of creators (like other people) is guaranteed by commercial and creative freedom.
The future is here.
And its prospects for independent developers are now at their best.
The book Self-Publishing 1.0 describes computer publishing and printing on demand.
The theme of Self-Publishing 2.0 is the sale of e-books for readers and phones in online book stores.
Now begins a new era of Self-Publishing 3.0, in which independent publishers will be trained to start a viable and sustainable business.
The Independent Creators Union is the only global non-profit organization that unites writers who publish independently books.
The goal of the Union is to develop the skills of independent publishers, to promote ethical activities, to help novice creators sell books and to encourage creators to conduct a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
Presidents of the country and the central bank warned the Italian government about the planned deficit
After hearing plans by the populist government to raise deficit spending significantly next year, the Italian president and the head of the central bank warned on Saturday that the country's debt must be contained.
The ruling parties (the opposition Five Star Movement and the right-wing Northern League) put forward a 2019 deficit proposal late Thursday that would see the deficit reach 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and three times the previous administration's target.
This announcement on Friday disrupted the market and spurred the sale of bonds and dealt a blow to bank shares.
In addition, such plans are not aligned with the European Union, which applies and oversees EU fiscal rules.
Addressing an audience in the presidential palace commemorating the constitution's 70th anniversary, President Sergio Mattarella mentioned that under the country's framework laws, "the budget must be balanced and the debt must be contained."
"We will protect our citizens' savings in this way," he said.
At a conference in central Italy a little later, Ignazio Visco, the president of the Bank of Italy, said that there could be no further increase in the country's debt, which is the largest of all the major economies of the European Union and reaches 131 percent of GDP.
"Italy must prioritise public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt," said Visco, according to state news agency Ansa.
"Debt must be reduced consistently."
Northern League leader and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini responded to Mattarella's words that the debt had risen due to years of tough demands from Brussels.
"Calm down, Mr. President," Salvini said in a statement.
"The public debt has bloated due to the budgets imposed by Europe for years. In the end, we are changing plans and striving for a better future and growth."
Even earlier, before Mattarella or Visco spoke, the leader of the Five Star Movement, Luigi Di Maio, said that money stolen earlier would be returned to the people" from the budget, but added that the government did not seek to contradict the EU or financial markets.
The ruling parties pressed Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, who was not affiliated with any group, to approve their planned deficit spending.
Italian media said Mattarella supported Tria's failed attempt to keep the budget deficit below 2 percent of GDP.
The presidents of the country and the central bank do not directly influence economic policy.
The 77-year-old president can reject the law and return it to parliament, but only once.
Parliament can then re-admit the unaltered law and formalize it.
Official information: Indonesian tsunami sensors missed huge waves
Indonesia's geophysics agency cancelled the tsunami warning 34 minutes after its release, and a severe earthquake later struck, sending huge waves towards the northeastern coast of Sulawesi Island, where hundreds of people were killed and thousands were left homeless.
Car wrecks after tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, September 29, 2018.
At least 384 people were killed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu, approximately 1,500 km (940 miles) from Jakarta.
Officials said on Sunday that the death toll was likely to rise.
On Friday, a large number of people gathered for a festival on Palu Beach, which was hit by waves six metres (18 ft) high that killed many at night.
The Geophysics Agency's BMKG received criticism on social media on Saturday, with many people considering whether the tsunami warning was lifted too soon.
The agency said it carried out the standard procedure and decided to cancel the alert based on data from the nearest flood sensor, located about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
"We don't have observation data from Palu.
Therefore, we had to make a decision based on the data we had," said Rahmat Triyono, head of the BMKG Earthquake and Tsunami Center.
The nearest tidal meter measuring sea level changes only found what he said was a "minor" six-centimetre (2.5 in) wave and did not notice giant waves at Palu.
"If we had had a flood meter at Palu or got the data from there, of course, the situation would be better.
We must consider this in the future," Triyono said.
According to officials, the tsunami struck Palu and surrounding areas at a huge speed of hundreds of kilometers per hour, but it is unclear if it occurred before or after the warning was lifted.
Residents inspect corpses on the street in search of their family members after tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, September 29, 2018.
"Based on videos distributed on social media, we believe the tsunami occurred before the warning was officially lifted," Triyono said.
The 9.5 magnitude earthquake that caused the most damage occurred on the second day of Christmas in 2004 and caused a massive tsunami that killed approximately 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, including 126,000 casualties in Indonesia.
The picturesque town of Palu, with a population of 380,000 people, lies at the mouth of a narrow bay in the northeast of Sulawesi Island.
According to Indonesia's National Disaster Reduction Agency (GNPB), tsunamis devastated the city in 1927 and 1968.
According to Baptiste Gombert, a geophysics researcher at Oxford University, the earthquake should not have caused a tsunami.
Friday's earthquake was caused by a horizontal fracture, with adjacent tectonic plates moving horizontally rather than vertically as usual for tsunamis.
"It is believed that there was a landslide at sea that displaced a lot of water and caused a tsunami," he said, adding that a force of waves moving towards the coast could have concentrated in a narrow bay.
Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, told correspondents that his team was "ready to send easy-to-understand public warnings" when the tsunami warning was suddenly lifted.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, text messages with warnings were repeatedly sent to residents, but Nugroho said that due to the earthquake, the area's power and communication lines were cut off and there were no sirens along the coast.
Indonesians on social media questioned whether the GMKG should have cancelled the tsunami warning, and resented that the information was not given in time.
"I am disappointed... The warning has been cancelled... And the tsunami happened anyway..." a Twitter user, Azanoguccy, sent a direct message to BMKG.
Golf: Mollywood duo set to beat ticket sales records
After winning the fours competition on Saturday, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood became the first two from Europe to win in all four pairs of matches, and will likely be recorded in history as they already lead by a score of 10:6 against the Ryder Cup final.
After defeating Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau by a score of 5:4, they became the first European couple to win all four games.
Only Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins were able to do so in 1979.
The crushing results of 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 show not everything.
The pair defeated Woods three times with 14 important titles and won twice against Patrick Reed.
They also won a victory over Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, this week's U.S. team that won the next three games.
Molinari and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five points out of five possible in the Sunday unit competition.
Fleetwood has already earned the most points in the Ryder Cup unit competition as a rookie European.
The pair, who were nicknamed "Mollywood" by a large group of new fans, did not seem to be able to lead the European team forward at first glance.
No such performance is expected from Ryder Cup rookies such as Fleetwood, and Molinari did not win any of the previous six games and landed rivals in four.
However, there was hope: Fleetwood was the first in Europe last year, knows the Le Golf National field as his five fingers and here in 2017 won the French Open tournament and demonstrated a determined temper during this year's U.S. Open.
Molinari is the new British Open champion and is considered by many to be the most consistent ball battering player of the European tournament, a useful feature on a tight field where high grass can lead to destruction, as demonstrated by American failures.
These player traits and harmonious play on the field made them insurmountable.
"I feel a little bit sensuous now, and it's only Saturday," said the resentful Fleetwood, who played all weekend with a broad smile on his face.
We performed well this afternoon, played stable and well.
If we stand together in history, it will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we tried for the team."
Molinari was also cheering.
"It was great to play with Tommy," he said.
"But we have to fulfill our duty, not just get into the record books, so tomorrow we'll have to struggle hard for the 4.5 points we need to win; it won't be easy."
Knight Fever!
Irish village turned into medieval battlefield
Claregalway Castle in the west of Ireland was formerly the main stronghold of a powerful, 15th-century family descended from an English knight and this Saturday was remembered for its origins.
Knights duel with swords during the medieval fighting festival at Claregalway Castle in Galway, Ireland, 29 September 2018.
The courtyard of a completely restored Anglo-Norman period house with a tower has been turned into a medieval battleground, where numerous enthusiasts from all corners of the world have restored to detail the contact fights and games that were popular centuries ago.
Knight-dressed Karl Dornan and Celtic soldier's suit-wearing Donna Dornan patrol the Great Hall of Claregalway Castle during a medieval fighting festival in Galway, Ireland, September 29, 2018.
"It's a great weekend outing and something unusual," said Denise Fitzgerald of Kerry County, who had become a tavern hostess for the weekend, while roasting vegetables in oil on a campfire flame.
"We went back to the simplest things.
I'm trying to do everything as needed," said the theatre worker, who is participating in an armed struggle festival for the first time.
There were authentically armored fighters competing outside, and although their swords were blunt, some helmets were folded, and one injured his lip.
The riders demonstrated their skills by riding and cutting cabbage and eggplant in half.
Nearby metal castings spun guns, spice merchants prepared medicine, and artisans spun and dyed wool.
Serious and handsomely dressed participants tried to empathize with the roles.
"I think anyone can put on a costume, but getting into a role is an art," said Helena Stackpoole, who played Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald and had a unique opportunity to use her knowledge of fashion design.
"All the costumes are hand sewn.
I've been sewing my belt for two years now, and now I'm sewing a dress and I've sewed 800 pearls by hand on her sleeves alone.
It matters to me," she said.
Death toll in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami rises to 832
According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, the death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami on Sulawesi Island rose to 832 on Sunday, and the affected area is larger than originally thought.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference that many people were trapped in the wreckage after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused a six-metre (20 ft) high tsunami wave.
FBI appeals to second woman to accuse candidate Kavanaugh
FBI agents investigating the case of candidate for U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh appealed to a second woman who accused him of sexual assault, a statement this woman's lawyer revealed on Sunday.
A report by Deborah Ramirez's attorney John Clune said the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh's case would not only cover the separate charges of attempted rape filed this week by Federal Court of Appeals judge conservative Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a dramatic Senate hearing.
Ramirez accuses Kavanaugh of showing her her penis at a party where she was drunk and which took place at Yale University's dormitory when they were both studying there.
U.S. President Donald Trump succumbed to pressure from moderate Senate Republicans and ordered an FBI investigation after Thursday's Senate hearing in which Professor Ford of the University of California made detailed accusations that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at a party held in 1982, when they were both in school and were teenagers.
NBC News reported Saturday that the White House had limited the scope of the FBI investigation.
Trump denied this and posted a tweet saying, "I really want them to question all the people they need at their discretion."
White House spokesman Raj Shah said the Senate had determined the extent and duration of the FBI investigation (the investigation must be completed within a week).
"The White House allows agents to do what they are taught," Shah said.
UK will not abandon environmental or animal protection standards after Brexit
Environment Minister Michael Gove said on Sunday that the UK would not abandon environmental or animal protection standards to allow trade deals after Brexit.
Michael Gove, British Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs arrives at Downing Street in London, 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conservative Party conference event, Gove said it was in the UK's interest to be known for its quality foods and the government would announce a strategy for food this year.
Europe reclaims Ryder Cup in unit competition
Francesco Molinari earned fame on Sunday by returning the Ryder Cup to Europe: the Italian defeated Phil Mickelson at hole 16 and earned the point that helped to achieve the required 14.5.
Mickelson surrendered at the pit, releasing the first ball into the water, and having managed to stay on the roll pitch, Molinari became the first European to win all five games in a week, although he did not win any of the previous six.
Europe's victory was already assured that the Italian released the kick from the starting ground and the continent's victory lacked one point, and Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia took the lead in the match and had secured at least half a point each.
At the start of the day, they took the lead with a score of 10:6 and had to score four and a half points out of a possible 12 to regain the trophy and establish their domination of the house, continuing since 1993.
Prior to that, the team only managed to eliminate the four-point difference twice and win the unit competition: this was done by the U.S. team in 1999 in Brooklyn and Europe in the 2012 "Medina Miracle", but no one expected another stunning comeback.
Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson and Tony Finau gave Jim Furyk's team hope by winning the first games, but then European team points poured over the entire field.
Thorbjorn Olesen defeated Jordan Spieth, and his teammate rookie Jonas Rahm defeated Tiger Woods: the athlete who won 14 important titles lost four times out of four.
Ian Poulter, recognized as the best player in the Ryder Cup, received perhaps the most ovations this week when the world's best player, Dustin Johnson, landed him on the 18th lap and brought Europe closer to victory.
Then it was just to wait for which match would end first, and it was the Molinari game that caused a wave of cheer in the crowd that was the biggest in the event's history.
RT World News: German police guarding Erdogan used neo-Nazi name as code word
According to local media, secret officials in eastern Germany used the name of the infamous neo-Nazi extremist who protected Turkish President Erdogan during his visit to Berlin this week.
The regional interior ministry said that the criminal police of the Land of Saxony in eastern Germany were investigating two members of the elite anti-terror squad, the SEC.
The men were meant to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his long-awaited trip to Germany.
Officers had to work in secret, so they had to use a code name according to the protocol.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, an infamous neo-Nazi who was part of the National Socialist underground (NSU) extremist group that killed eight immigrants from Turkey, one Greek citizen and a German police officer at the beginning of this century.
Local media reports that a strange code name was discovered when two policemen requested permission to access internal documents needed to complete the task.
The commanding officers did not delay and recalled the policemen.
Saxon criminal police chief Petric Kleine was the first to respond to the news.
He said the decision to use Boehnhardt's name was "probably the dumbest" and thus "obviously ignored by the victims and their loved ones".
Saxon Interior Minister Roland Woller supported the statement, calling the decision "disgusting, terrible and totally unacceptable".
Erdogan's visit to Berlin on Friday caused much controversy in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has been criticised for accepting a leader accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said the visit was "very important, because in the event of disagreements, they need to be dealt with through a personal meeting."
The public first heard about the NSU in 2011, when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his accomplice Uwe'e Mundlos were discovered in a burning trailer in eastern Germany.
It is believed that one of them killed the other and then committed suicide after a failed attempt to rob a bank in the city of Eisenach.
A third member of the neo-Nazi group, the last surviving Beate'a Zschaepe, was soon arrested as well.
In July of this year, a German court sentenced her to life in prison for 10 counts of murder.
She denied complicity in the murders, but her lawyer said the accused felt moral guilt because she had not tried to stop the murders.
After the NSU scandal, German security agencies received much criticism.
Lawyers, activists, and relatives of victims believe the group had many more associates.
It also became clear that the German domestic intelligence agency BfV had infiltrated many informants into the NSU and was constantly hampering investigations into the murders, attempted murders and robberies associated with the group.
Musk quits as Tesla CEO and will have to pay $20 million fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elon Musk agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which sued him for Twitter fraud, in which he said he would make Tesla a private company.
Musk will have to step down as manager, but the CEO will remain.
The agreement documents state that Musk must step down as chairman of Tesla's board of directors within 45 days and will be barred from returning to the position for three years.
In addition, he will have to pay a $20 million fine.
It all started with a Twitter message that was too careless or intentionally written misleadingly, so Musk will have to get approval in advance before saying or announcing anything about Tesla "in any format, including, but not limited to, posts on social media (such as Twitter), the company's website (such as the company's blog), press releases, and calls to investors."
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million as it did not check Musk's initial Twitter message.
In a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk is accused of misleading investors with a Twitter message dated August 7, in which he said he had found funds to make Tesla a private company worth $420 per share, resulting in a higher price for the company's securities by more than 10 percent.
Musk soon withdrew his words stating that Tesla would remain in public, angering investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that Musk's original statement "was incorrect and misleading because it did not refer to the facts."
Musk himself explained in a blog post that this error could be justified: after meeting with a representative of the Saudi Independent Assets Fund, he had the impression that he had managed to agree on the funds.
Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission had reportedly come close to a softer penalty, with Musk only having to give up his chairmanship for two years and not having to plead guilty, but Musk on Thursday turned down the deal.
On Friday, the price of Tesla's securities fell, and it was likely because of this that he changed his mind again and agreed to stricter terms.
However, under the new agreement, like the old one, Musk does not have to plead guilty to misleading investors.
Patriarch of Alexandria pledged to support the canonical Ukrainian church and urged Orthodox to unite
Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria stated his support for the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church, part of the Moscow Patriarchate.
He spoke in response to the separation of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
Theodore II arrived in Odessa in the south of Ukraine on Thursday and met with the highest representatives of the church and Orthodox believers.
The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected Orthodox hierarchs, descending only to the ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
"I have come to tell you: do not abandon the orthodox faith and the canonical church," Patriarch Theodore II said in an address.
Before his visit to Odessa, he met the Metropolitan Savva of the Polish Orthodox Church, who also supports the canonical Ukrainian church.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to legitimize the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
"We will always support those who seek Orthodox unity," promised Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church has recently gone through a major crisis following the decision of the Patriarchate of Constantinople to recognize the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, also called the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinople decided to send exarchs to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting one orthodox church from interfering in the affairs of another.
Exarchs are special representatives of the Patriarch, formally holding a higher position than Metropolitan Onufry, who is the current head of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Moscow Patriarchate reacted angrily to the actions of Constantinople and cancelled all general church services and memberships in organizations led or co-chaired by representatives of Constantinople.
However, it is argued that by this decision Constantinople was warned not to take other hostile actions and it is not considered that both churches have completely broken ties.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, only one is recognized by other churches, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
Most Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the breakaway churches, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Kiev Patriarchate, which emerged in the 1990s.
This religious movement even has a head, Philaret, who has declared himself patriarch, seeking official recognition of the Orthodox Church, full independence and equality with the Patriarchate of Moscow.
Damascus opened Syria-Jordan's main trade crossing for the first time in three years
According to state news agency SANA, the Syrian government said it would open a crossing of the Nasib border border that borders Jordan, which was closed for three years due to hostilities in the area.
This can be done because militants on the Syrian side have abandoned land near the city of Daraa.
Nasib is the most important trade link not only between neighboring countries, but also between Lebanon and the Persian Gulf.
Highlights from Lavrov's UN speech
While visiting the UN, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attacked the West for "political blackmail and brute force" and said diplomacy must not yield to dictatorship and unilateral sanctions.
The minister at the UN General Assembly said on Friday that some Western countries were putting pressure on others in an attempt to maintain "the positions of world leaders that they have assigned themselves" without remorse.
He did not name specific countries, but said they use "political blackmail, economic pressure and brute force".
The world must pay a high price for the self-interested ambitions of a small group of countries.
Lavrov, who represented Russia at the UN for a decade, said at the meeting that the culture of diplomacy and negotiation is being replaced by a dictatorship and unilateral sanctions imposed without the approval of the UN.
The minister said that sanctions against many countries were "illegal or ineffective" and recalled the US blockade on Cuba over the years.
"But history has not taught us anything," Lavrov said, adding that "Western proponents tend to impose blame solely if it is "very likely".
We remember how often such unfounded accusations justified interference and wars, such as the 1999 bombings in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 interference in Libyan affairs."
Of course, Lavrov did not mention all Western invasions and recalled Syria's seven-year war as one of the latest cases.
The failed attempt by extremists to overthrow the Damascus regime may have been disastrous for the entire country and opened up opportunities for the establishment of a "terrorist caliphate".
Lavrov praised the Astana peace process, which was started jointly by Russia, Turkey and Iran, and said that the process helped prevent the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as ISIS) and other groups that wanted to capture all of Syria.
The most important thing now is to rebuild the war-torn areas of the country and help refugees safely return home.
Lavrov returned to the struggle of the great powers and said the UN was actually founded "after learning from World War II".
Russia's foreign minister recalled that 2018 marks 80 years since the signing of the "shameful" Munich Agreement in 1938, by which France and Britain agreed to allow the Nazis to annex the German-populated part of Czechoslovakia to appease Hitler.
Although then British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said that the Munich Agreement would "bring peace to this time", the war began a year later.
"Munich's betrayal" shows how far "the egoism of countries and disregard for international law can lead," Lavrov said.
"The dictatorship and coercion of the colonial era must be put in the archive of history or the trash can."
Moscow believes constructive dialogue can solve all the world's problems, Lavrov said.
"If you have questions or reproaches, sit down and talk, reveal the facts, listen to your colleague's arguments, and try to reconcile interests."
Crislas in a stranger's eye?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are surrounded by haze, and Bibi taps Iran with her finger
Israel's prime minister claimed Tehran had secret nuclear weapons in a speech at the UN General Assembly.
It is possible that Israel, who accuses others, is hiding something on its own.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who likes the "presentation", revealed the news on Thursday, showing photos taken from high ground with places where Iran allegedly holds nuclear materials.
Tehran quickly responded that Tel Aviv would rather take care of its "undeclared nuclear weapons program."
Although Israel never acknowledged (but did not deny) possessing nuclear weapons, the RT journalist Murad Gazdiev tried to find out if Tel Aviv should actually look for the log in his eye.
Scottish Government: No complaints made about Alex Salmond until January
The Scottish government said it had not recorded any complaints about Alex Salmond until January of this year.
The former first minister was charged with two counts of sexual harassment in January, although he strongly denies them.
He was informed of the investigation in March.
Salmond, who resigned from the Scottish National Party, will sue the Scottish government over the anti-complaint process.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first dealt with in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been recorded by January.
A Scottish government spokesman said: "The Scottish government received two complaints about Alex Salmond in January.
We could have ignored them or concealed them.
Previously, the then Deputy First Minister received no complaints about Alex Salmond and, as we have already said, the First Minister first heard about the investigation from Alex Salmond in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legality of our processes and will persist in defending our position.
The Scottish Government will endeavour to obtain as much information as possible within the time available.
However, as we have said, we cannot comment on Mr. Salmond's case at this time for legal reasons."
Alex Salmond's spokesman said: "We will not comment on anything, because our petition against the Permanent Secretary is now being heard at the hearing and we hope that a decision will be made soon.
We'll speak in court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's complaint procedure against Alex is illegal."
Glasgow smash the Dragons with a score of 29:13: Warriors player Lee Jones' spurt
Glasgow reclaimed the winners' title in the Guinness Pro14 by scoring extra points and defeating the Dragons at Scottstoun Stadium, and coach Dave Rennie does not hide his satisfaction, but believes the game could have been more accurate.
After a surprise loss to Southern Kings team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie asked the teams to make an effort and although she was able to score the necessary points to stay at the top of Conference A, the game played in windy and rainy weather was certainly not smooth.
"I think we defended well tonight, we played on the right side of the field and our strategy was good," Rennie said.
"We have to play more accurately and we were able to take advantage of more opportunities.
The conditions were unfavorable.
We have created many opportunities and we are happy about it.
It is necessary to play more accurately, but 40 or 50 points earned today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We won by scoring extra points, but next week we have to try harder to play at home with Zebre and next week with Saracens in Europe."
Although the weather was windy, the Glasgow team started scoring early, but the IOM caught all of Huwo Jones's lost balls, including his catch of Niko Matawalu's internal pass in the left corner.
Disappointment did not last long: left pole Ollie Kebble broke through in the middle in the fourth minute, and Adam Hastings easily caught the throw.
The Dragons reduced the difference when Arwel Robson received a penalty and the midfielder turned the other player over immediately after the 20-minute mark and the Welsh earned a point.
The match followed a relatively quiet first half with a nearly half-hour mark: Glasgow quarterbacks consistently attacked the Dragons line, then a South African judge, Stuart Berry, fined the Welshmen for offside guarding Hastings' side in the 22nd minute.
The Warriors went into a fight, but lost the ball after a smooth pass, as the left edge of Matawalu, which received a few hits, could not control the ball and it was passed to the left.
A second attempt was made two minutes after the interval: Hastings broke the Dragons line and cleverly handed the ball to Lee Jones, who had let go.
The ball was returned to Hastings in his position and the score in the middle of the match was 12:6.
Glasgow was very successful in the first minute of the second half: the ball of the fallen Alex Dunbar was caught by Lee Jones for the second attempt, and helped by Hastings.
However, the Warriors didn't give up after the failure - just four minutes later, they took over the ball in the middle of the field and the Dragons center Adam Warren drove it under the gate, thus earning points, and later took over by Josh Lewis after an open game with Robson.
The Warriors quickly returned to the leading position and scored extra points in the 54th minute after the fourth attempt when Huwas Jones ran right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (which was the third failure of four attempts).
Glasgow maintained a comfortable higher position and made their fifth attempt a few minutes before, with Dunbar passing the ball after a fight with George Horne, and Hastings scoring.
Kebble was named the best player of the match, but Rennie praised Hastings.
"They obviously prevented us from playing, but we're in the middle of a rip-off," the coach said.
"He ran out of a few meters, but he was slippery and still managed to get away.
He's in good shape and confident in himself."
Ayr United defeated Morton with a score of 1:5: five-star Ayr smashed the host team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore each scored two goals, and Declan McDaid added another and thus helped Ayr stay at the top of the championship table.
Ayr stepped forward after Shankland's goal, scored from six yards after Michael Rose's corner kick for McDaid.
Morton equalized the score in the 35th minute in the first attempt when Charlie Telfer took the ball away from the hesitating Robbie Crawford on his own pitch and sent it through Ayr goalkeeper Ross Doohan to the far edge with a low kick.
Players from Greenock in the fourth minute of the second quarter had a chance to advance when Doohan knocked down Gary Oliver, but Michael Tidser released a weak penalty kick that the goalkeeper easily caught.
The Ayr outlasted the rivals for a second time in the 74th minute when an alternate Craig McGuffie's long-range pass was hit in the air and was sent to the gate by another alternate player, Craig Moore, after falling to the ground.
Moore handed the ball to Shankland the same minute, who scored 17 goals this season.
As the fans raged, Moore returned to his side fourth from the edge of the pitch, and McDaid sent the rebound to the gate.
Alloa and Falkirk's game ended with a 0:2 score: the first youth victory in the league
"I'm happy, I'm relieved, I'm happy," cheered Ray McKinnon after a much-needed first Falkirk victory in the league and earned points for the season.
Rangers borrowed quarterback Zac Rudden (18 years old) scored a goal in both quarters and pushed the host team Alloa Athletic to the bottom of the championship and freed the club from pressing troubles.
"It was an important game for us," McKinnon admitted.
"We probably deserved more in the last three games, so it was great to score three points in a stressful situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It wouldn't have led to anything, but it was important for us to win."
Rudden sent the ball to Patrick Brough in the 26th minute and scored from the gate line in the middle of the second half as Diamond Petravičius slowly kicked the ball over goalkeeper Neil Parry.
"We wanted to defend ourselves firmly but failed," Wasps chief executive Jim Goodwin admitted.
Hearts fans petition for semi-finals received more than 11,000 signatures
The Hearts fans' petition for the Betfred Cup semi-final schedule was signed by more than 11,000 people.
The fans are angry about the decision to hold both semi-finals on the same day and in the same stadium.
Advised by the Scottish police, the SPFL decided last week to host the Aberdeen Rangers playoff game at 12:00 p.m., and Hearts at Celtic at 7:45 p.m., thus provoking the fury of both the Jambos and Dons fans.
The Evening News, along with the Aberdeen Evening Express, jointly requested a fair solution for fans on Saturday.
The so-called "Super Saturday" decision was condemned by both Aberdeen and Hearts: both clubs issued statements criticizing the schedule.
On Thursday, a petition was published on the website change.org requiring one of the matches to be moved to another location or date.
Man charged with stabbing two women in Kent village
Two women in their sixties and eighties died at the crime scene.
According to a police spokeswoman, another man, also over the age of 70, has been hospitalized and is in stable condition.
The 28-year-old, who lives on the same street, remains in custody and will face trial on Monday for two murders and one attempted murder at a Medway magistrates court hearing in which he will be present by video link.
Police have not yet identified the victims, but believe they knew the suspect.
Neighbors said they were shocked by an event in the village that they said was "quiet and friendly".
The 31-year-old Sophie Moorey-Brown told the Press Association: "We've been living here for five years and have never heard of any bad happenings - it's always very quiet and nice to live here."
The Royal Archives and the creators of the musical "Hamilton" will shine a light on the world about King George III
When the Queen presented the project that opened the vast archive of documents accumulated during the reign of George III, it was hoped that letters, diaries and speeches would help the public to know the king considered crazy much better.
Now these documents will reach a different audience - the Royal Archives decided to cooperate completely unexpectedly with the Westend musical.
Academics wishing to reveal the king's true face invited the actor playing "Hamilton" George III to the Windsor Palace Library to review the most important documents from the reign of the Queen's great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.
Researchers are trying to make old manuscripts accessible to a wider audience, so a large crowd of performance fans will be able to access digital documents.
Members of the royal family have already publicly supported the creation of the musical, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will watch the performance twice, although Prince Harry's ancestor is regularly parodied on stage.
Michael Jibson, who plays King in the Westend, said the documents made one think and helped to get to know the king, whose image was shaped for the audience by the musical "Hamilton", the film "The Madness of King George" and the series for children "The Horrible Stories".
"We fell in love after beautiful letters"
US President Donald Trump did not name enthusiasm after an attempt to ease tensions with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and said at a meeting of his supporters on Saturday that they had "fallen in love" after correspondence.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim said they would seek nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula, something they discussed at an unprecedented meeting that took place in Singapore this year.
Before moving into a new phase in history after years of public controversy, the leaders of the countries exchanged threats and insults as North Korea wanted to develop a nuclear missile capable of reaching the United States.
"I was tough, just like him.
We kept talking," Mr. Trump said at a meeting in West Virginia.
"And then we fell in love, you know?
Indeed, he wrote me beautiful, brilliant letters."
Lekavičius and "Panathinaikos" made it to the Greek Cup semi-finals
Athens Panathinaikos celebrated victory in the quarter-finals of the Greek Cup without the greater efforts of Lukas Lekavičius.
The Athens team went on to score 76:68 (29:24, 17:15, 15:11, 15:18) to beat the Patras Prometheus team.
The Lithuanian spent 14 minutes in the field, scored 4 passes (2/2 doubles), rebounded one ball and made one effective pass and broke twice.
Nick Calathes, who scored 15 points, was the most successful player in the Panathinaikos ranks.
Skvernel's accent on Šimonytei: everything was decided by the party's "cream"
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis says that there was a lack of democracy in the Conservatives' internal elections, and the party's leadership actually appointed Ingrida Šimonytė as the presidential candidate.
"The celebration of 'democracy' itself was nevertheless strange, to say the least, when the party cream, the apex decided and actively supported one candidate.
There was probably no chance for a second candidate to win even theoretical," S. Skvernelis told reporters in the Government.
"The Conservatives have appointed their own candidate, and with that we congratulate them," the premier added.
The "State Greens" delegated prime minister said that Šimonytė should be judged by voters who remembered her work in the government of Andrius Kubilius.
S. Skvernelis has not yet commented on whether he will participate in the presidential election himself.
The Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union intends to approve its candidate next year.
Ramūnas Karbauskis, leader of the ruling "Farmers", called the Conservative election a "failed experiment" due to the low turnout of the parties.
"First of all, we need to congratulate the experiment, which absolutely failed.
Only 55% of the party's members participated, with a total of only around 20,000 voters.
Knowing what money had to be spent to organize those elections, it is clear, respectively, that this did not work out," R. Karbauskis told the news portal delfi.lt.
"I think the cost won't justify the result because the result is no, the party has decided that their candidate is like that - it's okay, but to whom to spend so much money," he added.
During the internal elections on the weekend, 79% of the members of the Conservative parity and their supporters voted for I. Šimonytė's candidacy.
Lithuanian salaries make Estonians laugh: one area can change everything
According to the Baltic States survey conducted this year by Baltic Salary Survey, the company that organizes the salary surveys, wages grew the most in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia were not far behind their neighbour, the company said in a press release.
"After surveying 850 companies and examining the changes in remuneration in the Baltic States, we can see that the monthly pre-tax salary grew by 81.8 percent of employees in Lithuania this year and increased by 7.7 percent on average, while the annual salary with bonuses increased by 10.5 percent.
Latvia overtook us marginally - there was a little more annual salary rise here, but as in Estonia, for a smaller number of employees compared to our state," says Povilas Blusius, a spokesman for the company that organizes the salary surveys and adds that with such trends in wage growth, the general economic indicators of the country that dictate them should also be taken into account.
In Estonia, wages grew fastest
Although wages rose for a smaller proportion of workers in Latvia and Estonia than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, annual wages increased by 71% of employees of surveyed companies and amounted to slightly more than in our state - 11 percent.
In Estonia, the salary rose by 73% of employees this year and increased by an average of 13 percent.
Trends in wage growth are also strongly influenced by employee turnover, as those changing jobs can receive much higher pay than in the previous job.
For those who have not changed their jobs in Lithuania in recent years and did not rise in positions, the annual salary has increased by 8.8% - here more often than in other Baltic countries also the bonuses have been paid.
In neighbouring Latvia, the annual salary growth for such employees was only 3.6 percent, respectively.
Estonia remains a leader in the Baltic states not only as the average highest-wager for new but also long-term workers.
For those who did not change jobs or positions, the reward here rose the fastest: monthly - 6%, annual, including attachments - as much as 9%.
According to a reward research specialist, such trends often depend on, or go hand in hand with, the country's general economic indicators: inflation or GDP growth, their projections, the state's monetary policy, and prevailing market sentiment.
For example, forecasts of the impending economic downturn encourage businesses to behave more cautiously and invest less.
The country's most dominant and fastest-growing sectors, such as information technology, construction, and pharmaceuticals, may also uplift general statistics and overshadow smaller developments.
The biggest tax burden falls on Latvians
When comparing the growth of rewards, it is also important to consider the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, workers pay the highest proportion of taxes depending on salary - as much as 31 or 34%, which can increase to 42.4 percent for those earning more.
There is a constant rate of 24% in Lithuania, so with higher salary growth in Latvia, employees may receive the same or even less perceptible growth than in Lithuania.
Estonia has a similar tax rate to Lithuania - 23.6 percent, so in this state we find the most favorable taxation of labour in the Baltic states.
The most competitive salaries in IT
According to the research conducted, in all Baltic countries, almost regardless of the level of position, the positions of IT specialists remain among the highest paid.
The opposite situation in retail - the market indexes of positions in this area are among the lowest, so employees earn lower than the market average income.
Compared to the previous year, the fastest wage growth occurred for engineering professionals in senior positions, as well as risk management professionals.
This growth in remuneration has not overtaken some positions in the IT field this year as well - a significant proportion of organizations have increased monthly salaries for information security professionals to as much as 14 percent.
Meanwhile, wages remained virtually unchanged in the retail trade.
However, some companies have successfully completed redesigns of their reward systems, so their annual salary for bonuses has risen by about 2 percent.
According to reward specialists, there is a trend that wage growth dictates the demand for the most marketable specialists as well - the demand for systems analysts continues to grow in the Baltic states.
Ariana Grande suffers again: ex-fiancee keeps making fun of
After his divorce from Ariana Grande, distraught Pete Davidson spills his pain creating jokes about their relationship.
While participating in Saturday Night Live, he chose to joke about how fast he was attacking a serious relationship.
Fans say it's true, as just three weeks ago, Ariana and Pete cancelled their engagement, which occurred after just a few months of dating.
Pete tried to create scripts that mention his failed relationship, but this will end up on the screens a little later.
It is rumored that the humorist who makes fun of his former relationship annoys Ariana herself.
Such jokes hurt her and not at heart.
At least that's how secret sources told the foreign news portal TMZ.
White or brown: which sugars to choose is recommended by a dietitian
White or brown?
Which Sugar to Choose?
During the survey in supermarkets, it became clear that although Lithuanians still traditionally prefer white sugar most often, it is surprising that many compatriots refuse this ingredient, dubbed white death, at all.
That the sales of brown sugar are growing is also not hidden by the representatives of the supermarket chains.
According to Maxima's spokesman, brown sugar is becoming more and more popular and is being bought by compatriots more and more, although regular, white sugar is still a priority by choice.
Organic sugar sales are also growing in specialty organic stores.
One of the most popular products out there is coconut sugar.
According to dietitian Dalia Vaitkevičiūtė, the main difference is the cost, and harmful health effects can have both.
"Brown unrefined sugars are three times more expensive, but from a health standpoint, these sugars are harmful to the body by multiplying them, consuming their excess," Vaitkevičiūtė said.
For those who cannot live without sugar, a dietitian advises to reduce its amounts little by little in everyday life.
Doing so - the benefits are manifold - the unwanted kilograms will also fall, and health will improve.
For a month of consistent sugar using less, it will be easier to give it up and at all.
"We form every habit in about a month's time, so after doing such an experiment, let's say, a month's time drinking some product without sugar - coffee or tea, we will see how positively it will work and I think we can all give up with a little effort," the ideologist gave advice on how to give up sugar.
Doctors claim that sugar has been dubbed a "white death" for good - abuse of sweets can become the cause of obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases.
Therefore, it is worth trying to consume it as little as possible, especially since this product is additionally added to many foods, even bread.
Another step of "Lietkabelis": Lipkevičius lends to another LKL team
The Panevėžys "Lietkabelis" team said goodbye to Vytenis Lipkevičius - the striker is on loan to Prienai "Skycop" team.
In this "Betsafe-LKL" season, V.Lipkevičius would throw 6.4 points in 22 minutes, rebound 2.8 balls, make 2 effective passes and collect 8.5 utility points.
In the FIBA Champions League, the 29-year-old 198 cm tall athlete's statistics were 3.8 points, 2.5 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 4.8 utility scores in 21 minutes of play.
In the near future, Lietkabel will announce a new purchase that will strengthen the composition.
S.Buškevičas joined the coaching staff
Assistant head coach of Panevėžys "Lietkabelis" team Nenad Čanak became Sandis Buškevičas, who is well known to Lithuanians.
The 41-year-old Latvian played in Vilnius "Lietuvos rytas" during the 2005-2006 season, and in 2014-2017 worked in this club's system as an assistant head coach.
Last season, S. Buškevičas coached the Yekabpils team.
Sports director Jonas Vainauskas invited Steponas Babrauskas to the staff, but this one is still going to continue his basketball career.
Vytenis Jasikevičius had also received the invitation, but the two sides failed to reach an agreement.
S. Buškevičas will work with Robertas Kuncaitis and Algimantas Bružas in the "Lietkabel" coaching staff.
Latvis will join Lietkabel on Tuesday and will be at Cido Arena during the FIBA Champions League match with Dijon JDA, but we will not see him on the bench yet, as registration has ended 24 hours before the start of the match.
Biofuel price cuts won't please everyone
In order to reduce biofuel prices, more deciduous trees will be cut in 2019 in Lithuania, the Minister of Environment says.
According to Kęstutis Navickas, this is to "affect" the prices of biofuels.
"We have large accumulations of certain species.
It needs to be balanced (...).
There is a concentration on soft leaves, because in this way we can also slightly affect the prices of biofuels," K. Navickas said in the Seimas on Tuesday, presenting the situation regarding deforestation.
According to K. Navickas, this year the price of timber in Lithuania increased by about 20%.
According to the minister, next year pines will be cut as much as this year, and fir trees - about 80 hectares less.
According to him, more timber has been cut in Lithuania due to favorable natural conditions.
"This should not be the case next year," Navick said.
10.2 million hectares of forest are now state-owned and 800,000 hectares are privately owned.
For the fight against food prices - a dubious obligation: will encourage to buy only in your district
Among the measures presented by the Ministry of Economy to reduce prices, there is a proposed obligation for state institutions and organizations to purchase 50% of food products from local producers, according to the news portal 15min.lt.
"The law would apply not only to small traders operating in regions, but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or stationery could also be supplied to the buyer by local companies that won tenders," Minister of Economy Virginijus Sinkevičius told the portal.
The president of the Meat Processors Association, Egidijus Mockevičius, has no doubt that this provision would discriminate against some entrepreneurs, and it would be difficult to control whether the laws are being used by the pe-sellers.
Valdas Sutkus, the head of the Business Confederation, also criticizes the measure for inconsistency.
Macron urges Europe to defend itself against Russia and the United States
French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday called for the creation of a "real European army" with the ability to protect itself from Russia and even the United States.
Macron, who has been calling for a joint European Union force since his coming to power, says Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
He has recently gained a strong argument after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Washington would withdraw from the landmark Cold War treaty on nuclear forces.
"We have to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States," Macron told Europe 1 radio.
This is his first radio interview since taking office as president in May 2017.
"When I see President Trump announcing that he is withdrawing from an important disarmament treaty created after the 1980s rocket crisis in Europe, who will be the main victim? - Europe and its security," the French leader said.
The aforementioned missile crisis was caused by the race for the development of non-strategic nuclear weapons at the end of the Cold War, during which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was a major factor that prompted the United States and the Soviet Union to conclude the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 1987.
"We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a real European army," Macron said in an interview recorded Monday evening in Verden in northeastern France as the president visited the sites of World War I battles this week before the 100th anniversary of the end of this conflict.
According to Macron, in a situation where "Russia, which is on our borders, has demonstrated that it can be a threat...we need a Europe that defends itself better than simply being dependent on the United States."
The French leader became the main initiator of the project to establish a force of nine European countries capable of rapidly conducting a joint military operation, evacuation from a war zone, or providing assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
The defence ministers of these nine states will meet for the first time in Paris on Wednesday to discuss details of how these forces will operate.
The European Union is also set to dramatically increase its defence budget from 2021 and allocate around 13 billion euros over seven years to research and development of new techniques.
The EU's current defence budget is less than 600 million euros.
However, Bruno Alomar, a professor at the French military school training high-ranking officers, said Macron's vision of a closely united European defence was difficult to implement.
"The idea of creating a culture of common strategy is not bad," he told AFP news agency.
"There is, however, a huge gap between the European defences that Emmanuel Macron dreams of and reality - very big disagreements between European partners."
Lukashenko threatened NATO with missiles: we're not idiots
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said on Tuesday that his country would need new weaponry if NATO continued to build up forces on Belarus's western border.
"If NATO continues to intimidate, deploying bases or anything else in Poland, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, primarily missiles," Lukashenko, who met with a group of American analysts in Minsk, was quoted as saying by the state-run BelTA news agency.
The head of state also noted that Belarus already has its own missile manufacturing industry.
"Recently - you've noticed, and we're not hiding - we've built our own missile industry and made our own highly accurate (targeted) missile weaponry," the president said.
Last week, Lukashenko stated that Minsk and Moscow were looking for a suitable and inexpensive response to plans to build a base in Poland and to name it in honor of U.S. President Donald Trump "Fort Trump".
"Of course we are concerned about this.
If, let's say, in Poland they declare that they are willing to spend millions of dollars to station (...) some Fort Trump there, of course, we are not idiots and of course we are reacting to that," Lukashenko stated while attending discussions of the Munich Security Conference's main group in Minsk.
"Obviously, with our main ally (Russia), we are considering how to respond to all of this and how to find a corresponding response at minimal cost," he added.
Western relations with Moscow deteriorated sharply as a result of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Their ties are also marred by Moscow's role in the Syrian conflict and an attempt by Russian special services to poison former double agent Sergei Skripal with a nerve agent in Britain in March this year.
Tensions between Moscow and Washington worsened after Trump announced in October that he planned to withdraw from the Cold War-era nuclear arms treaty.
Russia warned that the move could disrupt the world's security system.
The man who carried out the brutal execution revealed how he killed the footballer who raped his wife
Brazil was rocked by a heinous crime in which this country's footballer Daniel Correa Freitas was executed violently.
The athlete was killed during an 18-year-old girl's birthday celebration.
A 24-year-old footballer was found dead in Parana, southeastern Brazil.
He is reported to have been executed, with genitals cut, and severe injuries in the neck area also reported.
Edison Brittes Junior, 38, who killed the footballer, pleaded guilty and claimed that he did so because of the rape of his wife Cristian Brittes by D.C. Freitas.
The Brazilian who committed the heinous murder later told in detail on television what happened on the fateful night.
"The party had already gained momentum when I realized that I hadn't seen my wife Cristiano for a long time anywhere.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
Unexpectedly, I broke the door open, and I saw Daniell lying naked in bed and my wife asking for help.
I was fatally furious.
Together with my friends at the party, we dragged him outside in a car.
Here I had a knife with which I also stabbed to death the man who had raped my wife.
I was very angry, I couldn't do anything for myself at that moment," the murderer said.
Along with his friends, he dumped the dead body of a football player near the river, where police officers are also searching for the main tool of a heinous crime.
Civil police in Brazil detained E.B.Junior, as well as his wife and daughter who celebrated her birthday.
Police officers investigating the incident are said to still lack evidence that a woman was raped during the party.
True, the recently circulated last messages and pictures of the footballer on the WahtsApp occasion may help the course of the investigation.
The footballer sent two photos of himself in bed to one of his friends via WhatsApp, next to a sleeping woman who turned out to be the killer's wife, Cristiana.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in the various rooms of the house.
I'll eat an anniversary mother, even though her father is somewhere nearby," the footballer wrote to his buddy.
Daniel Correa Freitas, who was a member of the Sao Paulo club, was loaned this season to Sao Bento, who competes in the second most capacity in the Brazilian league.

"Ostino Powers" fans lost their heads: another part of the film awaits
The cult comedy "Ostin Powers" has captivated millions of people around the world.
Futuristic, laughing shots and costumes are still and now becoming an inspiration for many fans.
Mike Myers, the filmmaker and lead star of the film, announced that a fourth "Ostin Powers" film was also waiting.
However, one of the main actors who embodied "Mini Me" in the film will no longer be seen.
Actor Verne Troyer, who played him, died early this year at the age of 49.
In October, it was confirmed that the actor had taken his own life.
Mike Myers assured that Verne's Austin Powers world would definitely be missing out - the film would not be the same without him.
Verne was a fantastic comedy actor.
When we wrote the script, his character was not laai special - all the popularity he created himself.
He was a great stuntman, a great dancer and a great man," Mike Myers spoke of him.
Juliette Lewis will join the series "Conners", created under the direction of "Rozan"
The star of the series "Millions of Particle" and "Standing" Juliette Lewis confirmed on Twitter that he had joined the series Konersai, under development by Roseanne.
"Yes, that's true.
The secret is revealed! #JulietteLewisisontheconners #TheConners," the actress wrote on Twitter this week and posted a photo of her holding a script with the title of a situation comedy.
In another photo, Lewis is photographed with Johnny Galecki and Sara Gilbert, who play a divorced couple of David and Darlene in the series.
"Guess who will join #TheConners ???!
I met my brother again from the Grizwald family!
That's great.
Script TOKS GOOD. #JulietteLewisisonTheConners," Lewis wrote.
Lewis and Galecki played brother and sister Audrey and Rusty Griswoldus in the 1989 film Christmas Vacation.
According to the Hollywood Reporter, Lewis will play Galecki's girlfriend Blue, but it is unclear how many series they will appear in.
The Conneries' debut is scheduled for October.
Ratings for the series that returned this spring were high and it resumed for another season, but its creator and star, Roseanne Barr, was also fired in May, as he shared a racist joke on Twitter about a former Obama administration official.
The Coners will feature most of the original Roseanne team, including Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman.
Showtime cancelled the series "I'm dying here" after two seasons
"The showtime drama-comedy I'm Dying Here, produced by Jim Carrey, is cancelled after two seasons.
Showtime refused to order the third season of Jim Carrey's produced drama-comedy I'm Dying Here.
Deadline.com says the cable network cancelled the series due to low viewership.
The series, featuring Melissa Leo, Aria Graynor, Michael Angarano, Clark Duke, R.J. Cyler, Jake Lacy and Andrew Santino, took place on the stage of the 1970s Los Angeles live comedy performances.
"I'm very grateful for the last three years. When I'm asked about the series, I say, 'It's a complicated series about complex people... But it was fun to create it.' Thank you for watching it," Angaran wrote on Twitter on Friday.

Eva Green and Marton Csokas will play in the BBC drama Lights
"Cheap Horror Stories" star Eva Green, "Destroyed" star Marton Csokas and "Robine Hood" star Eve Hewson will play in the BBC six-part drama Lights.
Eleanor Catton's Man Booker Prize-winning series begins filming in November.
The story takes place during the gold fever of the 1960s in New Zealand.
"Eleanora wrote some great scripts.
I really liked her novel, and the adaptation for television reveals even more exceptional things," Green said in a statement.
"It's been a lot of fun adapting the novel for television and I'm excited to be able to work with amazing artists from different fields," Catton added.
"The novel is written in solitude, and writing the script is definitely teamwork and it's great fun for me that the world of 'Lights' has expanded and become richer in a way I couldn't have imagined.
It's great to be led by the amazing Claire McCarthy, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this great team will play this story."
Alabama Hurts can no longer exercise suspension
Alabama backup player Jalen Hurts will no longer be able to be suspended for this season after this Saturday.
Hurts is included in the top-rated Crimson Tide Saturday game against the weaker Louisiana team and this is the fifth player game this season.
The NCAA applied a new rule this year to suspend a player who participated in four games.
This month, Athletic reported that Hurts planned to do so due to conflicting evaluations he had made and the team's coaching staff's response to them.
Tua Tagovailoa replaced Hurts at the start of the season, but Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said he still planned to use Hurts' skills.
Last season, Hurts helped Alabama qualify for the national champion title against the Georgia team, but the second half was replaced by Tagovailoa, who contributed to the Crimson Tide victory by a score of 26:23.
Former Southeast Conference quarterback Hurts started the last 28 Alabama games and entered the season with a record score of 26:2.
In Saturday's competition, Hurts completed 22 of 31 passes in the first four episodes of the Crimson Tide, ran for 276 yards, scored four times, and took over the ball once.
He also ran with the ball 15 times and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Dez must sign contract immediately
Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dez Bryant said he would return to the NFL soon.
A member of the Hall of Fame, Terrell Owens, said Bryant would rather not delay.
In response to a question asked on Twitter when he was going to sign a contract with the team, Bryant posted a one-word Twitter message on Friday: "Soon."
Three times selected for the Pro Bowl, Bryant has not been part of any team since the Dallas Cowboys abandoned him in mid-April amid a salary dispute.
Bryant, who may have given up his contract with the Baltimore Ravens and is regularly associated with the Cleveland Browns, said just before the season that he wanted to improve before signing a contract with the team.
After entering the Professional American Football Hall of Fame in August, Owens, who is still talking about returning to the NFL, told TMZ that Bryant should try to return to the sport as soon as possible.
"He has to join the team and prove to everyone he can," Owens told the site.
"All the reviewers think he's no longer looking and he's not as good as he thinks himself.
Now he has to get on the team for any salary, accept a one- or two-year contract - it doesn't matter at all - and show everyone what he's capable of."
Bryant caught the ball 69 times on the Dallas team in 2017, ran for 838 yards and scored six times.
The 29-year-old player did not run 100 yards for the longest time in his career, 23 matches.
After signing a five-year $70 million contract in 2015, Bryant did not run 1,000 yards for any season and did not catch more than eight points-winning balls.
"If the CEO or owner thinks your skills are deteriorating, you won't be able to secure or accumulate the amount you want," Owens advised.
He also warned that Bryant must get on the team as soon as possible, as this could later fail altogether and said that it would be possible to return to the hard times the Cowboys were going through.
"Of course. I don't know if their relationship is broken," said Owens, who scored 38 times while playing on the Dallas team for three seasons.
"I think in Dez's case, if the Cowboys take him back and he gets a chance, it's going to be good for Dez and the franchise."
CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania is alleged to have been established
Representatives of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN, European Organization for Nuclear Research) who visited Kaunas last week assess the possibilities of establishing a CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten such business incubators in Europe where companies receive assistance in commercializing CERN technologies, developing innovative products and adapting them to the needs of society.
Although Lithuania only became a member of CERN last year, the establishment of a business incubator for this organization in the country was already hanging out.
CERN representatives in Kaunas visited Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) Institutes of Materials Science and Biomedical Engineering "Santakos" in the valley.
At the meeting at the National Innovation and Business Center (NIVC), the guests together with KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuanian Energy Institute, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Economy and business representatives discussed about Kaunas innovation ecosystem and opportunities for young, innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important because if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a significant impact on the region's science and business innovators.
"Such an incubator would promote the application of CERN's accumulated knowledge and technology to the solution of important problems, such as new technologies and artificial intelligence would be used for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and the processing of big data," says Dr Leonas Balaševičius, Vice-Rector of Science and Innovation at KTU.
CERN incubators, like other young business development centers, provide assistance in business development - providing information and expert advice in the application of technology in product development and helping in the search for sources of funding.
The only difference is that the CERN incubator is more science-based.
Such a center in Lithuania would include experts in various fields: information technology, materials engineering, as well as medical specialists.
The organization CERN is best known for the Large Hadron Counterflow Collider (LHC, The Large Hadron Collider), the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator, located in Switzerland.
However, CERN conducts research in areas other than quantum mechanics, ranging from cryogenics (the effects of very cold temperatures on materials) to particle monitoring and radiation testing.
These technologies and the work done by scientists affect many areas of public interest: medicine, security and industrial development.
Vilnius Vodka has a new manager
The beverage manufacturer AB "Vilniaus vodka" appointed Rokas Mituzas as the new CEO, who will replace Raimondas Pilke in this position.
Mr. Pilke, who has been running the company since the summer of last year, will continue to serve as the financial director of Vilnius Vodka, according to a report circulated through the Nasdaq Vilnius Exchange.
Mr. Mituz is the co-founder of the sauce-producing company Buga LT, indicated on his LinkedIn account.
In 2012-2017, Mr. Mituz served as regional director at SPI Group, even before he worked in Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever groups.
Vilniaus Vodka finished the first quarter of this year with a loss of 315.500 Eur.
During the corresponding period last year, the company earned a profit of 392,300 euros.
The company's sales revenue without excise was EUR 4.956 million and decreased by 13.16% compared to the first quarter of the previous year.
More than 100 people work in the "Vilniaus deginė".
STT Detained R. Ača - Business News
Former parliamentarian and former Raseiniai District Municipal Administration Director Remigijus Ačas is suspected of bribery.
He is in custody.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) reports that Šiauliai Board officials are conducting a pre-trial investigation into possible corruption that took place in Raseiniai District Municipality.
"The former Raseiniai District Municipal Administration Director R. A. (Remigijus Ačas - Rev. Past.) is suspected of bribery.
Circumstances regarding non-transparent public procurement are being investigated, with R. A. acting as municipal director - a possible exceptional favour for a single private company to enter into a public procurement agreement with a company owned by the municipality of Raseiniai district.
It is suspected that R. A. accepted a bribe of high value (more than 250 MSL) for this," the STT said in a press release.
BNS adds that the company is a "Rasetic Bus Park".
On Monday, officials also detained Vladislovas Šimaitis, the head of Raseiniai bus park, a company owned by Raseiniai municipality, suspected of corruption.
This was confirmed by STT spokeswoman Renata Endružytė to BNS.
The STT report said the allegations were also made against two representatives of companies who bribed Mr. Ača directly or were involved in masking bribes in various financial operations.
All suspects are detained, and searches have been carried out at their workplaces and at home.
Suspended membership in LSDD
Remigijus Ačas was for a time the director of the Raseiniai District Municipal Administration, but after the council did not approve his report in April, he lost this position.
He was also mayor of this district in 2011-2012 Mr. Ačas - a long-time member of the Seimas, and he has been elected to parliament since 2004, as a candidate of the "Order and Justice" party.
However, in 2013 his and this party's ways diverged, and in the 2016 Seimas elections he failed to win his mandate independently.
Mr. Ačas now depends on the newly founded Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LSDD) led by Gediminas Kirkilas.
Shortly after the news aired, LSDD chairman Kirkil informed a press release that Mr. Ach had temporarily suspended his membership of the party while the investigation was ongoing.
"The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the allegations made against Remigijus Ačas are an unpleasant surprise for us, but in all cases it is necessary for law enforcement to do all the necessary actions in order to find out the truth.
R. Ačas has temporarily suspended his membership in the party while a pre-trial investigation takes place," says Kirkil, the leader of the LSDD.
In 2003, Mr. Ačas was the head of the advisory group of then-President Rolandas Paksas, who was later removed from office through impeachment.
Mayor A. Gricius: I did not directly control the works of R. Ačas
Neither the mayor of Raseiniai district Algirdas Gricius nor the current head of the municipal administration Liudas Kavaliauskas told BNS on Monday that they had any information as to what specific purchase could be related to the investigation by law enforcement.
Mayor Gricius claimed to have learned of Mr. Atch's detention from the media.
"I can't really say we were very distancing in terms of functions, I was doing my job as mayor, he (R. Ačas - BNS) - the work of the administration, and I couldn't say either for what reasons or for what procurement this case has been done," the mayor told BNS on Monday.
He also claimed for the same reasons that he was unwilling to appreciate Mr. Ačas' former leadership of the municipal administration.
I would be afraid to say something so that I could appreciate his activities, since I did not directly control the work of the administration he was doing, as far as I was presented for public procurement, for tenders, would say that such and such procurements occurred, such tenders, then what was visible in the public space, contracts were made, something I already saw as mayor.
So I can't describe how he ran the administration at the time as its director," Mr. Gricius said.
He said he did not intervene in or influence public procurement himself.
Minister of Culture team - new advisor
The advisory team of Liana Ruokytė-Jonsson, the Minister of Culture, was supplemented by associate professor Dr. Josephas Blažiūnas.
He will advise on the management of archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage.
The Ministry of Culture reports that Mr. Blažiūnas, who obtained his PhD in the field of art science at the Vilnius Academy of Arts, has been Director of the Lithuanian Archive of Literature and Art since 2016 and Associate Professor in the Department of Museology at the Faculty of Communication at Vilnius University.
By the way, in 2017 students of VU Faculty of Communication elected Mr. Blažiūnas as the best lecturer of the faculty.
The new adviser to the minister is the author of many scientific articles on cultural heritage and preservation of values.
Kaita does not stop
VŽ recalls that in May of this year, the team of Minister of Culture Ruokytė-Jonsson was left by advisor Dr. Viktor Bachmetyev, who advised the Minister on public information policy, and was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renaldas Augustinavičius announced his resignation from the post of Vice Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums and libraries.
Mr. Ruokytė-Jonsson then said that a new vice-minister of her choice would curate the same areas as Mr. Augustinavičius.
Currently, in addition to Mr. Augustinavičius's area of taking over Mr. Blažiūnas, the minister's advisory team consists of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidijus Gailiūnas, Rusne Rinkevičienė and chief advisor Egle Saudargaitė.
S. Gentvilas: GPAIS's inoperable business faces €90 million in fines
Simon Gentvilas, vice-chairman of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee, says that the poorly functioning Information System for Accounting for Products, Packaging and Waste (GAIS) may result in the payment of nearly 90 million euros in fines to Lithuanian producers and importers at the end of the year.
"As the end of the year approaches and the GPAIS system does not begin to function normally, the systemic crisis in the packaging handling sector is becoming an increasingly realistic scenario.
Unofficially, it is stated that certificates confirming the management of packaging waste were issued only 1% of the intended recycling tasks," Mr. Gentvilas states in a press release.
Seymūnas initiates an extraordinary meeting of the Environment Protection Committee on 7 November to discuss the situation, to find out why the functions of this program are not working, for what reasons the program module is not actually implemented and how the Ministry of Environment intends to address the problem.
"Without the necessary legislative or legislative changes initiatives, manufacturers and importers are at risk of reapplying with enormous environmental pollution taxes as early as the end of this year," Mr. Gentvilas says.
In his view, the deficiencies and omissions in the accounting system of the GPAIS signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the "Metrail" crisis.
Concerns about tasks
Some experts warn that some companies may not be able to meet state-imposed recycling targets for packaging waste in 2018.
After seeing the first half-year rates of packaging recycling published by organizations, specialists say they see reason to worry that some organizations may not be able to handle the required amount of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some companies might no longer be able to benefit from the pollution tax relief and would receive a pollution tax on a certain amount of their annual packaging placed on the market.
VŽ wrote that two of the three producer organisations currently operating reject such concerns, and one does not make any comment.
Kęstutis Pocius, CEO of Green Point, the largest organization in the public sector, said that, at least formally, whether or not to manage the tasks depends on solving the problems of the information accounting system for products, packaging and waste (GAIS).
The Green Point plans that this year it will be able to overcome all kinds of packaging handling tasks except for glass.
Although the glass task of "Green Point" will not succeed this year, the organization promises to compensate members for the resulting losses.
Experts question the benefits of food vouchers
As the government plans to distribute coupons to less well-off people for food products and thus promote family or farmers' trade business, experts question the benefits of such an innovation.
They agree that the new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Marius Dubnikov, head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Business Confederation, says that coupons are obsolete and will not solve the problem, and the Government should focus on increasing people's income.
"The system seems rather strange and sort of taken from older textbooks.
If it is to help the public acquire something or have greater purchasing power, we must direct all capacity to increase people's income, and people must decide for themselves whether to buy in one store or another," Mr. Dubnikov told BNS.
According to him, the Government would hit people with lower incomes by offering food vouchers.
"Obviously applied to lower-income people, as if a voucher is placed on a tray, on which it would be written, va, we, this Government, have given you a voucher, and be kind to us.
It sounds like certain pre-election promises, where one wants to write one's signature very clearly to them," the analyst said.
According to him, the food voucher system will require additional investment and will also increase the administrative burden as it will need to supervise who and how they are allowed, and what their protection against counterfeiting is.
The bank's chief economist, Nerijus Mačiulis, says that with one instrument to achieve both goals - supporting low-income residents and small businesses - would fail.
"If it is support for small entrepreneurs, vouchers help compensate for price differences and residents can buy more expensive goods in smaller shops, then the price difference is compensated by the state from budget funds.
Then it's business support, but not population support," Mr. Mačiulis told BNS.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macro-economic impact and would not fundamentally alter the competitive position of small shops, but on the contrary create an additional bureaucratic burden and may make the arrival of new entrants more difficult.
"It would seem to be a rather bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and residents would also find it rather inconvenient, they should shop not in some larger store with a larger range closer to home, but look for several specialized stores with a smaller range," the economist said.
In other countries, coupons are used when there is a limited volume of goods or services and need to be given to everyone in the same way, or to some social group.
The residents then receive coupons for free and can spend them on food.
According to Mr. Mačiulis, they are also used in the labor market, providing temporary tax breaks for businesses, employing long-term unemployed, or, for example, former prisoners.
This practice, in the words of Mr. Mačiulis, was successfully applied in Lithuania as well.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said on Monday that the government's consideration of a new system of food vouchers would help the poorest people, increase competition, and promote the business of small traders or farmers.
Prime Minister's advisor Skirmantas Malinauskas told BNS on Monday that the idea is most focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could get a 20-30 percent discount.
According to him, the amount of vouchers would be limited to prevent abuse by farmers.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to have a benefit of 10-15 euros per month.
According to him, although the state budget has not yet provided funds for the program, it could be financed from this source, possibly European Union funds.
"Not everything currently scheduled or unplanned in the budget will be in the final, yet it will change in the Sejm, it happens, there can be funds transferred from one line to another, and from ministries, things can change in funding.
There is always a matter of priority, what would be the decision - or abandoning something, finding another additional source of income and so on," Mr. Malinauskas told BNS on Tuesday.
So far, it is decided to what extent and from when the innovation will be available.
