MG Baltic case: Gustavi's new lawyer says he has not yet been able to access case material
All the defendants gathered for the 11th hearing of the MG Baltic case on Monday: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The hearing began with testimony from the defendants.
At the last hearing, Alexander Doroshev, the new lawyer appointed by the state for Gustaini, told a panel of judges that he had not yet been able to access the case material.
MG Baltic's lawyer, Linas Belevičius, then stated that in order to ensure a full defence of the person, a panel of judges must allow the new lawyer access to the case file and asked for the hearing to be postponed.
"In order to secure a person's defence, he or she must have access to the criminal file.
It's not just a formal sit-in," Belevičius said.
The new lawyer, A. Doroshev, noted that he had not been able to access either the indictment or the entire file of the case.
In a previous court hearing, suspect Gustaini announced that he had refused his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard at the meeting.
The defendants' lawyers were outraged that the audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions favourable to the concern in the Seimas and other state institutions, and also made an impact in determining the winners of public procurements, recalls ELTA.
More than 150 persons were interviewed during the pre-trial investigation, of which more than 50 were members of the previous and current term of the Seimas, several former ministers, and members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 searches were conducted.
Gustainis is suspected of having received a bribe of more than 8,000 euros, G. Steponavičius of 15,000 euros, V. Gapšys of more than 27 thousand euros, and E. Masiulis is suspected of having taken a bribe of more than 106,000 euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade in impact, the Liberal Movement of bribery, trade in impact and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade in impact of these parties.
It is suspected that politicians discussed bribes with R. Kurlianskis, the vice president of the MG Baltic concern, and later suggested or supported initiatives favourable to the concern in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethics Guards: Board of the Liberal Movement on the Right of the Vilnius Branch
"The decisions taken by the board are in line with the statutes," its head Vytautas Tamošiūnas told BNS after the commission's meeting.
"Our decision was not something new.
We had already made the clarification as a commission in July, when there was a question about Pagėgiai and Utena.
We then said that by statute it is a matter of the competence of the board.
And if the board decides that some department can do as it pleases - go to the committee and the board approves it, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, which the board has accepted, then there is a decision that all the sections form party lists.
And if you don't get along with the board, then there's a chance to suspend membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, the party board will now decide on further actions.
On October 17, the Liberal Movement Board of the party overturned the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections not with the list of the party, but the newly formed election committee.
In the opinion of the party's board, the decision of the capital's liberals to participate in elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes, and the decisions of the board.
By October 31, the Vilnius branch had to withdraw its aspirations to participate in municipal elections with a committee list.
But the department didn't.
The former head of the department, the parliamentarian Aušrinė Armonaitė, has already withdrawn from the Liberal Movement.
The Mayor of Vilnius, former Chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, promising to seek another term as the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, which we are proud of!".
He also left the party.
Municipal council and mayor elections will be held in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India have trotted a tiger that previously tore one man, officials said on Monday.
Forest care official Mahavir Kaujlagi said that when the tiger was torn up by a man who worked in the fields late on Sunday, the villagers surrounded the beast and, as the female tried to escape, drove her with a tractor.
Residents say that this tiger also attacked and insinuated one young man about 10 days ago.
The village in question is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in the district of Lakhympur Kheri, approximately 250 km southeast of the capital of Uttar Pradesh state, Laknau.
The destruction of tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
Ramesh Pandey, the director of the discipline, said the case would be reported to the police under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
In April, villagers beat another tiger in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh state; he suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is India's national animal; under the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Government figures from last year show that at least one person was killed every day during the previous three years in encounters with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with tigers have been gradually increasing since the 1970s, when India launched a tiger conservation program that established sanctuaries in national parks and saw the harbing of big cats as a crime.
Although methods of counting tigers have changed, censuses would indicate that the then population of about 1,800 tigers has increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs must be labeled with microchips.
Kęstutis Mažeika, the chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, along with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Law, which propose compulsory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs be mandatory to be labeled with subcutaneous microchips, and that their registration and labelling be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be labeled free of charge by the state, and cats will be labeled in 2020, so there will be no worries for residents and the costs will be covered by specially scheduled state funding," said Kęstutis Mažeika, chairman of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for pet labelling.
This is expected to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal propagators, or sellers.
It is tentatively estimated that, based on the expected average cost of providing the chip and service, which will be around €5, all animal hosts will be compensated during the transition period.
The total cost of labelling all pets can reach up to 6 million euros.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be spread over three years and will amount to 2 million euros annually.
It is anticipated that funds for labeling programs will be channelled through the Municipal Environmental Support Special Program, whose revenues will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for cat and dog marking, but also for castration and other programs.
According to K. Mažeika, the practice of mandatory labeling is common in almost all countries of the European Union, which allows to protect the animals themselves (because the lost can easily be returned to the owners), and saves the time of the animal growers themselves when they have to spend a lot of time and money on the search for a runaway and lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only possible with pets that have been labelled.
At the same time, labeling obligates responsible care for the animal throughout its life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labeling have faced opposition, as appropriate programs have been proposed to be funded by residents.
"The model now presented should avoid this criticism, as it is proposed to fund animal protection with increased income in the Environmental Support Program and the right to label not only veterinarians, but also publicists, i.e. persons from animal care institutions who have taken special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the project say.
The bill was registered by a group of MPs representing different groups of the Seimas - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 members of government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
Arif Noori, the provincial governor's spokesman, said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four more soldiers were wounded during an attack on a joint army and police checkpoint in Chogyani district.
According to Noori, six militants were killed and ten Taliban were wounded in a three-hour battle with Afghan forces.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid released a statement to the media in which the movement takes responsibility for Monday's attack in Ghazni province.
Noori said the post had been set up two days earlier in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban's supply route.
The post was completely destroyed in the attack.
"East" extended a helping hand to Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will be held at the Vilnius Ryto Arena, where Kosovo and Ukraine clubs will meet.
The duel will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius "Rytas", which maintains a warm relationship with Ukrainian basketball, will accept Cherkaski Mavpy and Pristina "KB Prishtina" teams under its roof at the Rytas Arena on November 7.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine we were unable to hold this match at home, so we are very pleased that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us," head coach Maxim Michelson of the Ukrainian team thanked "Tomorrow".
We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always get along well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best countries with basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope to get support from the villains.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine, as these countries have no diplomatic relations.
The Ukrainian team currently holds third place after the first round with one win in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has more wins.
This will be an extremely important encounter for Group E, as only two teams will enter the next stage.
In the past, Ukraine and Kosovo national team matches were also held in Vilnius in the selection for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
The Ukrainian team then celebrated the 100:61 victory.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the game for free on Wednesday, and the start of the duel is 7 p.m.
"Women Lie Better" star actress B. Arsobaite is pursued by liars
It is probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaitė has already been receiving roles related to liars for several times.
Initially, the series "Women Lie Better", then the play "The Lies" and finally the comedy "The Lies".
In this film, Brigita plays the outspoken wife of Dainius Kazlauskas' hero.
"I loved filming in 'The Lies' because I'm more of a theatre actress and I rarely appeared in the cinema.
The assembled wonderful team of colleagues promised a great result from the beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
However, the most interesting thing that happened on the court was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would really be big and serious.
I've never admired those little, decorative "fife" four-legged ones.
However, during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the hostess, but without success," the actress smiles.
A new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai" is starring in comic and intriguing peripetias of family members from the first minutes, which was produced by Paul Virbickas, producer of Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Among Us Boys..." and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov.
Your sweetheart just reported - she's pregnant.
That would be great news, just... your sweetheart is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Failing to publish "good news" to everyone, parents unexpectedly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this takes place just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - St. Christmas!
But the ending will surprise even more, as no one expected such a rout.
All heroes are not what they seemed at first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaite, the comedy "Melagiai" will present good mood to viewers by four generations of film stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedre Giedraitytė, Lubomir Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedy "Melags" - in cinemas since November 9.
Decides whether to write off €100 million in unpaid taxes from emigrants
The Seimas on Tuesday adopted an amendment to the Residential Declaration Law drafted by "Peasant" leader Ramūnas Karbauskis.
56 MPs voted in favor, 9 against, and 25 abstained.
Further consideration of the amendments will be undertaken by the Seimas on or after 6 December, having received the Government's conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared leaving Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, one person does not pay about 1,000 euros in three years, and now there are about 100,000 such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would "promote some people not to comply with their obligations" - declare their departure and then no taxes would be counted.
Conservative member of the Health Affairs Committee, Antanas Matulas, observed that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that they come to Lithuania for treatment by paying a small health insurance fee - they are provided with the same services as the residents who pay this fee.
The amendments provide that those persons who have left Lithuania would be considered to pay social security contributions in the European Union, European Economic Area states or Swiss Confederation, and "Sodra" would have exempted them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of "Sodra", has previously said that such a move will make life easier for people who have emigrated as well as for the activities of "Sodra".
Online video of a slippery teddy bear reveals a serious problem
Stripped as the mother loke climbs a steep snowy slope, and the toddler keeps climbing, slips down and climbs again persistently.
The video received numerous views and comments.
People admired the persistence of the little bear - repeatedly slipping down, he would climb to his mom again.
He succeeds not the first time, but the little one does not even try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video really belongs to the attention, but it also reveals the human threat to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to get to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
"It's obvious to me that the bear was very frightened by the drone.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If a drone did not fly around, they would likely have chosen a safer path or overcome it more slowly or cautiously.
It's a great example of how drones shouldn't be used," ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Ditmer and his colleagues were investigating how drones affect bears.
Animals were fitted with heart work gauges.
When the drone approached, some bears would let go to run, others would not run anywhere, but their hearts would all start beating more often with fright.
Scientists advise that drones are used responsibly to film animals, do not fly too close, do not make noise, and do not fly where it is prohibited.
A runaway president was approached through a newspaper
A Kiev court on Tuesday invited deposed President Viktor Yanukovych, who had left for Russia, to appear at a hearing of the case over his alleged state treason in an unusual way - the summons was published in the state's official gazette.
In a summons published in the government news newspaper "Uriadovoj kurjer", the former leader is invited to appear for a November 19 criminal procedure hearing during which his closing arguments could be heard.
The document states that V. Yanukovych has the right to attend the meeting by video link.
On October 30, a Kiev court announced that it had concluded the debate in Yanukovych's case.
Yanukovych's lawyer Alexander Goroshinsky, who works in Russia, was given the opportunity to register in the Register of Alien Advocates by November 19, so that he could attend a hearing where Yanukovych is expected to speak his last word by video link.
The Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the president's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Ukrainian-owned Crimean peninsula, and a little later, a war broke out in the east of the country between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
The fighting has since claimed the lives of about 10,000 people despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a long-term ceasefire.
The list of conservatives will be led to the Vilnius City Council by Valdas Benkunskas
The Conservative candidate for the year was already previously approved by the former Minister of Economy, Parliamentarian Dainius Kreivys.
Over the weekend, during the Conservative primary elections, party members ranked a list of candidates for the Vilnius City Municipal Council.
According to the party, V. Benkunskas, chairman of the Vilnius Chapters of the TS-LKD, became the leader of the Conservative list.
The top ten candidates included Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adam Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Baškienė, former Member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the Young Conservative League Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazikaitė.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will be held on March 3 next year.
Constraints of cogeneration plants appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) by the ruling parties to pass a law on the possibility of halting the construction of waste-incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the parliamentary opposition faction of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) reported that a group of members of the Seimas appealed to the KT to investigate the compliance of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the ruling parties with the Constitution.
"Parliamentarians stress that the provisions of the law aim to question the currently ongoing projects of waste incinerators, instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance from residential area) before the law comes into force for the construction of waste incinerators started in Vilnius and Kaunas," the report said.
"Parliamentarians note that in view of the way in which the law formulates a prohibition on the construction of objects of national importance for waste management (i.e., determining the distance and defining the concept of 'residential territory'), it must be concluded that this prohibition disproportionately limits or even negates the very essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the burning of waste for energy production, since the established criteria are formulated so that, after assessing the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, it is practically impossible to build such objects in the entire territory."
The appeal states that the law passed is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The CT has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and effects that have occurred prior to the entry into force of the newly enacted legislation.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law backwards based on an unspecified criterion.
Having established such legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law," the appeal states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made into Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power plant projects.
Stopping the currently ongoing projects would not only result in one hundred million financial losses for the state, huge losses would also be incurred by the Lithuanian population - heating prices would increase, and environmental pollution would increase due to the increasing amount of waste landfilled.
The appeal to the KT was signed by members from the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, the Social Democratic groups and the deputy head of the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group, Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas was able to collect 71 votes by the votes of the ruling parties to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Law passed by President Dalia Grybauskaite, which provided for the government's right to stop the construction of cogeneration power plants already started, and also established a "quarantine" zone of 20 km from residential areas to build such power plants.
The amendments to the law, which have been re-adopted by the Seimas, will come into force from 1 January 2019.
This proposal is scheduled to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, there are no plans to waive the government's right to suspend projects that have already begun.
The CT will hear the case in order - not earlier than a year later.
LeBron James's statistics at Lakers have been made public
The beginning of LeBron James' career at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he himself, the organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start helped to create rumors of possible dismissal by coach Luke Walton.
Still, such talks were calmed by the president of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, who stated that he would not forgive the coach, but that he needed to play better.
The team's biggest star, L. James, should look back on himself as well.
Although the quarterback's statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
However, she does not tell the whole truth.
Other figures emerged during the first ten games of the season, showing that the Lakers are playing better when L. James is not on the field.
The attacker is not favoured by +/- statistics showing how many points more are scored or missed by the team when certain players are on the field.
That's when L. James is on the field, the Lakers spent 30 points more this season than the rivals.
As he sat on the bench, the "lakers" scored 19 points more than the rivals.
The Lakers are currently in just 13th place in the Western Conference, but a few wins can turn things upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain would contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania greatly appreciates Spain's cooperation in NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and region," said Minister L.Linkevičius.
The Spanish Air Force has already conducted NATO Air Policing and Air Policing strengthening missions in the Baltic states five times, including three times in Lithuania.
The last time the Spanish Eurofighter fighters were deployed in Šiauliai was in May-August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations were held between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication issues in the fight against propaganda.
L.Linkevičius expressed hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to work closely together on the European, transatlantic agenda, and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004 when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On October 29, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented his credentials to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. Ačienė on the detention of R. Ačas: I believe in the innocence and law enforcement of the man
"For me, it was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, the services probably do the work they must do.
Everyone is doing their job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is fair and fair, that no unfair actions of his should be done," she told BNS.
R. Ača was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still being the director of Raseiniai municipal administration, took a large-value bribe, and in return could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed an agreement with the municipally owned Raseiniai bus park.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing Accha or having participated in masking bribes in various financial operations.
Raseiniai District Municipal Council dismissed R. Ača in April of this year on a third attempt after a expressed no confidence in him as the head of the administration.
A former "orderman" became a member of the newly founded Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas in March of this year, he suspended his membership in this party on Monday.
R. Ačas was unsuccessful in the election of the mayor a few years ago as a representative of the electoral committee "Your Raseiniai".
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to stand for mayor of Raseiniai next year, but has not yet decided whether or not he will participate in municipal council elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of the Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union, and she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she will wait for further law enforcement action - and that will depend on her distancing herself from working for the commission.
"I'm not making any sudden decisions today, I think I'm going to make a decision this week.
I will see, if there is a necessity, what kind of incriminations I will naturally make one decision or another.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - it's time to put things in their place," she said.
Opposition Conservatives representative in the Seimas Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė called on Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and "Farmer" leader Ramūnas Karbauskis to distance themselves from statements made by the group's colleague Vida Ačienė and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by transferring to work on another Seimas committee or commission.
She states that further work by V. Ačienė on the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would create a distrust in society and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission."
Sensual "Coldplay" music also interested famous Lithuanian couples
On the autumn night of Monday, numerous music and film lovers gathered for the pre-premier of the film Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
A whole group of well-known people came to the event: Jonas and Simona Nainius, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Silence and many others.
The film tells the story of Coldplay, one of Britain's most popular pop rock bands, which intertwines with moments from concerts.
Documentary director Matt Whitecross met the band's guys back when they were still playing in bars and gathering just a few dozen viewers.
One can see still nowhere in the film shots from behind the scenes of concerts, rehearsals or leisure time.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met at college in 1996 and founded the band Pectoralz.
They were soon joined by bassist Guy Berryman, and a little later by drummer Will Champion.
The band changed their name to Coldplay and exactly twenty years ago released their first record, Safety, which contained three tracks.
Of the 500 copies of the record, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of "Safety" went on sale.
Coldplay is a world-renowned, respected and beloved band that has released seven albums with over 100 million copies sold.
The band has won 107 different awards in two decades, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.

Palestinians shot by Israelis with knife in West Bank
The soldier "prevented this attack because he identified a terrorist who tried to strike civilians with a knife and an IDF (Israel Defense Forces) officer," according to a report issued by the Israeli army on the incident at the Kirjat Arba settlement near Hebron.
"The soldier opened fire on the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers were not harmed," the report added.
A military spokeswoman told AFP the attack was attempted by a Palestinian.
Video footage from the incident shows him being lightly injured.

Such attacks have declined in recent years, but there are fears that a new wave of them may arise.
On October 22, a Palestinian man was shot, attacking a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron with a knife.
Grybauskaite urges China to create more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaite invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investments of the European Union (EU) countries, and to facilitate foreign import conditions.
Opening a trade and investment forum at the China Import Exhibition in Shanghai, Grybauskaite stressed that seeing signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world", applying to the root causes of the tensions caused by trade wars, "production surpluses and unfair competition".
"For the European Union, China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment is very important - it is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to complete this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Grybauskaite said.
According to her, China's opening is important not only for Europe, but also for this state, as well as for global economic growth.
The President emphasized that transparency of investments must be "above the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, rule of law, strict adherence to international treaties - this must be essential for the environment of new investment relations," Grybauskaite emphasized.
"Corrupted capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China import exhibition tries to defuse criticism that it avoids opening up its market and only protects its companies.
More than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania, participate in the exhibition.
According to Statistics Lithuania, China is currently ranked 25th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50%, which amounted to 180 million euros.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded €820 million.
Some officials worry that China's investment in Lithuania may bring unwanted political influence, and Beijing's exclusive focus on Eastern Europe divides the unity of the EU.

The cause of the Lion Air plane crash has been revealed: relatives of the dead are angry
Data from the black box of the wrecked Indonesian airliner Lion Air indicates that a malfunction in the speed gauge has occurred in at least its last four flights, investigators reported Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSK), said a similar incident occurred during four of the plane's last flights, including the fatal one when the liner crashed in the Java Sea on October 29 shortly after takeoff from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed in this disaster.
Many media outlets reported problems during the previous flight of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," Tjahjono said at a press conference.
"Black box data showed that during the two flights before Denpasar-Jakarta was the same problem as well," he added.
"There are a lot of rumors on social networks.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (still data) there were about four flights that had problems with the airspeed meter," the NTSK head said.
During a meeting with members of the families of the dead, Tjahjono said the information from the device recording the flight data was consistent with reports that the aircraft had changed its speed and altitude erratically as the last flight took off.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air indicated that when a technical fault was detected during the flight from Bali to Jakarta, it was fixed according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
The company's co-founder, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to Transport Minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated the meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the plane and the remains of the victims and the investigation into the crash.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Kirana, who co-founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, introduce himself.
"Lion Air behaved inappropriately," said one man who presented himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island the plane was flown to.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air showed us no compassion."
After this meeting, Kirana hastily left, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of identifying the dead.
Nearly 140 corpse bags loaded with human remains were handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives questioned why the liner, which had been put into service two months earlier, was allowed to fly, although a breakdown occurred during an October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, among other things leading to a sudden drop in the plane that frightened passengers down shortly after takeoff.
Lion Air said the fault had been removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the technicians concerned must be brought to justice.
The law is very clear, not they said the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond in accordance with the law to prevent aircraft crashes in Indonesia from happening again.
Tjahjono said that the large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris spread over a relatively small area suggest that the liner likely crashed into the water while flying at a very high speed.
"The plane was solid when it fell into the sea.
It didn't explode in the air, and the aircraft's engines, when it touched the water, were operating at high revs - all of the broken turbine blades are showing it," the official explained.
The Lion Air liner crash is the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people were killed when a Garuda plane crashed near Medan.
After the accident, rescuers were waving from the wreckage: a minor was also hit
On Monday evening on the road, the Turtles - Plunge, cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz" collided at Tilvikai.
The cars collided with their foreheads, and three people were reported affected.
The BMW driver, who was born in 1999, was reportedly driven to the opposite side of the road and hit a Mercedes-Benz car in the forehead, which was hosted by her dad, who was born in 1967, and her daughter, who was born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters - rescuers.
The girl had her teeth knocked out of her Mercedes-Benz in an accident.
All of the victims were taken to the hospital.
President's office: No artificial relief needed on referendum
After the Seimas approved the ruling parties' proposal to reduce the referendum bar to the first section of the Constitution that currently has greater protection, the president will veto the amendments, according to its advisor Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and changing it, especially the articles in its first section, should certainly be at least a majority .
It's easy to predict that the president would really veto," Dalia Grybauskaite's domestic policy adviser told News Radio on Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first section of the Constitution defined the fundamental subjects of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, so reducing the number of votes necessary to change these articles would create a "negative precedent" and "turn out of control risk".
"In the president's view, no artificial relief is needed, more preparation for the referendum itself is needed, more dialogue with people is needed," he said.
The Seimas plans to vote on Tuesday on passing an amendment to the Referendum Bill.
It provides that a decision on amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution with higher protection shall be taken if at least two-fifths of the citizens with the right to vote approve it during the referendum.
Currently, the articles of the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution may be replaced by a referendum by more than half of all citizens with the right to vote.
Approximately 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths - one million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas approved a presidential veto in September on amendments previously passed in parliament that relaxed the requirements for the number of votes when changing citizenship defining Article 12 of Section One of the Constitution.
The cartel is proposed to be reduced in the run-up to the referendum on dual citizenship, and is scheduled to take place on May 12 and May 26, the first and second rounds of presidential elections are planned.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990 are currently not eligible for dual citizenship, with some exceptions.
Dual citizenship is sought by the world Lithuanian community, but fears that under the current conditions a referendum would not take place - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "brashka", so they need to be updated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is beginning to be tapped, so it must be upgraded, says Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is a minimal task that the state must perform.
"The air transport infrastructure is already porous because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - this is not even in distant planning, it is the minimum we must do," Masiulis said at a conference held by the Foundation for the Development of Democracy and the magazine "State" on Tuesday.
According to the minister, the next decade will be crucial as important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of Klaipėda's outer port, the refurbishment of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipėda, fix the airports, and maybe decide on the construction of the new airport.
We must not sleep, we must start projects now that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years," the Minister of Transport and Communications said.
Mr. Masiulis has reiterated that there has been too little funding for road maintenance in recent years.
"The condition of the roads is not improving yet, as there is insufficient funding available.
We are predicting the construction of new roads, but even basic maintenance, such as on expressways, lacks funds.
We must determine the amount that should be allocated for road maintenance if we want their condition to improve," said Mr. Masiulis.
He emphasized that exports of services in the Lithuanian transport sector grew by 18.6% this year, and Germany became the largest export market, ahead of Russia.
Mr. Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal, which would require EU carriers to periodically return tugs to the country of registration.
"We must make our exporters feel at home in Western Europe.
In my opinion, the proposal for trucks to return home permanently is absurd because empty trucks would run in Europe, would burn fuel, and would increase emissions.
Most of this will be won by the railways, as the cost will increase to such an extent that some of the transport will move to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," Mr. Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the transport sector generates 12.2%.
Lithuania's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It has more than 118,000 employees and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Dispute with Heritage Conservationists
Last week, Mr. Masiulis told the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building - this would allow the demolition of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, Algimantas Degutis, interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), called Masiulis' deliberations political pressure.
According to him, the building that was built in the 1950s is a value that was listed on the register in 1993, and not politicians, but specialists have to decide on its deletion.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of Lithuania's image.
"To pull that old terminal out of its heritage would be a politically important step to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal, so that when it comes to Vilnius it would feel in a modern country rather than in such an interesting one that does not truly represent our country as innovative," Mr. Masiulis said in the Seimas last week.
Mr. Masiulis also announced at the time that a completely new passenger terminal and an airport were planned to be built in Kaunas to connect to the Rail Baltica gauge, with the construction of an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to operate in 2026 after the completion of the Rail Baltica.
Last year, Vilnius Airport served approximately 3.7 million people, with 4.8 million passengers expected this year and 5 million expected next year.
Kaunas Airport handled a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.

Next year, he will start direct flights to Madagascar from Vilnius.
In the spring of next year, Boeing 767, the largest passenger aircraft flying on regular flights, will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly travellers from Lithuania directly to the island of Be, which belongs to Madagascar, according to the information of the tour operator "Itaka Lithuania" writes the portal "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that Blue Panorama airline passengers will be able to choose from 259 economy class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday destination will be reached directly from Lithuania as of April 2019.
Dominik Milowski, CEO of "Itaka Lithuania", says that he is trying to offer tourists from Lithuania new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, close to the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators have also prepared new holiday destinations for the 2019 summer season.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Finance minister on possible crisis: it's important not to talk about illness
"For more difficult times, we always have to prepare.
What I want to enjoy is that for the third year in a row we are accumulating reserves for the first time in the history of Lithuania.
But also a very important thing is not to talk about the disease," V. Šapoka said during a visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Minister of Finance and Vice-Minister Migle Tuskiene is attending meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The Ecofin meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce some tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that there should be an agreement on how the revenue generated should be taxed for the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States until there is a global consensus.
Draft budgets for the euro area countries presented to the European Commission (EC) will be reviewed in the Euro Group.
On 23 October, the EC rejected Italy's draft budget as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has taken advantage of this opportunity.
Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain have been asked for more information.
The Euro Group will also discuss the deepening of Economic and Monetary Union: options for implementing the European Deposit Insurance System and reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role for the ESM in financial assistance programmes, but it is believed that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.

Lithuanian working traditions and customs
Recently it was 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and ethnographer Balis Buračas (1897-1972) in Sidariai, Šiaulėnai County, then Šiauliai Governorate.
Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have a great opportunity to remember how a national revival filled with life has called many people of Lithuania, including brothers Buračus - Balis, Jonas, Bronius - from the very depths of the village to become involved in the fostering, meaning and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas, who travelled through his native land with a camera in his hands over more than 50 years, presented a wide and realistic view of our country's customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing strata of national culture and had a rare ability to realize the enduring value of his work.
In the photographs of Balys Buračas, the Lithuanian landscape, mounds, everyday life and festive environment commemorated our people in national costumes decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This publication contains a significant part of Bali Burač's legacy dedicated to the description of national labour customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the distinctiveness and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the last century, despite two world wars and a difficult occupation.
The manuscript of the book is particularly rich in the works of the inhabitants of the interwar Samogitia, especially the Kupiškės, Šiauliai, Telšiškės, as well as Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their holidays and other traditions and customs written by Balys Buračas.
More than 400 rare, mostly hitherto unpublished, photographs, which are grouped according to selected texts, have been selected from the remaining approximately 10,000 negatives stored in museums and archives for this publication.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture typical of Kupiškės, Dzūkiai, and other districts of Aukštaitija and Žemaitija.

Tragic fate of the couple: killed after only a few hours of marriage
In the southwest of the U.S. state of Texas, a newly married couple were killed in a helicopter crash just hours earlier.
The 24-year-old William Troy Byler and his peer wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler died Sunday shortly after midnight after a helicopter rammed into a hill 16 km northwest of Yuvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
Oddly enough, the disaster occurred when the flight was about 24 kilometres, exactly as the newlyweds were.
The helicopter pilot, 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University, located in Huntsville, Texas.
They married on Saturday evening at the Byler family's ranch near Yuvaldi and flew a family-owned helicopter after the wedding celebration.
The disaster occurred when the helicopter flew for approximately 24 kilometers.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antonio International Airport, where they intended to board a plane and fly on their honeymoon, said S. Kennedy, without giving the couple their final destination.
"It's a very rocky, uneven terrain, and that hill is about 120 to 150 meters high," Kennedy said.
G. D. Lawrence piloted the aircraft of that family for many years.
According to S. Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should become clear what the pilot's physical condition was and whether she could not have been the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after takeoff.
His wreckage had gone up a wide radius on the rocky slope of the hill, and the hull remained "dangerously suspended", Flight Safety Investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said at a press conference on Monday.
Investigators intend to remove the wreckage and then inspect it thoroughly, but it will not be easy for a tow truck and truck to reach the site, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been determined, and a preliminary NTSB report is expected in two weeks.
Israeli PM calls Iran's entry into force of new sanctions 'historic day'
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told MPs of his Likud party, his office reported.
"Today is the day when under President (Donald) Trump, the U.S. imposes particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran in the entire time that efforts to curb its aggression have begun," he said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would deal a "decisive" blow to Israeli actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the toughest sanctions ever", came after Trump's May decision and controversial decision to withdraw from a global powers agreement with Tehran over its nuclear program.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already plummeted by about one million barrels a day since May, and cut Tehran off from international funding.
Israel has long opposed the deal with Iran and says its scope and timelines are too limited.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has enabled Iran to fund militant groups as well as its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has promised to prevent it from establishing itself there militarily.
Other signatories to the treaty with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - oppose the US decision and say that the agreement has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court again dives into the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
In the case of the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, North Town, the court will hear testimony from a witness after the accident.
The Vilnius Regional Court ruled on Tuesday that in order to find out all the significant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses of the case will be questioned at the next hearing on 26 November.
An acquittal has already been issued in this case, but the prosecution does not agree with it.
On 22 August, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car due to the fatal motorcycle accident, after 79-year-old Eduard Osipov announced that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed in the city and committed a serious violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office is asking the district court to overturn the district court's verdict and claims that the accident is the biggest fault for E. Osipov, and the district court's conclusions are unfounded.
The acquittal is also sought by the family attorney of the motorcyclist who died.
The accident occurred around 3 p.m. on August 11, 2015, when a Škoda Fabia car driven by Osipov entered Žirmūnai Street from Lakūnai Street and collided with a motorcycle that was on the main road.
The prosecutor's office blamed the man for the car driver's violation of the Road Traffic Rules, intended to give way, and caused a traffic accident - the man driving the main road motorcycle "Piaggo" was killed.
Initial police reports indicated that the scooter driver was killed, but later after investigations, the vehicle was found to be likened to a motorcycle in terms of power.
Vilnius City District Court judge Rolandas Bužinskas has told BNS that experts have determined that the motorcycle driver was driving at 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the allowed speed in that place is 50 kilometres per hour.
"The driver of the car could not have predicted that the motorcycle would run at such a high speed," the judge said.
At the time, the driver of a respectable age car claimed to have driven at a speed of just five to six kilometers per hour.
After seeing the obstacle, the motorcycle driver tried to brake and fell off the vehicle before colliding with "Škoda Fabia".
The prosecutor's office believes that after going from side to main road, Osipov had to give way to a motorcyclist.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Wagner mercenaries killed in Syria
Among the dead were five Syrian military soldiers and six individuals belonging to the military company Wagner.
This is reported by the source of Novaya Gazeta in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Military Corps is stationed in the said area, with a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries" also joining.
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request to provide information about the fate of the Russians.
Former Belgian king to undergo paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as a child of a former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and Albert II had a long-running love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies paternity.
According to station RTBF, he can appeal to the Supreme Court in opposition to DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeals, Jacques Boel - Delphine's mother's ex-husband - is neither biologically nor legally the artist's father.
Delphine applied for an appropriate investigation so that she could be recognized as the daughter of a "real" father, Albert.
The CEC will distribute the money to the parties, but give nothing to the social workers
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) intends to distribute a budget grant of almost €3 million to the largest political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), headed by the parliamentary vice-president Gediminas Kirkilas, which was established this spring, is not yet scheduled to allocate funds from the budget.
But they can be allocated already in the near future by a separate decision of the CEC, if the legal environment governing the distribution of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjošaityte, the chairwoman of the CEC, informed the VŽ that "this Thursday, a commission meeting is scheduled to decide on the allocation of the budget semi-annual grant to the parties."
According to her, the CEC must make a decision on the matter by 15 November.
It is estimated that seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, will be allocated €2,751 million.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million euros, the ruling Peasant and Greens Union - about 0.55 million euros, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about 0.5 million euros, the opposition Liberal Movement - almost 0.4 million euros, the Sejm has no group of its own - about 0.23 million euros, the recently joined party of the ruling parties of the Republic and Justice - almost 0.22 million euros.
Under the current law, which will guide the CEC in allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP, established only this spring, to expect to receive money from the budget.
This party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least about a couple hundred thousand euros in the run-up to three elections next year - municipal, presidential and European Parliament.
The corresponding amendments to the Law on Political Parties and this year's Budget were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaite, which was passed by the Seimas.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but representatives of the ruling party Mr. Kirkilas and the Peasant-Green leader Ramūnas Karbauskis assure that the parliamentarians will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, this will not be possible until this Thursday's meeting of the CEC, so according to Mr. Matjošaityte, "the grants will be allocated according to the legal order that has existed so far".
It is true that the head of the CEC did not rule out that if the Seimas rejects the president's veto this week or next week and the new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to parties takes effect, the commission may consider a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"We will take into account the entire existing legal environment when making the decision, as we are an executive body with the implementation of the laws that are being passed," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and new laws came into force, they would allocate additional money to the parties by the Government, having borrowed the corresponding amounts for this purpose.
Grants already distributed to seven parties would not suffer as a result of such a decision.
The results of Šiaulių bankas have been exploited for the sale of shares

Poroshenko: Activist Handziuk's killers must be punished
"I want to state that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be checked very carefully, following investigative procedures.
As president, I have no opportunity and I do not have to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and law enforcement must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to know the truth and punish evil," Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in making Mr Handziuk's murder clear, and that the murderers, the organizers of the crime, and the principals would "take the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been retrained into a murder (case), they are quite rightly and reasonably threatened with a life sentence," the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly called the public's demand for an open and impartial investigation into the case.
Poroshenko stressed that the statements of law enforcement representatives in parliament should show that "the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whoever they may be."
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not help clarify the situation, but would confuse things even more.
"I call on all forces, both those supporting the government and the opposition, not to waste with unreasonable arguments and, God forbid, not to use this assassination for public relations," the president said.
- On the contrary, we must now unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - such as to raise public confidence.
There's just no other way for us."
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the situation in the country," he assured.
Mr Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked and tainted with acid in the city of Kherson in July.
She was an advisor to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but died in hospital on Sunday.
After police and prosecutors failed to clear the perpetrators of the attack, Ukraine's Attorney General Yuriy Lutsenko delivered a resignation statement on Tuesday.
After her death, government officials received accusations from public activists that they were unable to properly conduct an investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Interior Minister.
"Today I am submitting my resignation," Mr Lutsenko told MPs, reading his report of the inquiry.
Parliament has yet to approve the resignation of the prosecutor.
Mr Lutsenko blamed the activists for putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of Mr Handziuk's murder.
Bill Gates delivered a toilet without water
Introducing the futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such facilities to a waterless one to the computer revolution of the 1970s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates presented a high-tech toilet at an exhibition in Beijing that does not require water in plumbing pipes, Reuters reported.
A water-free toilet works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of wastewater are processed into chemical fertilizers.
"The technologies you see here are the biggest advances in sanitation in the last 200 years," Bill Gates was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
The technological toilet was created with the funds of a charitable foundation set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over the course of seven years, work was being done on a facility that could convert human waste into fertilizer or water, for which the fund spent $200 million.
In all, in the words of Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models were created.
The device is now complete and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500 thousand children under the age of five die each year worldwide due to poor sanitation conditions.
Tackling problems caused by poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases health spending, which is already 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates to a toilet presentation jar with fecal matter.
According to him, this is a good reminder of the fact that in a small example "there could be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100,000 worm parasite eggs".

Anxiety in France: People's deaths cause concern
French health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on the widely used pesticide, amid concerns about several dozen people recently poisoned in the west of the country.
The ANSES health agency announced that the decision to ban all products containing the pesticide meth had been made after a new safety inspection launched earlier this year, even before at least three poisoning waves began in September at the Department of Art and Loire.
As a result of these cases, the government had already suspended the use of the pesticide.
This soil disinfection chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it was used for approximately 700 tons each year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Ange region, where many salad broths are grown, have complained of eye and throat soreness, and breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the veracity of our decision but did not hasten it," Francoise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told the Ouest France newspaper on Monday.
Metam - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the U.S. and Europe - is considered a "probable human carcinogen" by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).
This pesticide, marketed under names such as "Vapam" and "Sectagon", is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is due.
"There was no choice but to remove him from the market, regardless of whether there were alternatives for him," Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties that will arise for lettuce growers, for farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed discontent with the government's decision last month to halt the use of meth in a region that relies heavily on intensive agriculture for its economy.
More than half of the 35,000 tonnes of lettuce consumed annually in Europe is grown in this region near Nantes.
There will be "much fewer salad sultans, radishes and pairs" next season, Philippe Retiere, head of the Federation of Nant Growers, told AFP last month after the government halted the use of the throw, the AFP news agency.
70 million euros invested in shopping centre with observation wheel in Tallinn
A new T1 shopping centre is opened in the Estonian capital next weekend, in which Pro Kapital Grupp, a local capital real estate development company, invested €70 million.
The 130,000 sq. m. general, or 55,000 sq. m leased, shopping centre will host 150 store services or entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer's report.
By comparison, the total area of Vilnius "Akropolis" (counting together with the area for offices) amounts to about 110,000 sq. m. And the rented - 91,000 sq. m.
"T1" - the first shopping mall with a rooftop viewing wheel, claims the developer.
It will be operational early next year.
In addition to it, international transport gates will also be integrated into the area: trams join alongside, and intercity buses will soon run.
The main "Rail Baltica" terminal also lies nearby, and is projected to serve 1 million passengers per year around 2026.
Paolo Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that there are major changes in the global supermarket business, and the development of T1 has managed to put them at the forefront.
"We have created a next-generation shopping center that provides emotions and experiences not accessible via the Internet.
It is a place of attraction for people in the very center of the city, a traveller's gate, an impressive and noteworthy attraction and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family," Mr. Michelozzi is quoted in the press release.
A strong focus on entertainment
According to the mall manager, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery center in the Baltic States.
A total of 12,000 sq. m, or one-fifth of the total area rented, is devoted to entertainment at the facility.
An exclusive highlight is the observation wheel on the roof.
It will raise guests to a height of 120 m above sea level - in Tallinn the taller only TV tower.
There will be a trampoline park "Super Skypark" under the wheel of a review, on the fourth floor, which will open the largest trampoline centre in Europe and the first basketball and volleyball ground on trampolines in Estonia, the company says.
The interactive SkyLAB Research and Discovery Center promises to take children at least 5-6 hours to complete.
The entertainment complex will also house 360 degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to empathize with virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to the visual effects and moving chairs according to the rhythm of the film, a sense of realism here will be enhanced by the tangible effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as the selected smells, smoke or fog in the cinema hall.
According to the developer, the opening of "T1" is expected to increase Estonia's revenue from tourism by €13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Exchange as well as the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
The group received €1.8 million in sales revenue in Lithuania last year and suffered €350,000 in losses, according to Pro Kapital Grupp's financial report.
In 2016, the Lithuanian market generated almost €9 million in sales revenue and earned a net profit of €2.4 million.
The T1 shopping centre was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
President Paul Biya sworn in for seventh term in Cameroon after controversial election
During a ceremony overseen by MP Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, the 85-year-old Biya promised to protect the "integrity and unity" of the West African state.
Africa's oldest president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner in the October 7 election with 71% of the vote.
Still, the election was marred by low voter turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biya's inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the principal, were kidnapped at a presbyterian school in the Northwest region, where English-speaking separatists are conducting an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million inhabitants are French-speaking and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, autonomy began to be demanded in the Northwest and neighbouring Southwest Province amid discontent over alleged discrimination in education, judiciary and economics.
Following Biya's refusal in 2017, the lenient radicals declared an independent state, the "Republic of Ambasonia", and raised their weapons.
According to non-governmental organizations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces officers were killed in separatist attacks and government counter-operations this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence, some across the border into Nigeria, but many are forced to live half-families in the forests.
In the October election, just 5% of voters voted in the Northwest region, while 15% voted in the Southwest Province.
In both parts of the country, Biya received two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative Primary Elections: Mistakes Caused by Inexperience
"Some things were missing in places - realize that the party organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities allowed their own premises to be used, but there were not voting booths everywhere because we cannot purchase them ourselves.
Thank you to those who loaned," the politician said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not change substantially, and the violations themselves are not malignant in nature.
"There were complaints.
Not all the people who participated in the election had experienced it - it was news for them as well.
So from that inexperience, not all actions were in line with our order.
Therefore, it was necessary to warn the CEC that the principles described by us would be followed.
Those complaints do not, however, give rise to doubts about the results," said A. Anušauskas.
According to the chairman of the CEC, there have been cases where ballot papers have been unsealed - the ballot papers found in the ballot boxes without a stamp have been annulled upon becoming aware of this.
Some towns lacked space, but according to A. Anušauskas, complaints and irregularities related to several dozen ballot papers.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it really doesn't make a fundamental difference to the election results," Anušauskas explained.
The turnout of party members in the election is said to have been 55%, while the turnout of non-partisan voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked for the commissions.
The results announced on Sunday do not change either - 79% of voters (16,418 votes) voted for Ingrid Šimonytė, while 21% voted for Vygaudas Ušackas (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support I. Šimonytė's candidacy in the country's presidential election to be held in May next year.
Trump says he probably won't meet Putin in Paris
White House National Security Advisor John Bolton said earlier that Trump would meet with Putin in Paris, where events to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I will take place this week.
But as he left for the final rallies ahead of the U.S. Congressional midterm elections, Trump told reporters he was not sure if this would be the right opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," the U.S. president noted.
Still, the White House chief added, the two will see each other at the G-20 summit and "probably meet many times" afterwards.
Trump is still trying to "reset" relations with Moscow despite allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Kęstutis Strupas asks to overturn VTEK's decision
Kęstutis Strupas, former CEO of Santara Clinics at Vilnius University, asks for the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEK) to be overturned - it acknowledged that transactions were not declared in time and thus violated the law.
The complaint was examined by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on November 26.
The applicant is asking for the decision of the VTEK to be overturned on May 23, Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduone, a spokeswoman for the court, told BNS.
K. Strupas believes that gifts given to loved ones must not be declared, he claims to have understood the exception to the law in this way.
VTEK announced in May that the then deposed CEO of Santara Clinics K. Strupas and head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Division of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital Silvija Strupiene violated the provisions of the law regulating the declaration of private interests.
The investigation found that four transactions were declared not complying with the deadlines: a loan taken with the spouse from the bank in 2010, a purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift given to the daughter in 2017 - an apartment and a loan granted and not repaid to the natural person together with the spouse in 1996.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by missing deadlines.
Persons who have violated the law on the coordination of public and private interests in the civil service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges to declare not only one's own data, but also that of the spouse.
The investigation was conducted by VTEK on the basis of Info TV television information.
It is clarified whether K. Strupas and his spouse, head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Division of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, S. Strupienė duly and timely declared their transactions.
As Info TV reported, last year K. Strup donated real estate worth 125,000 euros to his daughter.
However, the former head of the Santara Clinics and his wife had not stated their interests in the declarations.
Law enforcement has, along with at least ten other individuals, made allegations in the corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, for winning public purchases of computers, software in clinics, companies demanded illegal financial rewards, and it is disguised as support.
In this way, K. Strup is suspected of having consulted at least five times, with public procurement in the field of information technology taking place in Santara clinics.
K. Strup himself denies his guilt.
The corruption suspect, Professor K. Strup, was sacked in September as head of the Santara Clinics.
By the decision of the Ministry of Health of Santara Clinics and Vilnius University, the employment relationship with K. Strupai was terminated at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10, 2013.
Santara Clinics continue to be temporarily headed by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until a competition is held to elect a new CEO, and it is promised to be announced as early as this year.

According to the President, L. Gutauskas combines religious, historical and philosophical metaphors, eternal values into the whole of the arts, and opens a thousand-year-old wisdom and memory of the nation.
The author's favorite and appreciated work - poetry, prose, children's literature, painting, and book illustrations - testifies to L. Gutauskas being an artist endowed with diverse talent.
On the occasion of her honourable anniversary, the President thanked the artist for the significant works that enriched Lithuania and wished her inspiration, happiness and success.
Schools already want to teach differently: promise fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in educational content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, who presented them on Monday at the forum "Change in educational content: foreign experiences for decisions in Lithuania".
Jurgita Petrauskienė, the Minister of Education and Science who spoke at the discussion, said that over 30 million euros had been invested in updating the curriculum over the last ten years, but no results were seen.
"According to the results of the international student achievement survey PISA, student achievement is below the OECD countries average," said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
In a report cited by the Ministry of Education and Science, OECD expert Phil Lambert said that Lithuania was too focused on providing knowledge rather than practical application of knowledge.
According to him, Lithuania's general education programs focus on developing students' literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but also need it to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and empathy.
Gražvydas Kazakevičius, the Vice-Minister of Education and Science, while presenting changes in the content of general education, said that the scope of the programs that begin to be updated this school year will decrease, they will be more specific, and the disciplines are more tightly linked to each other.
According to the Vice Minister, pupils' education will be more individualized, schools will become more self-sufficient - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30% of their unique educational content, the current system of assessment of pupils will change to a cumulative score, and the student's competences will gain more weight and acquire more informally.
There will be fewer standardized tests.
It is promised that the general education programs will be a digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, task bank.
Updating the curriculum aims to improve student achievement in the international PISA study by at least 10%, reduce the gap between student achievement by a third, students acquire modern competencies at school, and be literate in various fields.
Lithuania plans to allocate a sum of 7.8 million euros from the European Union and the state budget to update the curriculum from May 2018.
In the 2019-2020 school year, the draft updated general education programs are expected to be tested in a number of schools, and from September 2021 they will be implemented in all schools.
The ministry received criticism in early October for a project worth nearly €8 million by the Center for Development of Education to upgrade the general programs of primary, basic and secondary education.
A total of 7.8 million euros were earmarked for this purpose for four years, with the first purchase of 1.3 million euros announced in early October to search for developers of educational programs.
After experts criticized this purchase, it was suspended, and Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė dismissed Giedrius Vaidelis, the director of the Center for Development of Education.
In Lithuania - exercises on how to respond to extreme flooding
A ten-day exercise to improve institutions' response to extreme flooding begins in Lithuania on Monday.
As informed by the Fire and Rescue Department (PAGD), the exercise will examine how state institutions are prepared to work in the country after declaring a state-level emergency, such as flooding: to liquidate its effects, coordinate people's search, rescue and emergency eviction from flooded areas, organize their provision of drinking water, food, ensure the necessary energy supply and take other measures to protect the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries of the country, other institutions, as well as members of 12 municipal emergency operations centers will participate in the exercise.
A preparatory phase of the exercise will be held on 5-13 November, during which municipalities will make decisions on emergency management after receiving information from the Hydrometeorological Service about non-stop precipitation and starting flooding from the PRTD.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for November 14-15.
During it, the State Emergency Operations Center will operate in the department and the Emergency Operations Centers of institutions will operate in state and municipal institutions.
After the government declares a state-level emergency due to the effects of the flood, the head of operations appointed by the prime minister will lead the emergency response, its removal, and actions to protect and rescue residents and property.
Deputy Director of the PAD Mindaugas Kanapickas says that the most important thing in the exercise is to check the readiness of the institutions to perform the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibilities to exchange information, to check how the residents, state and municipal institutions, institutions and enterprises have been prepared to warn and inform about the impending disaster and to "improve the emergency management skills of state institutions".
The exercise will also showcase the combined fire-rescue capabilities of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to pump huge amounts of water from flooded areas.
The BaltFloodCombat module was established in 2009 for this purpose.
Ukraine's Attorney General Yuriy Lutsenko resigns
Ukraine's Attorney General Yuriy Lutsenko announced his resignation in the country's parliament on Tuesday due to the resonance caused by the death of the acid-filled anti-corruption fighter Katherine Gandziuk, the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net reported.
According to Ukrainian law, the resignation request must be submitted by the Attorney General to the President of the country, who must submit it to the Verkhovna Rada for approval by a majority vote.
On Tuesday, Attorney General Lucenko presented the progress and results of a law enforcement investigation into Gandziuk's murder order in the Verkhovna Rada.
In a speech to MPs, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that Gandziuk's death was being exploited by politicians for public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her hometown of southern Ukraine, Kherson.
On July 31, an unknown assailant K. Gandziuk splashed acid in her face near her house.
She died in hospital on November 4 due to her injuries.
Protesters outside the Ukrainian Interior Ministry demand an answer as to who killed Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix photo.
According to Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation figures 12 individuals possibly involved in Gandziuk's murder order.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study has been leaked to the media, threatening the study's success.
According to the Attorney General, due to the leak of information, the suspects received essential knowledge for them.
Lucenko added that he knew Gandziuk personally and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"So that no one has reason to say that someone clings to power, I want to state that I am making a statement to resign.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today and you will have to consider this matter in parliament," Lucenko's speech in Rada is quoted by the Obozrevatel publication.
It is written that Lucenko added that "you can't allow dual rule in a country where the law enforcement system is broken without any evidence, even for crimes revealed."
Lutsenko is considered a close associate of the country's President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Attorney General on 12 May 2016 after prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, suspected of covering up corruption by top officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of "Orlen Lietuva"
As Elta was informed by Aurelija Vernickaitė, adviser to the Minister of Energy, the meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and after 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that currently does not reach the aggregate trajectories set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plans at EU level, with a share of renewable energy of 6% in 2015.
The EC estimates that progress towards a binding 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to a variety of challenges, including relatively high costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector comes mainly from biofuels (88%), and electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas took up the proposed corruption investigation issues to supplement the Conservatives' appeal to the KT
The Seimas on Tuesday after submission approved such a proposal, which was registered by the "Farmer" Agnė Širinskienė, who leads the investigation into the illegal influence on political processes.
There were 58 MPs in favour, against - 27, with nine abstaining.
Next, the draft will be considered by the Seimas committees, and the Law and Order Committee headed by A. Širinskienė has been appointed as the main one.
Once its conclusion has been received, a vote will be taken on passing an amendment to the resolution.
The Sejm's temporary investigation commission, which is currently conducting a new investigation into political corruption, has been instructed to investigate possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed extending this term by stating that "significant information about possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions has appeared in the public domain".
A. Širinskienė identifies in the project "a possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or when applying to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Chief Official Ethics Commission".
The appeal to the Constitutional Court for pensions was initiated by opposition conservatives.
The ruling "Farmers" found that the Conservatives relied to a large extent on the arguments of private pension fund advocates in their appeal.
Impacting the Chief Commission on Official Ethics (VTEK), the leaders of the "Farmers" accuse former comrade Povilas Urbšis.
According to them, former chairman of the Seimas Committee on State Governance and Municipalities could instruct VTEK members to dismiss former head of the Commission's Prevention Division Mindaugas Narrow.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to investigate the possibly illegal influence of interested persons or their groups, the impact on the course of elections, formation of coalitions, work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, activities and funding of parties and public movements, legislative processes, and the election and appointment of members of state-owned enterprises, heads of public institutions, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to look into what information law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to competent authorities, and how they have responded to it.
Investigators are expected to submit their findings by May 1 of the following year.
At that time, the presidential, European Parliament election campaign will take place.
Of the 12 members of the commission, seven are representatives of the "Farmers".
Its members were also appointed two social workers, one "regular", a liberal and a representative of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania-Christian Families Union.
The Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the commission's work.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union.
According to him, an investigation by the Committee on National Security and Defense (NSGK) last session on essentially the same subjects showed that the investigation needed to be continued.
German domestic intelligence chief loses post
The 55-year-old Maassen further fueled the controversy by stating that "radical leftist forces" in Merkel's coalition were to blame for his troubles.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but forced to leave the reserve.
Among other things, it emerged last weekend that at a meeting of representatives of European domestic intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Maassen had criticized Merkel's "naive" immigration policy.
Germany's Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has long defended the head of intelligence, said at a press conference on Monday that Mr Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and "disappointed personally".
Seehofer, himself under pressure from both this dispute and his party's poor performance in Bavarian local government elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release H.G. Maassen to the reserve.
A series of shark attacks have intimidated the entire island - a third man has been bitten
A Queensland Ambulance Service report said the victim suffered "serious leg and wrist wounds" in an attack near Pentecost Island in Sid Harbor off the coast of Queensland State.
The man was taken by helicopter to the hospital.
Pentecost Island is the largest of the archipelago's objects of the same name, attracting many diving and sailing amateurs from all over the world.
Shark attacks in this region have been relatively rare to date.
On September 19, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbor, and a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay the next day.
The last time prior to the latest series of attacks, an attack on sharks occurred in this archipelago in 2010.
The CEC has two new members - Wisconsin and Puksa
A. Puksas was nominated to the members of the CEC by the Lithuanian Lawyers' Society.
He will replace the Dream Šaltauskienė, delegated by the Society of Lawyers who has left her.

This party does not have its own representative in the CEC when Donatas Laurinavičius withdrew from it.
During the secret ballot, A. Puks' candidacy was supported by 74 members of the Seimas, 5 were against, and 6 parliamentarians abstained.

Plump girls break stereotypes about wedding dresses
Plump girl with white blown bridal dress - mission (not) possible?
Can a white swan that swims towards the altar be larger than S or M in size and still look attractive?
Participants in the plus-sized reality show "The Evolution of the Size (r)" will prove today that the bride's beauty and elegance really does not depend on the woman's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the girls on the project will be shedding tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the set.
"There are still some who think that the bigger girls don't get the attention or looks of the guys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me as I am, he doesn't require a figure that meets some standards," Aurika, the show's participant, will speak before performing with her wedding dress.
The wedding dress is not light, in every sense, a garment - it is a complex construction, it contains a lot of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident.
I can reassure you that a properly chosen dress model really solves this "problem"," explained one of the show's jury members, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The fates of girls in the project are decided by R. Kalinkin together with the whole commission - Erika Vitulskienė, who opened a plus-sized fashion house, photographer and social networking star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukste.
"When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there are a lot of quarrels between the members of the commission - after all, we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show differently.
The wedding dress demonstration task was made even more difficult and this - I can now reveal - that two newbies appeared that were certainly not inferior to the incumbent.
It was a special evening in every sense," Kalinkin says.
Newbies - 23 years of scandalous behavior in one summer reality show famed Eve and 31 years of exceptional beauty mother of two children Dovile - like other girls participated in the selection of "Size (r) evolution" and was in the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first extremely open photo shoot of girls on the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The show's girls were returned to the LNK by viewers who voted for their favorites on the television portal.
The reality show of plump beauties, which has received international recognition, is already in its second week in Lithuania - here plus size girls compete for the name of the first star in the country plus size.
So far, there are only eight of them left - and they all understand perfectly well that there can only be one winner.
An intriguing and unpredictable week of reality show "The Evolution of the Size (r)" begins as early as this Monday evening at 8:30 p.m. via LNK.
Actor I. Elba selected as the sexiest man in the world
U.S. magazine People has declared this year's sexiest man in the world.
It became Idris Elba, a 46-year-old British actor.
Although the man claims that this message was unexpected, he did not lack wit when telling about the new title.
I thought, "It can't be!
Seriously?".
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, today I look sexy - with a laugh shared by the actors.
Speaking frankly, Idris identified that this title, it's an extremely pleasant feeling that patted his ego.
The British star claims to have often received abusive words and bullying, which made his childhood difficult, since, as he himself calls it, he was "very tall and clumsy".
The young actor would not please his peers and would become the subject of bullying and because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"As soon as I grew my mustache and muscles, I became the coolest guy in my city district," Idris smiles.
When a man is no longer on the bigOse screens, Elba works as a disco at parties held in Spain, and especially in the bustling Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a vein for fashion, which he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor claims that his family is the most important thing to him in the world, so he plans a wedding with his fianb Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the 33rd person in the world to be chosen by People magazine as the sexiest man in the world.
In 2017, the title was given to Blake Shelton.
A man beaten to death during a drink in the Širvintų district
On Monday evening, a man was beaten to death during a drink in the village of Šalkiškės in Širvintai district.
According to Vilnius County Police, at 9:16 p.m., a report was received that a man had beaten a neighbor during a drink.
Upon arrival, medics stated the death of a man born in 1943.
The 1994-born suspect, who was found to be 2.53 percent drunk, was arrested.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the incident.
Those in power no longer demand a distance of 20 km in the construction of waste-incineration plants
Vilnius cogeneration power plant is under construction, near Gariūnai market.
Those in power no longer seek to maintain a distance of 20 kilometers from settlements when building waste-incineration plants.
Kęstutis Mažeika, the head of the Environmental Protection Committee, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Law in the Seimas on Monday, refusing such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mažeika, the "Farmers" faction, which had previously supported the provision for a distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr. Mažeika's amendment provides that from January 2019 waste-incineration plants could be built in accordance with statutory environmental and public health protection requirements.
He admits that the amendments were prompted by the president's doubts about such a ban.
"Given the definition of a residential area, it is clear that places where the above objects could be built would be almost impossible to discover," the committee's chairman states.
The ruling majority in October opposed the president's veto amendments tightening the construction of waste-incineration plants.
In addition to banning the construction of waste-incineration plants closer than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided for permission for the Government to make decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account public health interests.
The latter provision is not proposed by Mr. Mažeika to be corrected.
In Vilnius, the waste and biofuel power plant is being built by the energy group Lietuvos Energija, and in Kaunas, together with Fortum Lithuania, a Finnish energy concern.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipėda.
Talks about possible compromise in Brexit talks
British and Irish leaders discussed on Monday a possible compromise on the difficult Northern Ireland issue stalling Brexit negotiations, Dublin reported.
In a phone call, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered the possibility of revising the so-called backstop arrangement mechanism, which would allow an open border to be left between the British province of Northern Ireland and the European Union-owned Republic of Ireland.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider the proposal, but ruled out any option for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the agreement, the Irish government said in a statement.
In a conversation, May "raised the possibility of revising the backstop mechanism," it said.
"Varadkar has made it clear that it is open to revision of new proposals, provided that the result of such revision is not related to a unilateral decision to end the application of the backstops," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators find no acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain exits the single market and customs union in March next year.
Both sides agree on "backstops" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger-scale trade agreement is signed to ensure no further customs checks are carried out at the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants it to temporarily apply to the UK as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was seeking to allow Britain to withdraw from the backstop agreement unilaterally after three months.
However, Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support this".
"Three-month or limited-term backstops are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he stated.
Earlier, London and Brussels had not confirmed details of a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations following a report in Britain over the weekend that a deal was within reach.
"I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done," said May's spokesman in London.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters, "We're not there yet."
Nobel laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the internet era to guarantee the right to reliable information.
Among the 25 individuals who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen (Amartja Sen) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglitz), Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), as well as Nobel Literature Prize-winning writer Mario Vargas Llosa (Marius Vargas Liosa).
"We call on goodwill leaders on all continents to take steps to strengthen democratic models and open public debate through which citizens can make decisions based on facts," the group said in a statement.
They argue that the "global information and communication space" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and views".
"People have a fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated, based on the principles of commitment to truth, plurality of viewpoints, and rational methods of fact-finding," the authors of the declaration added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who often criticizes "fake news" but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
World leaders are expected to express their position on the issue when they gather for the "Peace Forum" to be held in Paris on November 11-13, the signatories called for.
This declaration was drafted within two months under the leadership of Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, head of the Paris-based Freedom of the Media and Protection of the Rights of Journalists Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao, and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
Seimas approves higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Act, which provides that fines for product safety violations must be increased.
The amendments were passed unanimously in the chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Health Affairs Committee, said, in terms of the new project, it is welcome that the stated goals are related to better product consumer protection.
In addition, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"In my opinion, the proposed bill distributes more perfectly and specifically to all those involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current penalty system does not always prevent further violations, as the entities that have paid fines continue to commit repeated violations," Vinkus said.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, and after the approval of the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase fines for infringements, strengthen consumer rights protections, empower market surveillance authorities, and create a clear framework for monitoring product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the market surveillance authorities have not been granted access to the manufacturers' and suppliers' territory, buildings, premises, and inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry's assessment, the six-month deadline for imposing fines and warnings is too short to determine the violation, to conduct an investigation and to impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product, thus ensuring its traceability, so as to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to access, through state control of product safety, inspections of economic entities that manufacture, supply products to the market, territory, buildings, premises.
The intention is to increase the fines for violations of the law.
A fine of between €150 and €2,500 (now €144 to €1,448) would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who placed dangerous products on the market, and the distributor who made them available on the market, the service provider who provided dangerous services or provided them.
A fine of between €1,000 and €5,000 (now €868 and €4,344) would be imposed if the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing and placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between 2,500 and 6,500 euros (now between 1,448 and 5,792).
If dangerous products caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of between €2,500 and €15,000 (now between €1,448 and €1,1584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the consumer's death, a fine of between €6,500 and €25,000 (now between €5,792 and €23,169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to €25,000 (no minimum fine) is imposed for violating product safety legislation, in Belgium a fine of between €26 and €600,000, in Romania a fine of between €155 and €6,666, and in Bulgaria a fine of between €125 and €7,500.
10-year-old had baby: was raped by family member
The event in Colombia stunned millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl raped by her older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby saw the world thanks to a caesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
They were under medical supervision for a time.
It is still some time before the young mother and baby are released home.
"Based on the information I received from police officers, the young girl became pregnant after she was sexually abused by a family member - a brother," the director of the hospital where the birth was received told a foreign television station.
Police are investigating the incident for rape and child abuse.
The Norwegian Armed Battalion participated in NATO exercises in the outermost and harshest areas
Troops from the Norwegian Armed Forces participated in a series of complex exercises in the mountains located north of the country's capital Oslo.
It is part of NATO's "Trident Link 2018" exercise - the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the troops from Norway's second battalion of military forces spent a lot of time away from home, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
But most of all they are skilled at warfare in the Arctic, and these skills are extremely useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinsett, often in the outermost and harshest areas, soldiers have participated in staged battles against real British soldiers.
Warriors have the skills to survive in this cold wild, but in the harsh climate they have to stretch a lot more weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers in command say they share their skills on how to survive and fight under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the troops, this exercise, which like no other is particularly reminiscent of real warfare, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

After leaving Kaunas, the vice mayor does not plan to return to politics
Former Kaunas Vice Mayor Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in the municipality and "United Kaunas" organization due to his support for Vygaudas Ušackas in the presidential election, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
"I'm going to focus on business.
I am a shareholder in several companies and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to devote more time to the family," P. Mačiulis told BNS.
He also said he had no plans to participate in the upcoming municipal elections.
P. Mačiulis had not yet had the opportunity to speak with V. Ušackas after he lost the primary elections of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrida Šimonytė on Sunday.
"To be honest, we have not yet been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and tell them about the plans for the future.
It is clear that when Vygaudas withdrew from the further electoral struggle this stage of my life is over," said P. Mačiulis.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas politics due to his support for V. Ušackas, only regretted that "Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a true leader in the context of international relations".
P. Mačiulis worked briefly as Deputy Mayor of Kaunas in 2011, and later returned to this position after the successful election of "United Kaunas" in 2015.
He is a shareholder in the private school "Erudito Lyceum" and several other companies.
Kaunas Castle is full of workers: what are they doing here?
When the residents of Kaunas noticed the workers working in Kaunas Castle, they hoped that the reconstruction works of the surviving tower were finally underway.
Gabrielius Sužiedėlis, the director of Kaunas City Museum, assured the portal that there is a south-western tower with a fragment of the defensive wall for changing the cover of protective roofs.
According to the interviewer, the canopies will be cans.
"The worn-out canopy cover of the emergency was a threat to those around us - people could fall in and get injured - so it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so heritage was also damaged," explained the museum's director.
Will these canopies be similar to those a few centuries ago?
"All the work is in harmony with heritage and other institutions," G. Injured added, aiming to make the result as authentic as possible, but also the practical side is important - the roofs must protect the values from moisture.
A universal solution has been chosen when working with heritage.
Before that, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered in tin as early as Soviet times, so they no longer had historical value," the director of the Kaunas City Museum detailed.
The work contract was signed on October 2.
The works are scheduled to last no more than three months from the signing of the contract.
"It is expected to be completed by the end of November," the museum's director taught expectations.
According to him, the value of the works performed amounts to almost 24,000 euros.
This amount, according to an interviewer, was provided in this year's budget.
Works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company "Statija".
Kaunas.day.lt has written, as according to research conducted, Kaunas Castle may have looked earlier.
U.S. and South Korea resume naval exercises
Now for two weeks, the southern town of Pohang will host a naval exercise with approximately 500 troops, the Ministry of Defence reported in Seoul.
The United States has 28,500 soldiers stationed in South Korea.
The two countries have been holding joint military maneuvers for years, which Pyongyang calls "provocation" and "preparing for an invasion".
On Friday, North Korea threatened to resume its nuclear program if Washington did not lift economic sanctions against Pyongyang.
Such a change in course could be "seriously considered", the North Korean foreign ministry said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a television interview that the punitive measures would remain until Pyongyang gave up its nuclear weapons.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.

The Center for Eastern European Studies will collaborate with two prominent "brain centers" in the United States
According to Linas Kojala, the head of the SOCC, which is based in Vilnius and is already counting its thirteenth year of operation, the U.S. networking will allow projects to be implemented and will make Lithuania's voice more audible on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am glad that two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will emerge as the topics of NATO, security, misinformation, and development of the Eastern Partnership states that we analyze are also a priority for them," Kojala said.
The agreements note that the ESC and U.S. institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expertise and expertise, and conduct expert visits.
This should be of particular benefit to Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
FPRI has been in operation since 1955 and brings together nearly a hundred top-level analysts.
In the most recent ranking of analytical centers compiled by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI ranked seventh in its category.
At the time, the CEPA, whose analysts have been repeatedly invited to advise and work for top U.S. political institutions, is ranked tenth in its category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to break into the US information space and encourage us to raise the quality bar," added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be to help partners in distributing the soon-to-be-released RESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among U.S. decision makers and in the public domain.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of ongoing projects and is not supported by targeted grants.
The partners of the RESC with which joint initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseille
Two people were lightly injured in the collapse of two buildings in the southern French city of Marseille on Monday, the fire service said.
As the buildings collapsed, debris broke into the street, and dust clouds rose.
Dozens of firefighters worked at the scene near Marseille's famous old port, some with trained dogs.

Officials said they were looking for people who may have been trapped under the rubble.
Marseille firefighters reported on Twitter that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
The amateur video, shown by BFM-TV television, shows clouds of dust on the street and passers-by covered in their mouths with their sleeves.
Google Street View photos taken before the incident show that one of the collapsed buildings was five-story and the other six-story.

Afghan special forces member shot dead American instructor during training
Brent Taylor, the 39-year-old mayor of North Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, was on a year-long vacation to carry out his mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the Joint Force Headquarters, but had to return to serve as mayor in January.
Another member of the U.S. military, whose name is not yet public, was wounded in an attack on Saturday that claimed Taylor's life.
According to officials, Taylor died of infantry gun fire.
Major General Jefferson S. Burton, commander of the Utah National Guard, told reporters that Taylor had helped train and strengthen the capabilities of the Afghan National Army.
