Welsh Assembly members concerned that they "look like dolls"
Some members of the Assembly were surprised by the proposal to change their name to MWP (English: Welsh Member of Parliament).
This is related to the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly are concerned that at the political level this could lead to ridicule.
A member of the Labour assembly said his group was concerned "that it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: Welsh "twp" means "fool" and pwp means "okay".
A member of the Plaid assembly said the group as a whole was "unsatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" about changing the name, but noted that it was a shortening of the word from MWP to "doll".
The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English word u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on draft legislation to change the name, said: "The final decision on the names of all members of the Assembly will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that received strong support from the Assembly to name the Welsh Parliament.
As for the name of the Assembly members, the Commission preferred Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP received the most support during the public consultation.
Members of the assembly obviously offer alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement can become a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will also include other changes to the Assembly's work, including rules on disqualification of an Assembly member and a plan for a committee system.
During the debate on legislation, members of the Assembly will have a decisive say on the question of how they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote was held to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name implies claims to Greek territory and repeatedly opposed Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Opposing the plebiscite on changing the name, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
During Harlem's difficulties, the bells of St. Martin's and other churches were silent
"The old people I talked to said that historically you could find a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
You won't find one or the other today."
He said it was understandable why the bars disappeared.
"People communicate differently these days," he said.
"Bars are no longer a neighborhood site where people are constantly gathering."
Referring to churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the property will not be long enough, as the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced with apartment blocks with co-operative apartments that would house people who would not help the shrines that remained nearby.
"Most of the people who will buy cooperative apartments in these apartment blocks will be white," he said, "and will therefore hasten the moment the churches close completely because it is unlikely that most of these people who have moved into these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built in 1870 by white congregations, before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community, and St. Martin's Church was built a decade later.
The primary congregation of white Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation, which held nearby services, took over the building's name.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation with clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers at 125th Street, Harlem's main store, which refused to recruit or appoint blacks to senior positions.
In 1939, the building was badly devastated by a fire, but since the parishioners of the spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
The priest David Johnson, the son and heir of the spiritual father Johnson in St. Martin's Church, called the carillon the bells of the poor with pride.
Experts who starred in the carillon in July called it otherwise, a "cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also mentioned that it was the world's first carillon played by black musician Dionisio A. Lindas. 18 years ago he began playing a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him with another musician.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months has been a complicated story involving architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by church laymen, and others by the Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
Zacristia, a parish governing body made up of lay leaders, expressed to the diocese in July concerns that the diocese would "try to shift costs" to the sacristy, even though it did not hire architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
Shark in California injures 13-year-old who catches lobster
Officials reported that a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he caught lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster-catching season.
It was attacked before 7:00 a.m. in Ensinitas near Lighthouse Beach.
Chad Hammel told the San Diego KSWB-TV show that he dived with friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy yelling for help, and then came with a group to help get him out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was worried about catching the lobster, but then realized that the boy was shouting, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone had been ripped off.
"I started shouting to everyone to climb out of the water: 'A shark swims in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown by plane to San Diego's Rady Children's Hospital, where he was admitted to be in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper torso.
Officials closed the beach from Casablad Ponto to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours due to investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the zone, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to push into UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty departments staffed by specialist consultants.
Actively pushing into the UK's $2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow and fashion and household goods sales rates are falling, larger beauty product divisions will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, more stores will be installed next year.
Investments in beauty are growing, and supermarkets are looking at ways to use shelves once designed for televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's announced it would double its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, and Tweezerman and for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space in brand areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The mall also re-releases its Boutique make-up range, most of which are vegan, which is increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will try out discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open later this year in Seli Oak, Birmingham.
Due to online shopping and the desire to buy small quantities from local essentials stores daily, supermarkets need to do more to attract people to visit there.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said the branded outlets are increasingly looking like department stores as supermarket chains try to combat selling cheaper Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's included Argos's outlets in hundreds of stores and also set up a number of Habitat stores, as they bought both chains two years ago, which are said to have boosted grocery sales and made their acquisition more profitable.
A previous attempt by the mall to upgrade its beauty and pharmacy department ended in failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended in a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from pharmacy stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business in 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, three years ago for a sum of ?125 million.
Lloyds' contribution to this plan was claimed to add an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Sainsbury's commercial director Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We've changed the exterior and atmosphere of beauty departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and because of its attractive environment and convenient locations, we are now an attractive place for beauty, challenging the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "infuriated" by Holly Willoughby's termination of an 11-million-pound deal with him
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has been "furious" after television show host Holly Willoughby ended an 11-million-pound deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Mr Willoughby no longer has time for their household and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning's show announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby's leaving a lucrative lifestyle brand at the last moment to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when a gold television girl at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that new deals of up to $1.5 million would make it impossible for her to devote time to his household goods and accessories brand Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's trademark Goop, and was assumed to have doubled Mr Willoughby's assets of ?11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his summer homes.
The source said: Truly has been one of Holly's top priorities so far.
This was to be her long-term future, lasting for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave everyone was extremely surprising.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the start was so close.
There is a complete storehouse of ready-to-sell goods at Marlowe's headquarters."
Experts believe the departure of The Morning, one of Britain's most financially successful stars, could cost the company millions in large investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, as well as delays in getting things started.
And it could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, H. Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been in close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
In 2016, Willoughby co-founded Truly with T. Capp, and 52-year-old Mr. Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together, and Mr. Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
H. Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin, host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity show.
A close Jones source said yesterday, "We will not comment on his business dealings."
We talked hard and "then we fell in love"
He joked about receiving criticism from the media about the comment being made, which some might consider "non-presidential", as well as the fact that he is so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
A brief mocking voice from the "news presenter" said:
"I didn't give up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was seen as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, nuclear disarmament talks stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not receiving a "relevant response" from the United States regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
He noted that the U.S. was instead continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We are now in this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: it was the end of missile testing, aid in releasing the hostages, and the return of the remains of American soldiers home.
He defended his unusual attitude by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people to get into this stuffy arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing at the crowd standing right in front of him.
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake devastated island, killing hundreds
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was deployed, this was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been made very clear that international aid is not needed, so it's a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work locally.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute.
In light of Indonesia's ongoing earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters from the tsunami were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
Due to the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens, Palu is likely to have increased the number of lost lives despite the announcement of a warning.
The best time to travel between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo chose the rebuilding of Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure as the center of his election campaign, and he generously spent money on roads and railroads.
However, the lack of funding has not bothered the Yoko administration, as he will be running again in the coming years.
Yoko also faces pressure from the lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members follow a more conservative form of belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows with arrows and other simple weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a distant equalising goal in a game with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League match in the 89th minute after scoring a goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
As their team trailed by a score of 1:0, Xherdan Shaqiri handed the ball to Sturridge, who was about 30 metres from Chelsea's gate.
He shifted the ball on his left foot and hit towards the long range.
A ball raised high above the penalty area flew into the right upper corner of the net.
He eventually passed over the dancing Kepa Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
"I was just trying to get the ball going and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to keep as much time as possible for the hit," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante running away, I got the ball right with one touch and, without thinking too much, I just kicked."
Following a goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute, Chelsea took a 1:0 lead from the first quarter.
During that attack, the Blues striker returned the ball in the middle of the field with a heel to Mateo Kovaci and hurried towards Liverpool's side.
This one quickly played a wall in the middle of the square.
He then aptly sent the ball between the opponents to the penalty area for the advancing Hazard.
Hazard overtook the defenders and past Liverpool player Alisson Becker, he deflected the ball into the net at a long distance oscillation with a left leg stroke.
Liverpool team will play with Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo (Italy) on Wednesday in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m.
Chelsea meet Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll already stands at 832
As reported by the country's disaster agency early on Sunday, the death toll in Indonesia from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832.
Agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake that caused the 6-metre waves.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000 people, was laid down in the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Berkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. near Grayson Muse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people who had seen or heard anything in the area to speak out.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "For now, the investigation stage is early, but I would like to address anyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to get in touch with us.
I would also like to address anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something with a video recorder, and would contact us because they may have information that is essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Berkenhead and she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police have reported informing the victim's immediate relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one could enter or leave the building.
He lost his promise when he found out what had happened.
Residents have now been informed that they will have to wait a few hours before being allowed to return home.
A police officer was heard explaining to one person that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared tearful at the crime scene.
She kept saying, "It's so scary."
At 2 p.m., two police vans stood in front of the barrier on the inside side, and another van behind it on the outside side.
Numerous officers stood on the inner side of the barrage and watched the block of apartment blocks.
Anyone who has information is asked to write to the #MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by phone at 0800 555 111, with the September 30 number 247.
Parliament's Cromwell statue is hit with the final blow of a "rewriting of history" dispute.
Its removal would be poetic justice for the Taliban's action-like destruction of England's cultural and religious heritage, for which the fanatical followers of the Cromwell Puritans are responsible.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "stupid" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the course of the current debate on moving the statues, Oliver Cromwell's statue at Westminster Palace was inevitably to become a target.
Cromwell did not order or enforce the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft, Cromwell's magnificent image is a reflection of a 19th-century view and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of homage.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more numerous in the late 19th century than today, Cromwell was seen as a defender of parliament against external pressure, which was of course a monarchy.
Whether this is perfectly accurately depicted, historians argue to this day.
One is clear that the mid-17th-century conflict shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this divide.
His achievements as Lord's protector are also worthy of mention and honor."
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and tore a farmer to death in a market in southwestern China.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a dead man, surnamed Yuan, had been found, having been blood-stained due to a damaged artery, and was lying next to a piggy at Liupanshui Market, Guizhou Province (south China).
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Sining, Qinghai, China, was preparing to inject vaccines for pigs in a pig.
He announced that he and his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province were going to travel to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found a relative dead and found a door open to a nearby pig.
He said there was a large boar in the pig whose mouth was stained with blood.
According to the report, forensics confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms tore the farmer to death.
Guiyang Evening News quotes: "My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin, who gave his surname Wu, .
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal Yuan or his cousin was not torn by the man.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had to be locked up to stop attacking other people and held while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the deaths.
Although few, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly dangerously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 kilograms pinned a Welsh farmer to a tractor and pressed until the animal was chased down by his wife.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but the aggressiveness may be driven by the taste of blood.
"They're just playful.
They like biting, very curious... not inclined to harm anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's "remains" will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken, moving through the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, over the coming days, Rosa will bring abundant rain to all of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday from 5:00 a.m., Rosa was moving at a speed of 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km southwest of Cape Euchenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific side is beginning to form extended areas of low pressure and is moving eastward, towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, she will begin to carry high tropical moisture north, to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimetres of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Then tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching extended low pressure area, will bring widespread abundant rain to the southwest over the coming days.
At the site, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding, a stream of debris, and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall of 5 to 8 centimetres per hour in some areas, especially southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5 to 6 centimeters is expected in southwestern regions, especially much of Arizona.
Due to the disparate nature of tropical rains, flash flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions are possible.
In the face of a tropical storm, a particularly poor idea would be to draw into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can transform canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms would cause wind and dust surges.
The approaching extended low pressure area will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
More than 1 centimeter of rainfall is likely to occur, which can cause a small flow of debris, and roads can become slippery.
This would be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some erratic tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and later rain will spread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread across Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible across the United States as the Arctic cools, but will be quite warm in the tropical zone.
Sometimes this results in huge temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday was a great example of huge temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperatures of Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, are nearly 20 degrees different from those of St. Louis and Di Moin, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
In much of the central and eastern United States, from the Great Southern Plains to the northeastern areas, it is expected that a warm October will arrive with temperatures of 27 degrees in many places.
In New York, temperatures are expected to rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that temperatures in the eastern United States will be above average perennial temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the fighting remarks of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the accusations of sexual violence by woman Christine Blasey Ford during six television broadcasts on Thursday.
However, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs due to Friday's last-minute change: the Arizona Senator drafted an agreement to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the dropped charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, who had drunk at a high school party, had groped her and tried to tow off her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in an angry testimony that he was absolutely certain that this was not the case.
Nielsen reported on Friday that possibly more than 20.4 million people watched the broadcast.
The company estimated the average number of viewers who watched the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in counting individuals watching television in offices.
To explain it more understandably, it is an audience of the same size as would occur during a playoff football game or an Oscar award.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, was leading from all networks when the number of viewers reached an average of 5.69 million in a full-day court hearing.
ABC, which received 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS received 3.1 million, NBC received 2.94 million, MSNBC received 2.89 million, and CNN received 2.52 million.
Much interest remained after the trial was over.
The main figure in Friday's drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he tried to take the elevator to a Court Committee hearing.
CNN directly filmed him with lowered eyes as he was floated by people.
"I'm standing here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and added that he would have more to say at the Court Committee meeting before the elevator closed.
Cable television and broadcast networks later discussed directly when the Judiciary Committee voted for Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate.
Still, Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, an investigation that was called for by the Democratic minority.
Flake, who spoke to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was persuaded in part.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh's absence from the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, accused her plans to leave the European Union to criticise those "playing politics" with Britain's future and to harm the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published under her photo on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Brexit-designated "Shashki" plan that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs, saying it was "totally absurd".
Shooting of Wayde Sims Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson over death of LSU player
Police arrested a person suspected of the shootings that resulted in the death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge police department reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and put in prison on charges of second-degree murder.
Officers posted a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police mentioned that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS affiliate WAFB reports that police took glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he shot Wayde to death.
The lawyer informs that his release deposit is $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Expert Service released a preliminary report on Friday that mentions that the cause of death is a shot in the head that deviated to the neck.
The department awards merit to the Louisiana State Police's Fugitives Task Force, the state's police crime lab, Southern University's police, and district residents who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the district's law enforcement for "thoroughness and the administration of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 1.98 metre tall guy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, the young man averaged 5.6 points and caught 2.6 rebounds during the game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked".
"It's something that's been thought about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano spits ash in Mexico City
Ashes erupted from the Popocatepetl volcano, which reached the southern vicinity of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano when increased crater activity was recorded and gas and ash emissions were recorded 183 times in 24 hours.
The center observed numerous thunders and quakes.
Photos on social media show car windshields covered with a thin layer of ash in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Chochimilk.
Geophysicists have noted that the activity of the volcano 72 km southeast of the capital has increased since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters clashed with riot police for independence and thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's split vote.
Riot police stopping a group of masked separatists were swamped with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Police used batons to end the fighting that began later in the day.
Within hours, groups for independence chanting "Unforgettable, Unforgivable" encountered Unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain!"
Local media reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is sung by Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
The majority of voters chose to become independent, but due largely to those who boycotted the vote who did not want to secede, voter turnout was low.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes as police across the region tried to stop voting in polling stations last year.
The independence-supporting groups set up a camp on Friday night to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change the route.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician involved in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer certain of Catalonia's prospect of independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I watched my parents shout joyfully for those who can vote, but we are now stuck," he said.
Despite tearing off a vital and hard-won victory in regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year as many of their most well-known leaders withdrew to voluntary exile or are detained and awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and later declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic supporting the police who filmed the protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"Tensions are constantly rising," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed in pre-trial since late last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections the following year.
"Candidatizing in the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Detained men entering house by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after repeatedly driving into a house in Londonderry in a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. (BVL) at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, a crossbow could also be fired at the car.
Menga's blow secured Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Livingston player Dolly Menga's first goal guaranteed victory
Moving to the higher league, Livingston surprised the Rangers, forcing Ibrox club manager Steven Gerrard to lose the second of 18 games.
Dolly Menga's blow proved to be very important as Gary Holto's team matched up with the Hibernian in a moment.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated in this Premier League season and will meet the leaders at Hearts next Sunday, on which they are eight points behind.
Prior to that, the Rangers will play the Europa League games at home with the Vienna Rapid on Thursday.
At the time, Livingston had lengthened their unbeaten series of undefeated matches in the division to six, and head coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of defeat, as Kenny Miller only replaced last month.
"Livingston misses chances in match with steeplechase guests"
Even before scoring a goal, Holt's team had to be in the front for a long time due to its persistence raising Rangers' various problems.
Initially, Scott Robinson broke through and punched across the gate, then Alan Lithgow was unable to reach Craig Halkett's head handed over the ball while slipping and this one rolled off near the gate.
The hosts, allowing the Rangers to play in the front, were not worried because they knew they could make trouble for guests by creating standard positions.
That is how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free kick and Livingston began to push forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined efforts to pass the ball to Menga, who scored a goal from the middle of the penalty area when he stopped it.
Since then, the ball has been under the control of Rangers for longer, but the hosts' defense has been insurmountable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no job.
Such a furrow game continued in the second half, although Kelly had to work to counter Alfredo Morelos' blow to the gate.
Scott Pittman's shot at Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor hit the leg, and after another Livingston standard position, the ball sent by Lithgow's punch flew near the gate.
The ball being handed over regularly ended up in the Livingston penalty area, but every time it was kicked out and two demands for a penalty kick, one due to Halkett's collision with Glenn Middleton, who had run in after the change, and the other due to the ball touching his hand, were not met.
An Analysis of the Phenomenal Performance of Livingston
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and score for Livingston.
For all to one, they were great and continued to exceed expectations for an ever-improving game.
The style and staff of the game have not changed much since his return to the top league, but it is appropriate to devote great merit to Holt, as he ignited the team upon arrival.
He was assisted by numerous heroes.
Captain Halkett played brilliantly, concentrating on a perfectly organized defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Worralla not to lose vigilance.
Still, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although under Gerrard's leadership, they play well, but this time they were far short of reaching their level.
They hit little decisive hits and only broke through the hosts' defense once. Some anxiety call to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has been met in Cologne in various ways
On Saturday (September 29), there were smiles and blue skies when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the final day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to restore relations between NATO allies.
Leaders have argued over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population community outside Turkey.
Police barred the assembled 25,000 people from platooning in front of the mosque for safety, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to meet him in their country.
Different protests show a division of visitors: some German Turks consider him a hero, while others flood him and call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist died in London after colliding with a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy Deptford Road, in the southeast of the city, at approximately 10.15 a.m. BVL.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics also arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed in Childers Street, hit by the perpetrator, who then escaped. This accident occurred about 1.6 km from the Saturday accident.
City police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his immediate relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes have been altered, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
"Long Lartino" prison: Six officers injured in turmoil
The prison service reported that six prison officers were injured in a major upheaval in a special security men's prison.
The turmoil occurred at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09.30 BVL, where it is still ongoing.
Special Tornado officials have been called in to contain this turmoil, which involves eight inmates and takes place in one wing of the prison.
Officers are treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "In order to contain the ongoing incident, specially trained prison staff were called to HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six personnel were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are assured that those responsible will be handed over to the police and, possibly, will spend a longer period behind bars."
More than 500 prisoners are held in HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that a prison manager was being treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, riot officials were called to the prison to manage a serious breakdown in which some workers were stabbed with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with its flash floods (dry areas may benefit from this)
It is not common for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this is what will likely happen next week, when Hurricane Rosa with its remaining energy will stretch through the desert southwest and it will cause a risk of flash flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already announced it is monitoring a flash flood on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, spreading towards southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Coming up with the rain late Monday, Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday.
In Phoenix, the National Meteorological Service mentioned that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status no more than 322 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane not more than 64 kilometers from the Arizona border."
Applying the latest models of the National Hurricane Center, it is predicted that prills will be 5 to 6 centimeters of rainfall, while some parts of Arizona's Mogolon Rim will have rainfall of 5 centimeters.
Other areas of the desert southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.5 and 5 centimetres, and in some places can fall up to 10 centimetres of rainfall.
For people not at risk of flash floods, the Rose Rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some may benefit from these precipitation, as the southwest is currently suffering from droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40% of Arizona is suffering from a very severe drought, which corresponds to the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels towards the coast across the California Peninsula, which is part of Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still equivalent to the hurricane category with a huge 137 km/h wind, is 619 kilometers south of Cape Euchenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific region and therefore rhymes.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday at lunchtime or in the evening.
Precipitation in certain parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
"From the California Peninsula to the northwest, Sonora is expected to reach 8 to 12 centimeters, but possibly up to 25 centimeters of rainfall," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm, then reach the Arizona border as early as a tropical depression on Tuesday morning, and head through Arizona late in the evening towards southern Utah.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remnants is very high levels of rain on the California Peninsula, Northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center reported.
These rains are believed to cause life-threatening flash floods, a flood of debris in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Assault in Midsamer Norton: Four persons arrested suspected of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were detained on suspicion of attempted murder after a stabbing 16-year-old guy was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsamer Norton in the Excelsior Terrace area, at around 04.00 a.m., according to BVL, on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and is now in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset police reported that a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area overnight.
The officers approached anyone who could have any mobile phone footage of what had happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh was "suffered by the wretchedness, anger of the Democratic Party".
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote we would like to reject the ruthless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a speech in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "experienced the wretchedness, anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified Thursday to Congress strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
On Saturday, the president said that "Americans saw that day how cool, noble, and brave Kavanaugh was.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, it is a lawyer with a sound reputation for public service," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while also speaking about the importance of Republican election activity in the midterm elections.
"There are five weeks left in our lives before the most important election.
I am not involved, although I am actually involved, he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump said Democrats were seeking to "resist and hinder".
Senior assistant GOP executives told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll continues to rise
Authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, many being hurled by giant waves hitting the beach when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered for the Palu City Beach Festival on Friday when waves of six metres high began to hit the coast after dark, many of them fatally hurling and destroying everything that happened on the road.
There was a magnitude 7.5 earthquake following the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, making them victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB Indonesia Disaster Reduction Agency, said in an information message in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it brought back cars, logs, houses, it hit everything that was on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before it hit the coast, the tsunami was traveling in the open sea at 800 km/h.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived in this way.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs of the disaster agency showed numerous buildings and shops being destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to be rocked by repeated strikes.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) reported that the energy released by Friday's extremely severe earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It has been reported that the tsunami may have intensified due to the geographical location of the city, as it is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, later adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the coast, located 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said communications networks "were completely paralyzed, so no information was received" from Dongala.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," a Red Cross spokesman said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were going to areas affected by the disaster.
It was argued that "this could already be considered a tragedy, but the situation could get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticised for failing to report that the tsunami had struck Palu, although officials said the waves came after the warning was issued.
In a shared social media amateur footage, a man can be heard on the top floor of the building, who frantically shouts about an approaching tsunami for people standing on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking down buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami disrupted power supply, cutting off communications networks around Palu, and making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
Authorities reported that troops from Jakarta and other cities began sending cargo planes with relief supplies, but that those evacuated were still in dire need of food and other essential supplies.
The city's airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
Doseba reported that when World Vision personnel from Dongala traveled safely to Palu City, where staff were sheltering in tarpaulin tents built in the office yard, the images were accompanied along the way.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began taking difficult steps to provide disaster relief, some people complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were banned from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, provision, and personnel employed from abroad can only help once the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster," Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani said.
"When the government says, 'Yes, this is a national disaster,' we can call for international aid, but such status has not yet been announced."
The second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing people hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would affect the grim history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono had learned two missing paragliders from the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As I am older in paragliding sports, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon detailed how within hours of the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, this news traveled around the paragliding sports community. He desperately sent messages using the WhatsApp app, to Palu's rivals who attended the beach festival.
However, his messages contained only one grey rather than two blue ticks.
"I think that means the messages were not received," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 while filling an ATM at the Newport on the Levee entertainment center
According to a Newport Police Department press release, thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's employee who filled out an ATM at the entertainment center Newport on the Levee.
"The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and ready to add more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man "went from behind the back of a Brink's employee" and stole the money bag for replenishment.
According to a press release, witnesses spotted several suspects who were fleeing the scene, but police were unable to determine the number of persons involved in the crime.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police by phone at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. The rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
After announcing the changes on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A person formerly officially known as Kanye West."
K. West, 41, had been called Ye for some time and named the eighth album by that name, which was released in June.
Changes began before Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
He has to replace singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Not only is this a shortening of the current professional name, K. West said earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when talking about the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and turned into simply Ye, which means a reflection of our good, evil, confusion, everything.
The album reflects more of who we are."
He is one of many well-known rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, Mr. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he preferred the names of Love and Brotherly Love.
Former West colleague JAY-Z would also change his name and use it with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
The Mexican politician Andres Manuel Lupez Obrador (abbreviated AMLO) promises not to use troops against civilians.
Mexico's President-elect, Andr-s-Manuel L-pez Obrador, promised never to use military forces against civilians as the country nears its 50th anniversary of bloody repression of students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in the "Tlatelolco" square "never to use military forces to tame the Mexican population".
On October 2, 1968, at a time when leftist student movements began throughout Latin America, representatives of military forces in the square fired on a peaceful demonstration, and 300 people were killed.
Lepez Obrador solemnly promised to support young Mexicans by subsidizing students monthly and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities involve young people in criminal groups.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
"As China becomes increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this area," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence specialist who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various U.S. government bodies published reports on artificial intelligence, even the fact that there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence in the U.S. at all.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year to take the lead in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and another breakthrough in artificial intelligence is expected," Lee said.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence achievement will be in the US, as Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book, Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, having invested in Face ++, one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that defeated Othello, the highest-ranking American player, and later was the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China affiliate.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology contests, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's "Robotics Challenge", and asked when there would be another one in order to help find more insightful people.
Lee said that U.S. scientists often have to work hard to win state grants.
"It's not China taking away academic leaders, it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired bright university minds in recent years to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen efforts on artificial intelligence.
"I think PhD students working in artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
In July 2017, China State Council announced its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said, China's National Fund for Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations spend money on U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) announced a $2 billion investment for the AI Next initiative.
NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, nothing has been done in the coming months about U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
Macedonians voted in Sunday's referendum to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, an action that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name implies claims to Greek territory and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on a proposed new name, but opponents nationalists say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts about whether voter turnout would reach the minimum 50% needed to bring the referendum into effect.
A referendum question on the voting card was put: "Are you in favour of NATO membership and the EU's approval of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, it is worth paying a price in order to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," 79-year-old Olivera Georgiyevska said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs said they would stick to the results of the vote and make them decisive.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old elector of the capital Skopje.
Macedonian parliamentarian Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško vote in a referendum held in Macedonia on changing the country's name to open the way to join NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of tents built by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads raised, not to enter through the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, will attract much needed investment.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said the result "Yes" would be "ensuring our future".
According to the results of a poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute last Monday, 30 to 43 percent of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, less than the required voter turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, 57 percent of respondents prepare to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote "Yes".
For a referendum to succeed, it must have 50 percent of the electorate plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious failure of pro-Western government policy since it took power last May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero beats all of Brighton's defense and profit goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton defense, and team Manchester City on Saturday, playing at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, achieved a 2-0 victory.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute, seemingly incredibly easy.
The Argentine striker received the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He passed between three Brighton defenders before breaking out into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four players wearing green shirts.
He broke through one defender, ahead of several others at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then passed the ball to the left where Sterling was.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero with one kick from the penalty area and this right-footed kick released the ball to the right side of the gate net, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," City CEO Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked that he would play 55-60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky that he scored that moment."
Still, it was Sterling who helped the Sky Blues to be the first to advance in this Premier League game.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball during that attack while in the deep of Brighton's court.
Along the left edge of the field between the two opponents, he handed the ball nicely to Leroy Sane.
Sane used a few kicks to drive the ball forward while Sterling was pushing toward the further hustle.
Sky Blues striker released the ball into the goal just before slipping out of the field.
At 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday, City meets Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match at the Zinsheim Arena in Rhein-Neckar, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a friendly game with the Rockies
After the Nationals dropped out of the playoffs, there were no more good reasons to force the restart.
A competitive Scherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to stay in the playoffs; in the national league West they are one point ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies, who beat the Nationals by a score of 5:2 on Friday night, at least secured a chance to get a preferential travel pass, but still have to try to secure the right to play in the first division.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to run out onto the pitch knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where a crowd of people and another team will gather, will probably be at the highest level we can reach this year.
Why not compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting composition of the Sunday match team, but they are clearly inclined to release Scherzer in this case.
Scherzer, who will be 34th in the barrel for this game, made a pitching workout on Thursday and will take the pitcher's position on his usual day of rest, Sunday.
Washington right-handed statistics for this season: 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 auts in 220 2/3 of the quarter.
Trump gives speech in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections, the president implicitly alludes to the situation regarding Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
"Everything we have achieved will be put on the balance in November.
There are five weeks left in our lives before perhaps the most important elections.
It's very important, I'm not running... but I'm actually running, that's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Then he continued, "You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how angry it is.
They don't care what they hurt, what they climbed over to get power and control; that's what they really want - power and control - but we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And you see that for the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "wicked, ugly, low-minded and unjust people."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused huge ovations among listeners.
"Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hm, how.
No, hm... no, I'm waiting for one--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour has lost its diversity of opinion.
They do not condone the outspoken opinion of
When Momentum activists in my local party voted in favor of distrusting me, I wonder if it should have come as a surprise.
I am, at last, the latest of the Labour MPs to be told that I am undesirable, and that's for my opinion.
My fellow parliamentarian Joan Ryan received similar threats as she stood resolutely against anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed in criticizing me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Because of the importance of responsible economic policy, because of national security, because of Europe, ironically, because of similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
A report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want many members to be involved in the meetings and that the meetings are productive."
For most of those eight years, when I'm a local Labour Party parliamentarian, Friday night's GC meetings were exactly that.
It is sad that the tone of many meetings today is not at all so and the promises of a "softer, more pleasant" policy have long since been forgotten, even if they have ever been enforced at all.
It is increasingly obvious that a different opinion is not tolerated within the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues, whose political views I had previously believed were similar, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and hold opinions I would never agree with, whether for national security or for the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and even no matter what - a tirade of insults pops up on social media to promote my recall, condemn the center's policies, and say I have no place in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I have been much more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to withstand an avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things of this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the same views party, and with every procedure of "distrust" or change in the electoral system, this party is getting inferior.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to encourage me not to jump out, not to speak so loudly, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not what I came into politics for.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a schoolboy, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which in the true sense of the word failed my entire school class, I have sought to win better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never concealed my policies, including recent elections.
Nobody in Nottingham East was in any way to be surprised by my political opinions and areas of disagreement with current leaders.
For those who encouraged this procedure on Friday, I can say that when the country digs towards Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and public services, I do not realize the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact one message I have at Nottingham Momentum is addressed to my constituents, members of the Labour Party (or not): I am proud to serve you and promise that no threats of recall or political expediency will stop me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
"Ayr"-"Melrose"- 38:17 The insurmountable "Ayr" conquers the tops of the tables
Two late attempts slightly distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved this moment of triumph in the spectacular, lavish game of the day at Tennent's Premiership.
The team now found itself at the top of the table, the only one unbeaten.
Ultimately, the victory was brought to them by flawless defense and well-exercised opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie may indeed feel pleased.
"We've put all the trials up through all the games that have been going on so far and we're still unbeaten, so I'm really happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr worked well, the players used their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, completed with results by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, released to the court by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to score, and Baggot stopped the non-result attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage by a penalty, when he scored in the middle of the competition and successfully completed his personal test, helping Ayr pull back with a score of 17:5 before the break.
Still, Melrose started the second quarter well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggott ended with results, narrowed the gap to five points.
The match was suspended for a longer period of time as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was taken off the batter. As the game continued, Ayr continued to push forward when Stafford McDowall's attempt was effectively completed by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose tried to take advantage of the players' surplus, but Bruce Colvine's attempt was counterproductive at the end of the fierce pressure.
The home team player returned, however, after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without the ball, MacPherson pinned the ball from the penalty line behind the continuing Ayr wrestling scene.
Climo's results ended his attempt, as he had done almost since the start of the game's reopening, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's kick into the corner of the field and prevented edge striker Gregor Henry from hosting a fifth home team attempt to score points.
'Still Game' star appears ready to launch new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears ready to move into the accommodation and catering sector after it is revealed that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, writing and playing the script alongside his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the final season of this show, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
Officially, he became director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on this fact, although Scottish Sun sources hinted that Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
'We own the sea': Bolivia jailed on land hopes trial will re-open its way to the ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The flag of ocean blue floats on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the slogan: "We rightly own the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
Throughout the land-incarcerated Bolivia, memories of access to the ocean, which had to be sacrificed for resources by Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century, are still alive and longing to be resurrected in the Pacific.
Hopes fostered in recent decades have now become particularly strong as, after five years of deliberations, Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling, to be announced on 1 October.
"Bolivia is concentrated in a spirit of unity and calm and, of course, hopes to get positive results," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will monitor the publication of the ruling by the ICC on large screens, in the hope that the Hague tribunal will make a positive decision on the Bolivian complaint - Chile will be obliged to negotiate access to the sea by the Bolivian state.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president Indian facing a controversial electoral battle for re-election, is also deeply interested in how Monday's decision will end.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised towards the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to believe that it is unlikely that the court will make a favorable decision for Bolivia, even if it did, little would change.
The Dutch-based UN body does not have the power to cut off Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision will not be published until six months after the last arguments were heard hardly indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
And even if Bolivia managed to make some headway, the last four years could knock it back.
"This issue of access to the sea has been raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," said the Z'rate.
She believes that any remnants of Chilean goodwill were destroyed by Morales' vengeful rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation at some point, but after all this, it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr-guez Veltz, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision was made unusually quickly.
"On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to launch an era of new relations with Chile and end 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla has also denied that Morales is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, and uses the sea issue as political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never relinquish the right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to come to terms with the past."
North Korea claims nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho assures that his nation will never give up its nuclear weapons first unless it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises, which rival country leaders agreed to at a meeting in Singapore.
His comments came at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to have intended to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after meeting Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the "utopian dream" is that continuing sanctions and the U.S. abandoning the declaration of an end to the Korean War could bring North Korea back sometime.
Washington avoids endorsing the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes credible disarmament action.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang has no serious intention of abandoning the arsenal, which the country seems to see as its only guarantee of security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to pave the way for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show has been revealed to be the latest trend in massive headgear, and they will soon conquer the nearest fashionable stores
If you want to supplement your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentrically large headgear in their spring and summer 2019 collections, and he simply stunned Paris Fashion Week viewers with his style.
These particularly impractical hats conquered the social network Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching pieces on the podium.
Valentino's distinctive creation was a huge body-colored hat decorated with a wide, feather-like edge enclosing the head of the dummy.
Other accessories of non-standard size were jewel-stamped watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn with their lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than the high fashion.
One of the pieces looked like a diver's suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, while the other resembled a nozzle of melted ice cream.
And if you follow this giant fashion trend, you won't ask.
Style experts speculate that these huge covers can get into the stores.
Huge hats became popular with La Bomba high heels, straw hats with two-foot edges were already worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created extremely impractical hats that conquered all social networks, released another huge piece on the podium, a straw beach bag, almost the same size as the model wearing a swimsuit carrying it.
The red-brick colored raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, became an exclusive highlight of Jacquemus' collection La Riviera SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I think huge hats and beach bags will come to the stores next summer because the designer has made such a big impact, so it would be hard to ignore the need for non-standard size accessories."
John Edward: "Language proficiency is a crucial skill for world citizens"
Scottish independent schools improved academic achievement records, without going down in 2018 as well, and once again demonstrated exceptional exam results that were only further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other community merit.
When a total of more than 30,000 pupils are enrolled across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide their students and their parents with the highest level of service possible.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and to be citizens of the world.
Working in the education sector, which can create and implement the intended school program, we can see that modern languages continue to be popular and are chosen willingly in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you can talk to a person in a language he understands, he will understand you with his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of this year's recent examinations, we can say that languages excel at the peak of popularity and have the best retention ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students received the highest A rating.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of pupils received the highest rating of A during the Mandarin language exam, the highest rating of A was given to 72 percent of those who studied German, as well as the highest rating of A was given to 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign language proficiency an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as an elective are now considered as important as basic subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that of all the reasons employers found it difficult to fill jobs, 17 percent had insufficient language skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly becoming mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
As access to employment will depend heavily on languages in the future, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses, learning a second language will make him significantly superior to others in the future if he has these lifelong skills needed.
By being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who knows several languages will be much more competitive.
According to a poll conducted by YouGov in 2013 involving more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to participate in the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for the children of the present.
By teaching several languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school varies according to the languages they teach.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK, looking to the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be many languages to choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and professionals in the field.
Scottish independent schools are ready to create a teaching environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills to live in the future.
It is undeniable that, in today's global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of the country, so it is also necessary to reflect this in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity for choice, diversity and results to Scottish youth.
This must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will begin his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
There is not much left for fans to wait to see LeBron James begin the season at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the Sunday season opening competition with the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But exactly how many minutes will play, it is not yet clear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James was likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about plans for the Lakers in six pre-season games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games to prepare," he said.
Trump speaks in West Virginia, on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins his campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned speeches by Trump next week, including stops in friendly-minded areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
By voting after approving the suspension procedure for the nomination of his chosen Supreme Court candidate, Trump seeks to focus support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time will Trump's speech take place this evening in West Virginia, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's speech in Willing, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time in the evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online in the following broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to touch on the topic of this week's Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, as she has been sowing a lot of tension over allegations of sexual misconduct when the Senate voted to suspend the nomination for a period of up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength in the run-up to the November election.
Therefore, representatives of President Trump's campaign say the goal of these five meetings next week, as reported by Reuters, is to "energise volunteers and supporters as Republicans struggle to defend and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress control is so important on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the very hot campaign season begins," said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to reveal his name.
"The speech planned for tonight at Willing's Wesbanco Arena is expected to attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who according to polls is in the ratings lows.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come in order to bump him to the top of the ratings," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup Tournament: U.S. team is at war and hopes to qualify for Sunday unit competition
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the fours may be just what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a fluctuation in success is entirely fictional, but players really believe it, especially in competitions like these.
So which side is success on now?
"They took the lead by six points, and now four, so I guess we can consider it a bit of a success," Jordan Spieth said in preparation for the day.
Of course, Europe is in the lead, has a four-point lead and is still waiting for twelve games.
American enthusiasm, according to Spieth, faded, and they lacked it, not to mention the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was insurmountable from start to finish and took the lead flawlessly.
As the round went on, those wild win screams became increasingly famous. In order to end the fourth match in a draw, Thomas scored two points out of two possible.
His blow, which earned them a win in this match at the 15th pit, was accompanied by similar cheers, which sort of said the American team was not yet in danger of an end.
"You just have to concentrate and take care only of your matches," Spieth said.
Now each of these players has been left to play separately.
By the successful end, there are 18 pits.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe scored four points out of four possible and can be calm.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not need additional hits, not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
That course of events and the reaction of the raging spectators only confirm that they will and will be the players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve the same popularity as Fleetwood or Molinari, who, after the last rays of descending sun have dimmed the field of Le Golf National, have a chance to secure a European victory.
It would be good for both to succeed in different pits at the same time.
Although it is too early to talk about European fame.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two double additional blows in the first nine-hole series put the Spaniard and the Swedes in trouble, from which they never managed to get out.
However, no one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four-ball and four-ball games are so interesting to watch because of the interaction between the pairs, because of the tips they give and do not give, and because the strategy can change instantly.
Europe played better as a team, so decisively leading came to the final, but this stage of the fours also showed that the U.S. team had a fighter backbone that some, especially in the states, questioned.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup competition, Europe lead 10:6
Europe will meet on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant lead, leading against the United States by a score of 10:6 after Saturday's four-round.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario continued to heat the atmosphere by winning two victories over the hard-fought Tiger Woods and taking the lead at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in order to preserve the trophy they had lost to Hazeltine two years earlier, dominated the morning fours against the unsuccessful American side and finished the stage with a score of 3:1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the fours when it won two games but failed to beat the scoring lead
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 unit games on Sunday to keep the trophy in his hands.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to manage to win four points in a row when he and Molinari duplicated Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second couple to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup competition history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fours, they flawlessly defeated trust-losing Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even better score of 5:4.
Woods, who had not otherwise defeated two Saturday games, showed a high level of professionalism at some points, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his games in fours, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose rested in the morning's fours and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the fours; they scored 2:1 against 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk, who were ranked first and third in the world rankings.
No matter the pleasant, gentle breeze-spinning day in the south-west of Paris, Europe did not go all the way through butter.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raised the bar for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
In a four-ball match, they won an uneasy 2:1 victory over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter, and in a four-ball match they beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4:3, without hitting the ball in the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did the team manage to regain a four-point lead by going into single games, although Furyk's side would have had enough of a draw to keep the trophy.
Although he was in second place for two days, the success on Sunday seems to have turned away from them.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally in any way, unable to trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen their distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would certainly not unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho's global organizations told the General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures" in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test base, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received a similar response from the U.S. side," he lamented.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., we will not be able to trust our national security, and under such circumstances we will by no means be the first to disarm unilaterally."
While Ri repeated North Korea's already heard complaints about Washington's opposition to the phased approach to nuclear disarmament, which would reward North Korea by taking steps in stages, his statement stood out by the fact that he had not completely ruled out the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on "disarming the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refuses to relax tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. demands nuclear disarmament first and increases pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal through coercive methods, even abandoning the declaration of an end to the war," Ri said.
"To think that sanctions can bring us back is like pursuing utopian dreams for people we don't care about.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted by the U.S. leader at the United Nations just earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: "If another country were South Korea on this nuclear disarmament issue rather than the United States, the issue of nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a stalemate."
However, Ri's tone of speech changed dramatically compared to last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that when "Mr. President of Evil" Trump called Kim a "missile gentleman" preparing a suicide mission, targeting North Korean missiles at the United States was absolutely inevitable.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, boasted to Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea met its nuclear disarmament requirements.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not scheduled a timeline for this, and said that "if it takes two years, three years, or five months to do so, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia said the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pomeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must be vigorously continued without any concessions until complete final evidence-confirmed nuclear disarmament has been carried out."
The Security Council has approved sanctions against North Korea since 2006 with all votes to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the backstage of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to scour the ground for the next meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the latter trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that all progress was only for North Korea to announce a few hours later that he had made "gangsterish demands".
North Korea promised during a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim said that the "appropriate measures" he was pursuing were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and a move to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of its students to sleep more in order to combat the growing culture of the match in the studios by consuming caffeine and not sleeping at night.
One academic found that in the best university in the world, students often do not even have basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigam City, a specialist in Women's Hospitals, has prepared a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for preparing this course visited him after talking about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I only being told about it now, in the final year of my studies?'
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep habits help to achieve academic and sporting results, and improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services department, said the university decided to offer this course when it became clear that students were severely short of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section contains a dormitory room photo where students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how sleep deprivation affects sports performance and how important walking to sleep routines is.
In the next section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the student campus with interactive icons that encourage participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We understand that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about health consequences when you choose to smoke," explained Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in not sleeping overnight, according to him, still exists. Modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to the growing problem of sleep deprivation.
"Ensuring that enough and quality sleep should be the students' secret weapon in combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety," he said, "even avoiding gaining weight because lack of sleep turns the brain into a fasting regime, so students are constantly feeling hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course when he attended one of his taught courses last year, his first years at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course available to the entire student campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all postgraduate students to listen to this course before beginning to attend this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm clock when it is time to go to sleep, just like lifting, and beware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and LED lighting as they can knock your circadian rhythm out of balance, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga goal upset Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another disappointment when Dolly Mengai in Livingstone managed to beat the weakened Steven Gerrard by a score of 1:0.
Ibrox hoped to score their first win away after a February triumph with a 4:1 St Johnstone score, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games in the manager's post and the latter's team is now eight points behind the away premiership leaders at Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but the Rangers, who played without inspiration, saw no chance of equalizing the score.
The Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston have risen to third and are only one goal behind the Hibernian.
And Rangers' concerns don't end there, because most likely from the stands, the butter thing hit the head to side referee Calum Spence and injured him.
Gerrard made four substitutions that allowed him to overtake Ayr and lead him to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, trusted it himself in the 11th, which took the point away from Hearts last week, and he would have liked how his well-thought-out combinations chained opponents at every step.
The Rangers dominated controlling the ball, but with it, Livingston did more.
They could have scored as early as the second minute when Menga passed the ball with a close hit towards Allan McGregor's gate for the invading Scott Pittman, but the midfielder ruined his chance by diverting the ball away from the gate.
After a distant free kick by Keaghan Jacobs, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his mate defender Alan Lithgow pleaded by.
The Rangers took control, but the last third of the game was just hope, not faith in their game.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty when he faced Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson threw his hand at the Colombian complaints.
The Rangers only managed to hit twice in the first quarter, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly frightened by Lassana Coulibaly's blow head or the gentle parody of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livy's 34th-minute goal may not have matched the course of the match, no one will argue that they deserved it already for their efforts.
The Rangers again failed to overcome Jacobs' viscous defense.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who maintained his temper and handed it to Menga for easy completion.
During the break, Gerrard took action by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and that change almost immediately bore fruit when the edge midfielder played Morelos, but after impressively playing Kelly, the runner-up repelled the blow.
Livingston put the guests in a game they loved themselves, with long-distance transfers of Lithgowo and Halkett's ball.
Holt's team was able to increase their lead at the end, but McGregor defended himself against Jacobs' blow after Lithgow filed out of the corner.
After changing into the field, Rangers player Glenn Middleton once again appealed for a penalty at the end of the match after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanac: on September 30, 1882, today it is already 136 years ago and MORE... On that day, future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity. The invention by which the device was later developed is known as Geiger's meter.
Since then, this device has become a hit in the world of science, and later a hit in popular culture, when the 1950 film Bells of Coronado was played by non-super-like scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear how the atoms are working, touched by the radioactive effects in the minerals."
Evans: "Hey, now it's really shooting!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that received his name continues to exist.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells and kill them
The vaccine has learned the immune system to recognize bad cells - this is part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
The cells can then "see" the proteins typical of many cancers and are injected back again
The pilot vaccine has yielded promising results in the treatment of patients with various cancers.
One woman who has been treated with this vaccine, which teaches her immune system to recognize bad cells, has had ovarian cancer gone away for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory, then the cells can see proteins characteristic of HER2-type cancers and are injected back again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
"HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and rectum," Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, whereby immune cells are extracted from patients and learned to target cancer cells, has been successfully applied in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West launched a short supporting tirade, wearing a MAGA cap, following his appearance on the SNL show.
Good it didn't end
After a sloppy performance on Saturday Night Live, the studio's viewers were embarrassed by the shouts of Kanye West, who praised U.S. President Donald Trump; he said he would take part in the 2020 campaign.
After performing the third song "Ghost Town" that evening, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he continued to condemn the Democrats and expressed his support for Trump.
"How many times have I had to talk to white people, they'd say, 'How can you like Trump, after all he's a racist?'
Well, if racism bothered me, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL show began with a comic scene in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual misconduct made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this was not broadcast, footage with West's replicas was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to make a mockery of West on this record.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the scenes due to his headdress.
"They mocked me behind the scenes.
He said don't go there with a hat like that.
They mocked me!
They said I had reached the bottom," he quipped at the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see what the bottom is?" he asked. "I wear my superman hat and that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to exist?
Start loving."
His utterances caused disapproval in the audience at least twice and the members of the SNL broadcast looked embarrassed, as reported by Variety. One person told the media, "A fatal silence prevailed throughout the studio."
West was invited to promptly replace singer Ariana Grande as her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West perplexed many with his performance, during which he performed the song "I Love it", wearing a Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from Candace Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who posted a post on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous people in the spirit: THANK YOU FOR AGAINST THE MINS."
But talk show host Karen Hunter posted on Twitter a record that West was just "being himself and that's amazing".
"But I choose NOT to be a person (buying his music or clothes, or supporting his 'art') whose beliefs are a toxic ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we're free too," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that his name had changed and that he was now formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first creator to change his name, but followed the same path that Diddy, also known by the names of Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy, has already passed.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was originally called Snoop Lyon; music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.

'Game of Thrones' star Next Harington criticizes distorted view of masculinity
Another Harington became famous as the sword-smoking character John Snow in HBO's fantastic adventure series about the Middle Ages "Game of Thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of the match hero. He states that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Another said that he believed "something was wrong", and raised the question of how to combat the problem of perverse masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old fellow "Game of Thrones" star, admitted that he was "strongly touched" by the subject.
"I feel that this topic touches me hard now. Where did we make the mistake of developing masculinity?" he asked.
"What do we teach growing men that we face such problems?"
Another believes that, in part, this wave of perverted masculinity could be responsible for television, as it creates highly masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate, and what is learned?
What is it that is taught on television or on the street that young people are convinced that they must have this type of masculinity?
I think that's one of the important questions of our time - how do we change that?
Obviously, we made a mistake with the young men somewhere."
He also confirmed in an interview that he would not participate in any of the "Game of Thrones" prehistory or sequels when the series ends next summer, and said that "he's already had enough battle fields and horses."
From November Another film by Sam Shepard "True West" in the modern version. It is a film about a film director and his brother a robber.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him during the production of "The Wars of Thrones," where he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife in this series, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and further life," he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played Igrite, the love object of Other's character John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 in a property owned by Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports increase in new cases of disease 14%
China reports a 14% increase in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to representatives of health authorities, more than 820,000 people have been infected with the infection in the country.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most newly infected people have had the infection transmitted sexually, and this is different from past statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV has thus dropped to almost zero , according to representatives of Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
Over time, however, the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a sensitive issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China as early as 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Because conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men end up marrying women.
Most cases of infection with the disease occur due to improper protective measures during such sexual relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as one way to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking Republican senator's data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees posted personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the pages of lawmakers at Wikipedia.
A Los Angeles Democrat said the accusations were made by ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
"A lie, a lie and once again a despicable lie," Waters said on her Twitter account.
The disclosures reportedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill at a time when allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh were pending in the Senate.
The leaked information appeared some time later when these three senators asked questions to Kavanaugh.
"Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address used to identify the source of these records associated with the Waters office and that the Waters staff member's information had been disclosed," reports from the Capitol.
"These unfounded allegations are completely false and absolute lies," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these fraudulent and false allegations is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded allegations are completely false and absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds angrily," Fleischer wrote.
"It says she doesn't have enough self-control to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of things they didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
He should not defend himself.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He should be calm and humble."
Fleischer seems to have tried to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is taking part in the midterm election campaign to replace Waters, also made his thoughts on Twitter.
"Truth, if not lies," he wrote.
In its statement, Waters said that its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false charges.
"We will ensure that the organisers are made clear," she continued, "that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees without exception."
Review of the comedy "Johnny Inglish strikes again" - exhaled parody of spies with Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any British film. The same seems to be true of the revival of the action spy comedy franchise Johnny Inglish - Johnny Inglish was launched back in 2003, and returned to the screens in 2011 with the comedy Resurrection of Johnny Inglish.
Will this sarcastic autosate about how obviously we have screwed up become a new national export opportunity?
Whatever the case, incompetent Johnny English has a second chance to bring up unpleasant truths with wide eyes and a rubber face - after all, the title itself makes it clear that this comedy work is for non-English-speaking regions of the cinematographer.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, although he has claims to luxury, has acquired some of the qualities of Inspector Clouseau, some of Mr. Bean's traits, and a slack resemblance to that guy, a reference to which was used during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics to create the theme of the drama Fire Carriages.
He is also somewhat based on the character about the traveler and the mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
This latest Johnny Inglish film has some beautiful moments.
I liked it when Johnny Inglish was approaching the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the blade rotor hit his helmet.
Atkinson's comedic talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems exhaled and strangely excessive, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible boldly insert elements of comedy as well.
The humor is as if it's intended more for children than adults, and the adventures of Johnny Inglish, which I don't like, don't seem as ingenious and peaceful as Atkinson's silent jokes playing Mr. Bean.
The most common topic at this time is that Britain has found itself in serious trouble.
The cyber-hacker successfully infiltrated Britain's ultra-secret spy web and revealed the identities of all British spies in the area, causing the agent's outrage, an overly trivial role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop in the Cup of the Prime Minister, a pompous and cornered character who is already suffering from devastating political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of the character portraying Theresa May squeezes out everything she can, but in the script, good material for that is scarce.
Wise counselors inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people among those who have retired.
This means that you will have to address Johnny Inglish himself, who is currently the school principal at some lavish institution but provides illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. There were some good jokes when Inglish offered the School of Rock-type spy academy.
The Englishman is sent back to Whitehall to discuss the emergency and there meets a longtime Bough of his own, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man associated with a submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays a high-profile girl, seems underutilized by the talent.
So Batman and Robin, able to mess up all things in Her Majesty's secret service, take action again and meet Olga Kurylenko played by the fatally beautiful Ofelia Buletova.
The prime minister is dangerously turned his head by a charismatic billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problem, namely the villainous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
Inglish and Bough begin their odyssey: Dressed as waiters, they cause a fire in a French restaurant, cause chaos on a luxury Walta yacht, and Inglish begins a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality headsets to get to know the interior of Walta's house.
All the stop squads were clearly kept up for this last series, but no matter how kind or wild it is, it's all a lot like children's television.
Pretty mediocre.
As with the other Johnny Inglish films, I couldn't get rid of the thought: isn't the British film industry capable of giving Rowan Atkinson a role that would really be worth his talent?
The Labour Party denies creating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but that would be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week but that would pay for five days.
The party reportedly wants company executives to share the savings generated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, giving their employees one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend and bring home the same salary.
The source says the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to shift the country's development in a favorable direction for workers.
The transition to a four-day week of work was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to reap the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected by the end of the year.
This won't happen overnight, but the four-day week is in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to promote the idea; the Green Party also promised in the four-day week of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this idea is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "Four-day week is not party politics and it is not considered in the party."
Shadow government spokesman John McDonnell took the opportunity at last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from "faceless dictators" and "profit hunters" in utility companies.
Such plans by the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their full share, because if they see the wrong done, the Labour government may deduct something.
He also approved plans to include employees in the company's board of directors and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10 percent of the private sector's capital to employees, allowing them to receive up to GBP 500 in annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the "60 Minutes" question as to whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote by at least a week whether to nominate him to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether the facts uncovered by the Bureau of Investigation could influence the opinions of any Republican senators in a way that they would no longer support that judge.
Scott Pelley, a correspondent for the 60 Minutes interview show that aired on Sunday, asks Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could happen that the FBI would figure out anything that would change their mind.
Senator Kennedy seems to be taking a more loose view than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Well, yeah, of course," answers J. Kennedy.
"As I said while going to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, when these charges appeared, I called him and asked, "Have you done that?"
He responded decisively, firmly, unequivocally."
Thus, Mr Graham's views would appear to be unchanged.
"I'm determined about Brett Kavanaugh, it would require really shocking accusations," he says.
"For Dr. Ford, I don't know what was there, but I know one thing: Brett categorically denies this," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of what she names can confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything new will come out."
What is the World Citizen's Festival, and has it contributed in any way to poverty reduction?
The World Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars, will take place in New York City this Saturday, with the goal of eradicating world poverty as much as possible.
For the seventh year in Central Park's Great Meadow, the World Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread the message of the event's true goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen's Festival was launched in 2012. It is a follow-up to the Global Eradication of Poverty Project, an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to purchase a paid VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a variety of tasks or actions, such as engaging in volunteering activities, sending an email to a world leader, making phone calls, or helping in some other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, are the citizens of the world successful in achieving this goal? There are 12 years left by the scheduled deadline.
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really going to convince them to demand and call for action? Maybe this is just another example of so-called cliccism, fictitious activism - people think it will really change the situation by signing an online petition or posting a post on Twitter.
According to the organisers of the World Citizen Festival, the movement has registered over 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011 to promote a wide variety of goals.
Under pressure from these actions, they say, world leaders have announced $37 billion in commitments and policies that are set to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, this group cited 390 commitments and statements prompted by the group's actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that nearly 649 million people around the world are already directly affected by the secured funds.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and executors that aims to "help children grow up and unleash their full potential". After receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from global citizens, she promised to provide Rwanda with US dollars to help solve the nutrition shortage problem in the country.
"With the support of the UK government, supporters, national governments and those like you, the citizens of the World, we can achieve that social injustices such as nutritional failure become the past," Tracey Ullman, the Nutritional Power Ambassador, told a crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
This group also indicated that after receiving 5,000 referrals calling for improved nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the "Nutrition Power" project, which will bring ongoing nutrition interventions to 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website asking "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?",
The citizens of the world answer: "This is a long and difficult road - sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because we are all stronger together."
Janet Jackson, "The Weeknd", Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the performers taking part in this year's event in New York City. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the event.
According to the Secretary of the Interior, the U.S. can use the fleet to blockade to thwart Russia's energy exports
"If necessary, Washington can use the fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets as well as Middle Eastern markets," said U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext used to explore new energy markets.
"I think Russia is interfering in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy field, just as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," Zinke said, according to the available news.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States can do this with the help of the Navy, can make sure that the seaways are open and can, if necessary, carry out a blockade, and make sure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke said this to those attending an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's methods to those used in dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are essentially the same.
"The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is to find a greater or lesser counterweight to replace fuel," he said, also calling Russia a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements appeared as part of the Trump administration's mission to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace market Russia offering European consumers a much cheaper option.
As a result, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the allegedly improper Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, the reason for Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely economic, which is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position received a hostile reaction from Germany, and it reaffirmed its determination to continue this project.
Germany's main industrial organization, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't really support third-state interference in our energy supply affairs," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for office in 2020 presidential election
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at Holjok Town Hall in Massachusetts, Mrs Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to manage our failed government, they have to go to the top office as well," she said at the town hall.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to take part in the presidential election."
During a meeting at the city hall, Warren reprimanded President Donald Trump, saying he was heading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply appalled by the way Donald Trump treats our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticizes Trump and his proposed Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter message posted on Friday, Warren says that "the FBI investigation must definitely take place before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that most voters in Warren's own state believe she should not run for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of likely Massachusetts voters say the senator should not take part in the election.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick received more support, with 38 percent supporting his eventual candidacy and 48 percent opposed.
Other names discussed for potential candidacy in 2020 for prominent Democratic Party representatives include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make a formal decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
At Donald Trump's gathering, Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic disorder
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after entering military service in September.
When a domestic violence incident occurred on Monday night, he was arrested and charged.
"I see what my son is going through, what he's dealing with when he comes back to everyday life, so I understand the other families who feel the effects of the post-traumatic disorder, and the kind of injury our soldiers are getting back with," she told those gathered at Donald Trump's gathering in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Ms Palin called his arrest a avoidable truth. She said that her son and other war veterans "are returning with a little change, they are returning with a harder heart, they are returning with doubts about whether they will get respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other soldiers have given to their country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as charges of obstructing reporting domestic violence with a gun and being drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for Vasila's police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support opposition to the new asylum seeker policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of refusing asylum to those fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and this district made amicus curiae (a court consultant) remarks in Washington to support challenging asylum seekers' policies, NBC News reports.
The applicant's full name in the process Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union launched against federal policy, is not revealed.
She says her partner "and members of his criminal gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which the U.S. receives many asylum applications as states plagued by persistent gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the Immigration Appeals Board's 2014 decision to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "despite decades of state, federal, and international laws."
"Federal law requires that decisions on asylum applications be made on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the amicus curiae commented.
In this note, lawyers also argue that policies banning immigrants from entering the country are hurting the U.S. economy, and that immigrants are more likely to do business and "provide the necessary work services."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to those fleeing domestic violence and victims of gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or certain political views," Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
The asylum provided was never intended to solve all the problems (not all serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
With the double death toll in Palu, desperate search for survivors is underway
The situation of the rest of the living is steadily deteriorating.
"The tension is very high," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, calming her feverish baby son in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"The fast keeps carrying more and more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water."
It has been observed that residents return to their destroyed homes, collect stuff that is too heavy with water, and try to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and damaged 7.5 magnitude earthquake hospitals are packed.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Harry, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, were placed outdoors at Palu Army Hospital, with the hospital patients being treated outdoors as the severe aftershocks continue.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recounts how he felt a violent earthquake in the hotel's fifth-floor room, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save others.
I think I broke through the ruins of the wall," Harry told the Associated Press, adding that he had come with his family to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife's cry for help, next is silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're healthy."
US ambassador accuses China of intimidating propaganda advertising
A week after China's official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily, praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited a supplement paid by China Daily to the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, Des Moines Register, and accused China of seeking to influence the November 6 U.S. congressional elections. China denies such a charge.
"Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the U.S. election marks a new milestone in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China," U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war, and both countries are wrestling with tariffs on each other's imports of goods.
According to Chinese and U.S. experts, China's retaliatory tariffs were aimed at exporters in Iowa and similar states who supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, the former long-term governor of Iowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural produce to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said that China was "further mocked by having started printing propaganda ads in our free press."
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese authorities took advantage of the freedom of speech and the press respected in America and ordered a paid advertising message called 'Des Moines Register,'" Branstad wrote.
"In the meantime, you won't find conflicting voices in the local Beijing press kiosk and you won't get a real picture that reflects the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's disturbing economic trajectory because the press is under the hard sole of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
Branstad also added that "one of China's most well-known newspapers has gotten away with the offer to print" his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: amid midterm elections, Kavanaugh fiasco deterred Republican voter
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with even a few counts of sexual harassment, the analyst warned that this would get a negative response in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions raised by the situation are extremely strong, and many Republicans already officially say they want to run the vote.
Such things cannot be taken back later," said Grant Reeher, a professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published in The Hill newspaper on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute calls for an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will remember it both tomorrow and November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the kzip reported to Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will flow through the edges," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst for the news site.
People say she was already strong, and they're right.
But it could further strengthen positions, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, while dislike the president, often just don't vote."
Even before Mr Ford publicly gave testimony when she detailed the allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that if Republicans confirmed the candidacy, it could cause outrage.
"This has caused great confusion for the Republican Party," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee or the final vote, it's not just about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed as a judge, it's also about how the Republicans managed this situation and how they treated Ch.B. Ford," Guy Cecil, director of Priories USA, a group that helps Democrats in the election, told the news channel.
Still, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to believe after the testimony of B. Kavanaugh and Ch. B. Ford, even though she gets a little more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or likely believe the testimony of Ch. B. Ford, while 35 percent say they fully or likely believe Mr. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was really or likely to have lied when giving testimony, and only 30 percent think the same about Ch. B. Ford.
Encouraged by Mr Flake, the FBI is currently investigating charges filed by Mr Ford and the testimony of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ms Ford sworn testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, claiming that Ms Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old when she was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party they attended while studying at Yale University in the 9th.
Web inventor plans to set up new Internet to oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the global network, is developing a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This legendary inventor's latest project, Inrupt, is a company whose work is based on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and which information they have access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was to take control of the world.
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
Solid's technology-based app allows people to create their own personal online data store, POD.
It may include lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal or work tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and which information they can access.
The company calls this personal empowerment through data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes, and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, an IBM-purchased safety platform, several programmers hired to work on this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not consult Facebook or Google for changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a Medium report released on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the durability and quality of the new Solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet with the founding of the Web Consortium at the Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential say in the debate about Internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I feel tremendous optimism about this new web era," Berners-Lee added.
Honored Bernard Vann is a clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross in World War I
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary, the only Anglican church priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Pastor Bernard Vann earned the award on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Belengliz and Lucknow.
Unfortunately, after four days the pastor was shot dead by a sniper, so he remained unaware that he had been awarded the highest level of British military award.
During the parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, the memory stone was unveiled by two grandchildren.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said the fact that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat was "wonderfully symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the Saint Kenten Canal "in a very thick fog, with a heavy flurry of guns and machine guns."
He later hurried to the firing line and "extremely gallantly" led the line forward, and then alone attacked the underarm and killed the three platoon fighters.
Lieutenant Colonel B. Vann was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that he himself will never equal, but at the same time, humility is an extremely inspiring thing."
After a parade hosted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Micheal and his brother Dr. James Vann laid a wreath.
Micheal Vann said that it was a great honor for him to attend the parade, adding: "The bravery of a true hero is shown by the support that a great many people will give."
MMA fans didn't go to bed all night to see Bellator 206 but had to cater to Pig Pepa
Imagine: You don't go to bed all night to see the packed Bellator 206, but eventually you don't get to watch the main sight.
There were 13 fights in the San Jose poster, including six on the main card and broadcast live in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, UK viewers were startled by the video "Pig Pepa" that interrupted the broadcast.
Some viewers, to put it mildly, were not impressed, as it was this struggle that did not lead to sleep until the mornings.
On Twitter, one of the fans called the replacement of the broadcast with a children's cartoon "some sick joke."
"Under government rules, at 6:00 a.m., such content was inappropriate, so it was necessary to turn on a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's chief vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Yes, Pig Pep."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that future efforts will be made to adjust schedules in line with viewers in the UK.
"When I think of repetition, it seems to me that we could probably do it," Coker said.
"But it's 6:00 a.m., Sunday, at that point, and we wouldn't be able to fix it until Sunday in our time, Monday in their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast changed, a lot of messages were exchanged, not all of which were friendly.
We tried to rectify the situation, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it's a matter of power.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do. We wanted to give more to the fans, but just failed.
It's a failed situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inadequate because of his sexual orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24th athlete claimed to have only found out in elementary school that he was not the same as everyone else.
For the first time on "Desert Island Discs" hosted by Lauren Laverne, he claimed to have taken public speaking about gay rights because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that it was less important to win the Olympic Games when he became a father.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this long-running show, retired from her job for several months due to illness.
In the first show hosted by Laverne, whose guests are asked to imagine traveling to an uninhabited island, Daley claimed to have grown up feeling inferior to everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He stated, "To this day, that sense of inferiority and otherness has been an incentive that has given me the strength to succeed."
He claimed he wanted to prove himself worthy of this, so as not to disappoint those around him when they eventually learned of his sexual orientation.
The winner of two Olympic bronze medals became a high-profile LGBT activist and, participating in this year's British Commonwealth Games, took the opportunity to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He claimed to have started talking about it publicly because he thinks he is lucky to be able to live openly without any consequences, so he would like to give others that hope as well.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with her husband, US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 was unexpected for him.
Daley married a 20-year-old senior Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to Delay, when you survive so much when you're so young - in his first Olympics he only participated in 14, and three years later his father died of cancer - it's hard to meet someone who is the same age, but who has experienced the same heights and lows .
When the couple became parents to their son Robert Ray Blacko-Daley in June, Daley's perspective, he said, changed completely.
"If you had asked last year, I would have said the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal," he said.
But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robby is my Olympic gold medal."
The son's name is the same as that of his grandfather Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Anto T. Daley, his father did not want to accept death, so one of his last questions was whether tickets for the 2012 London Olympics had already been bought, which he intended to watch while sitting in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live so long anymore that he could sit in the first row," Daley said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he was not invulnerable," Daley said.
A year later, the athlete competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew I'd been dreaming about it all my life - dancing in the water watching local spectators at the Olympic Games - there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the selection of the first song for the show, Heather Small's track "Proud", which responded to his feelings in preparation for the Olympics and still pleasantly creeps his skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 a.m. British Summer Time.
After losing his form, Mr. Mickelson spent Saturday's Ryder Cup tournament on the bench
American Phil Mickelson set a record on Sunday as he will participate in the Ryder Cup tournament for the 47th time, but he will need to greatly improve his form to avoid it becoming an unsuccessful anniversary.
Mr. Mickelson, who has already played in the competition every two years for the 12th time, was seated on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fours.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time main winner spent part of the day on the support team, and the rest improved their technique on the field in order to correct errors interfering with play.
Even at career highs without hitting extremely straight, the 48th athlete is not an ideal player on tight Le Gold National grounds, whose long stretch of rough grass is extremely unfavorable to inaccurate hits.
In addition, as if the field itself were not intimidating enough, in the ninth match to be held on Sunday, Mr. Mickelson will play against the extremely accurate British Open tournament champion Francesco Molinari, who, along with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, won all four games this week.
If Americans who are four points behind manage to start the upcoming 12 unit games well, Mr. Mickelson's match could become absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, but he probably wouldn't be able to speak otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he played today, spread through my back and with his arm hug he said he was ready to play though tomorrow," Furyk said.
He has no lack of self-confidence.
He is on the list of the most glorious athletes and has given a lot to these teams both in the past and this week.
I may not have imagined that he would play two games.
I imagined more, but it came out like this, so we decided we'd do it.
He wants to play, just like everyone."
On Sunday, Mr. Mickelson will improve Nick Fald's record and become the athlete who will play the most Ryder Cup games.
It may well mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never equaled the heights of his personal records.
Mr. Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk says his presence has also brought intangible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make fun of people and is a great guy to be in the team room with," he explained.
I think the younger players had fun with it this week too, it was good to look at it.
It brings a lot more than a game."
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjorn knows a big lead could soon go away
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead in the run-up to the last Ryder Cup unit competition can easily grow into a tough fight.
The Danish athlete made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderama, where the opposing team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans, but crossed the finish line just barely leading by a score of 141-2:131-2.
"We constantly remind ourselves that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderama, where we won, but barely," said T. Bjorn (pictured), who watched the 2018 show win with a score of 5:3 on Friday and 10:6 on Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
It's going to take all the strength tomorrow.
Go ahead and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not over.
We have the goal of trying to win this prize, so we have to pursue it consistently.
I've always said, I rely on those 12 players who are on our side, but we know perfectly well who's on the other side, the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players on the challenging field, T. Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to preempt myself by any means.
Tomorrow will be a whole different hair affair.
Tomorrow the most important will be the individual game - it's a whole different thing.
It's great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you're on the field alone, the limits of your ability to play golf are tested.
This thought needs to be instilled in the players - tomorrow you will have to squeeze everything out of yourself.
Now I'm going to have to break up with my partner, and he's going to have to squeeze everything out of himself too."
Unlike T. Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself suffered both sides of the last day's surprises because he was on the winning team in Brooklyn until Europe performed Medina's miracle and turned them into losers."
"I remember every damn word," he replied when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players in 1999 in preparation for the final day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but aim for a quick start, one you've seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration in one direction occurs, the middle matches become very tense.
Accordingly, we formed our team and released the players in a way that, for us, you know... we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas will have the task of trying to lead a counter-fight and face Rory McIlroy in the top-level match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter leading among Europeans.
"I chose these guys precisely in this order because I think they will successfully beat the whole game," Bjorn said of his choice for the unit matches.
Delivery of new German naval vessel delayed again
The latest German Navy frigate was due to start work as early as 2014 and replace the Cold War-era warships, but according to the local press, it will not be seen until at least next year due to increasingly perishable systems and extremely high prices.
According to an army spokesman quoted by the Die Zeit newspaper, the commissioning of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been delayed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was marred by problems that had taken the ship already delivered.
Four Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy as early as 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are believed to be equipped with a powerful gun, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and certain stealth technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic footprint.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance intervals, which would allow the latest frigates to sail away from home ports for as long as two years.
Still, according to Die Zeit, due to endless delays, the most advanced technology ships, which are said to allow Germany to divert military power to overseas territories, will become obsolete before they are put into service.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship already delivered to the builder.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German press mentions several fundamental defects in the software and hardware that would have made the ship useless on a military mission.
Disadvantages of the software are particularly important, as the Baden-Wurttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen, a force halved from that of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that this ship is severely too heavy, which reduces its efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to introduce various improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is estimated to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project - alongside the perishable hardware including crew training - is also slowly becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from an initial sum of 2.2 billion euros to a staggering 3.1 billion (3.6 billion dollars).
The latest problems afflicting the frigate became particularly significant after recent warnings that German naval power was waning.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the navy was in fact "taking on a shortage of usable ships".
The officer said that problems had compounded over time, as the old ships had already been written off, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wurttemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
The new study, conducted at a Scottish highland estate, aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will observe asses dwarves, sopranos, brown earls and water mice in the gardens of Wester Ross Inverev in their study.
Special recorders will be arranged in certain areas of the area to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
National Health Service personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of all audio recordings will determine the frequency of signals emitted by bats and the activity of one or another type.
A map of habitable habitats and a report will then be created to help shape a detailed picture of behaviour on a landscape-wide scale.
Rob Dewar, Conservation Advisor for the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), hopes the results will reveal which habitat is most important to bats and how each species uses it.
This information will help determine the benefits of residential habitat maintenance such as grassland creation, as well as finding out how best to care for woodland to make it suitable for bats and other related species.
In the last century, bat populations have declined in Scotland and across the UK.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development work affecting hatcheries and destroying residential areas.
Wind farms and lightning are also a threat, as are flycatchers, some of the chemicals used in the treatment of building materials, as well as hunting domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, catching prey during night hunting is more aided by the ears than the eyes.
Bats pinpoint the location of insects or obstacles in the flight path by an elaborate echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, looks extremely responsibly at bats.
There are ten trained experts who conduct surveys, hatchery inspections and sometimes rescue operations on a regular basis .
The organization even created the first and only reserve specifically for bats in Scotland in Damfries and the Threeve Manor in Galloway, where eight out of ten species of Scottish bats live.
Manor keeper David Thompson says the estate area is ideal for them.
"We have a great place at Threeve Manor for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and great areas to live in.
But we don't know much about bats yet, so working here and in other places will help you better understand what they need in order to thrive."
He stresses that it is crucial to check for bats before starting maintenance work on the site, as inadvertent destruction of one hatchery could kill up to 400 females and young, which could lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected and are prohibited from being killed, teased or disturbed, and their hatchery is also prohibited from being destroyed.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, urged the public to contribute to the rescue of the bats.
She stated, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't even know how many indigenous species are doing."
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges - lawyers set to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "false" and said that people using his name "seek to become famous".
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which printed the charges.
The forward of the Portuguese and Juventus clubs is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he then allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep the event quiet.
Speaking to 142 million followers on live-streamed Instagram video hours after reports of the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo criticized the reports and called them "false".
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is falsehoods," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said as he looked at the camera.
Using my name, they want to become famous.
This is normal.
They want to be famous, to say my name is part of my job.
I'm a happy person, all right," the athlete added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel on charges they called "unacceptable publicity for allegations of private space happenings."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the athlete would seek compensation for "moral damage, the amount of which would match the significance of this violation, perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal law in the last few years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino and Hotel Apartments in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed with the Nevada Clark County Court, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room where he allegedly raped her anally.
Mayorga says that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her he was a "99 percent good man" betrayed by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo admitted that the couple had sex, but claimed they were contractual.
Mayorga also says she contacted police and her injuries at the hospital were photographed, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearing retaliation" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel the agreement as she continues to feel traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo had been bepereining from Manchester United for Real Madrid, and this summer, after signing a €100 million contract, he joined Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: The UK would forever regret losing car manufacturers
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" losing its global automotive leadership status after Brexit.
He added that he was concerned about a statement by Toyota's UK division to the BBC that, with Britain leaving the EU without a deal, production at the Burnastone factory near Derby would be temporarily suspended.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that a no-deal delay at the border would mean job losses.
The Burnastone plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, production will have to stop at our factory," Toyota CEO Burnastone Marvin Cooke said.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, have also voiced concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and its implications for international trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
According to automakers, the threats to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit are the most troubling.
Toyota's production line works when needed, as custom-made cars are brought in parts from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a contract on March 29, there may be disruptions at the border; according to the industry's companies, this could result in delays or shortages in delivery of the details.
Toyota said it would not be able to hold more than one day's supplies at the Derbyshire plant, so production would stop.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan, which envisages future relations with the EU, is "prepared specifically to avoid such border checks."
"We need a contract. We want to have the best contract that, as I say, would allow not only to enjoy success today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told the BBC's Radio 4 programme Today.
"In addition to Toyota, data from other car manufacturers show the need for continued access to a very successful supply chain system."
Toyota could not say for how long production would be halted, but warned that looking at the long term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and finally cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnastone's factory for 24 years and is responsible for Unite's trade union meetings, said that members of his trade union are increasingly worried: "I say from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never return."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
"As the fight for a Supreme Court justices candidate continues, Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week," the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the latter investigating Russian interference in the election, Trump's aides' ties with Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would dismiss the deputy attorney general, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Still, as news of his resignation flickered, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein. The meeting was later postponed to not coincide with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, testified.
On Friday, Trump told the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's accusations within a week, thus delaying the vote again in the plenary session of the Senate.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on the Fox news show on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied, "His date is not set. It may happen this week, but given all the events related to the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to tell the press the news."
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: as of September 10, Sanders had not held a single White House press conference.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that press conferences are rarely held not because he dislikes TV journalists who "seek effects for viewers." True, he added: "I have to accept the fact that they seek effects for viewers."
He then hinted that Trump would communicate directly with the press more often.
"The president answers questions more often than any previous president," she said, adding without providing any evidence: "We reviewed these statistics."
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it's significantly better than talking to me.
We've often tried to do this and you've seen it happen many times in the last few weeks. the press conferences will be replaced by your direct communication with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honorable guests.
One-person press conferences are rare.
The president's free and sometimes bizarre appearance against journalists this week in New York must have explained why.
Health Minister wrote to Scottish NST staff from the EU over Brexit concerns
Health Minister for Scottish NST staff from the EU wrote a letter expressing the country's gratitude and desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent the letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applications for settled status for EU citizens working in the public service sector assigned to it.
In a letter, Mr Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU for a withdrawal have continued and are coming close to the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK Government began to accelerate preparations for a possible no-deal scenario as well.
I know you're all very worried now.
That's why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of all the staff, no matter what their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experiences and skills that enhance and improve the work of the healthcare system, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie, who suffered a head injury, underwent emergency surgery
On Saturday, Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery during a 31:27 defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores team in a head injury to Tennessee State Tigers defender, Tennessee journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came up to the sideline and he just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medics at the sideline Abercrombie gave oxygen to breathe, then laid it on the stretcher and sent it for further research.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris of Nashville, Tennessee, told WSMV that Abercrombie's surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center had been completed.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type and extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it happened.
Officially spending the sports season, second-rater Abercrombie moved from Illinois and plays the first season on the Tennessee State team.
Before leaving the game, he rebounded five balls on Saturday, and his total number of rebounds over the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay higher stamp duty
Under the new Tory plans, foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay a higher stamp tax, and the additional money received will be used to help the homeless
This move will reduce the risk of a successful campaign by Corbyn to attract young voters
The increased stamp duty will be levied on non-UK tax-payers
The Ministry of Finance expects to be able to raise up to GBP 120 million a year in this way, and will provide them to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers buying UK real estate are going to be charged a higher rate stamp tax and use the extra money received to help the homeless
By promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people, the move is expected to reduce the risks posed by Jeremy Corbyn's successful campaign to attract young voters.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on non-UK tax payers and businesses, and the additional money received will be used to promote the Government's anti-homelessness campaign.
An additional toll - paid alongside the current stamp tax, including higher rates introduced two years ago for buying second homes or homes for rent - can reach as much as three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this move will allow the collection of up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built real estate is bought by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it more difficult for first-time home buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, making numerous rich areas of the country and especially the capital a ghost town.
The new strategy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people purchase their first home.
He accused large construction companies of quickly buying up land but not using it, they support high property prices, and called on May to address Britain's housing shame by abandoning affordable house quotas.
Corbyn has announced several eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including rent control and a no-fault ban.
In addition, he wants to give more power to build new houses to municipal councils.
May said: "Last year, I said that as prime minister, I would seek to return the British dream - for every new generation, life has to be better.
Which means we need to fix our dysfunctional housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is not right that UK non-residents and foreign-based businesses can buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of housing has become almost unfulfillable, and the threat of humiliation of homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland CEO Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's national team manager sometime.
The 42-year-old Scottish likes the challenge of revitalizing the North-East club, currently in third place in the first league and three points behind the first-placed club.
After taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season, he moved to Stadium of Light this summer.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got into the B team and it was over," Ross told the BBC programme Scotland's Sportsound.
"But as a child I grew up in Hamden Stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish national team matches, and that always attracted me back.
It is true that this opportunity will only come if I lead the club successfully."
Prior to Ross, Sunderland was led by Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy-us Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, the former head of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel anxious about starting to work after such well-known executives at such a large club.
"My success will now be judged by the answer to the question 'Can I return this club to the Premier League?'
According to the structure and conditions, this club is definitely part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to take him there. But it's probably only after returning the club to the league that I think I've worked here successfully."
Ross's leadership career only lasted three years. Prior to that, he worked as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and replaced the Hearts coaches for 15 months.
He later helped recover from Alloa, who had fallen to the third division, and turned St Mirren's club, which was in danger of falling, into the championship winners the following season.
Ross says he is now more satisfied than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"This change was probably radical," he recalls of leading Alloa.
"I honestly believed that it was right for me to lead, it was more appropriate than to play.
It sounds strange, because I was successful, I earned a lot and I was happy with the satisfactory achievements.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of problems to overcome each week.
And it's not easy right now - working stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I've always wanted to lead, and I'm doing it now. As an adult, I've always felt like I was in my sled, but leadership is the most rewarding."
You can hear the entire interview during the Sportsound programme on Sunday, 30 September, on Radio Scotland from 12.00 to 13.00 English Summer Time
Studies have found that the best time for pints of beer is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat surge increased the income of the needy British pubs, but made the burden on restaurant chains even more difficult.
The figures revealed that sales of pubs and bar groups rose 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, the business consulting firm that produced this data, said: "The endless sunbathing and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup meant that similar trends continued in July as in June, when beer revenues grew by 2.8 percent.
In June, sales in restaurants declined by 1.8 percent, and in July, the situation became even worse.
The results of the breweries and bars that receive the main income from the liquor trade were undoubtedly the best, and the trade in them grew more strongly than the decline in restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant companies, the main food-producing breweries were also affected in the sunbathing.
People seem to want to just go out for a drink.
In well-groomed pubs and pubs, liquor sales rose 6.6 percent this month, and food sales fell 3 percent."
Paul Newman of RSM, an analysis firm in the leisure and hospitality sector, says: "These results continue the trend seen since the end of April.
For caterers, weather and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be key factors.
So it's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle. True, the drop in sales of 4.8 percent for a number of years will be especially painful, as it will contribute to the unsettled cost-related pressure.
For businesses with the most income from food trade, a long hot summer could not come at a worse time. Time will tell whether the milder temperatures felt in August will provide the much needed respite."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened locations, in July was 2.7 percent and reflected a slowdown in the development of brand-owned networks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales monitoring tool for the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the UK and recognised by its guidelines, collects and analyses operating data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One in five children have social media accounts hidden from their parents
The study revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 years old - have social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake Insta pages was increasing
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they have a parent-in-residence basic account
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta pages, a link to photo sharing website Instagram.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they use a censored main account for parents to display, but also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret website for her 13-year-old daughter, found out that the teenage girl was insisting on "rape me".
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors Conference (MDK) found that 40 percent of students aged 11-18 have two accounts, and half of those students admitted to hiding accounts.
MDK executive Mike Buchanan said, "The fact that so many teenagers succumb to the temptation to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers can't find them is alarming."
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Sports Council
At the general annual meeting of the Scottish Sports Council's governing body, Eilidha Doyle was elected its director as a consultant.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning lightweight athlete and chairwoman. Ian Beattie has described this move as a great opportunity that allows people in charge of sports to benefit from the diverse international experience she has gained over the past decade.
"Eilidha has earned great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world sports community and we have no doubt that her inclusion in the council will bring many benefits to Scottish sport," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I really want to serve as the voice of the athletes and I hope that I will really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The 200- and 400-meter event at the 1996 Atlanta Games and the total of four Olympic gold medals won by an American now appearing as a permanent BBC expert were unable to walk after suffering a short-term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time would tell if and to what extent I would recover.
I had to work until exhaustion, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and I'm doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!"
Breastmilk advertising, which compares mothers to cows, has received different reviews on the Internet
The firm that makes breast milkbrushes has received different opinions about its advertising, which compares nursing mothers to dairy cows.
To mark the beginning of the trade of the product, described as the world's first silent portable breast enlargement, consumer technology company Elvie has released an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video. It aims to showcase the freedom that the new milktrapper provides to nursing mothers.
In a hay-filled cowhide, four true mothers dance to a sound recording in which one hears, for example, the following words: "Yes, I'm lying to myself, but no tail can be seen" and "If you haven't noticed, here's not the udders, here's my breasts."
The appendix continues, "Get him out, get him out, feed the babies with him, get him out, get him out, lie to my beauties."
However, the advert posted on the company's Facebook page sparked an online controversy.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and received several hundred comments, has been responded to by viewers in a variety of ways. Many have claimed that it overlooks the horrors of the dairy industry.
"To promote this product using cows is a very poor solution.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, only after their newborns are born they are taken away from them a few days later," one woman wrote.
The "Elvie" breast milkstring fits imperceptibly in the feeding bra ("Elvie" / "Mother")
Another commented: "It's understandable that it traumatizes both the mother and the newborn.
But why not use them for an advertisement presenting a breast milktrab for mothers from whom babies are not taken away?"
Someone else added, "Advertising is a complete misunderstanding."
Another commentator defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that she found the song "very fun".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I would buy it if I were still feeding.
When I stopped milk, I felt just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant," wrote one.
Another commented: "This fun advertisement is for mothers who take their milk off (often at work or toilets) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all danced with inconspicuous breaststrokes installed in their bras.
The campaign's idea is based on the insight that many breast milk interrupters claim to feel like cows.
Still, the Elvie milkspring makes no sound, has no wires or tubes, and fits imperceptibly in the feeding bra, allowing women to move freely, keep babies, or even leave the house as they pull off their milk.
Mother's partner and executive creative director Ana Balarin commented: The Elvie milktrapper is a revolutionary product that deserves to be launched boldly and provocatively.
Comparing the feeding women to the dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the cessation of milk and all the challenges it presents, while having fun and showing as much as possible the incredible sense of freedom that the new milktrain will bring.
Elvie's milkball didn't make it to the press headlines for the first time.
During London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski's collection of two children was shown on a podium by a mother using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border has not changed substantially over the month, but the number of migrant children detained has increased significantly, in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it more difficult to accommodate them with caregivers.
Traditionally, most patrons were immigrants themselves without papers and feared that applying for child custody risked the possibility of staying in the country.
After the federal government announced in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and this data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk increased further.
Last week, Chief Executive of the Immigration and Customs Service, Matthew Albance, testified to Congress that the institution had detained several dozen people who had applied for adult unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been tried before.
"Nearly 80 percent of these individuals, whether guardians or members of their family, live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to pursue these individuals," Albence said.
According to the shelter staff, in order to consider cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules. According to them, some children must appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than within 60 days as was customary earlier.
Many will try to defend the application for legal status against a judge on immigration issues not by coming in person, but by making a conference video call.
Those who are not eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
According to shelter staff and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Defenders say this is even more worrying in large institutions such as the Tornil Shelter: the size in them increases the chance of noticing signs that the child is suffering.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma many have already suffered.
Syria told U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In addition, in an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees home, although the war has been going on in the country for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces under the guise of counter-terrorism are illegal on Syrian soil and will be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem asserted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people had died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, the war on terror was almost over.
He said that Damascus would not stop fighting this holy struggle until we eradicate both terrorist groups and any illegal foreigners in all Syrian territories.
There are approximately 2,000 United States troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were good, and at the same time accused some Western countries of spreading an unreasonable fear that discourages refugees from returning.
"We appealed to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return," he said.
"They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would only receive reconstruction aid once Assad and the opposition reached a political agreement and ended the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement allowed to avoid a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces targeting a province with a population of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement provided clear deadlines, and also expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including militants from the Nusra-linked Nusra Front, which would be destroyed.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy, hopes to convene the first meetings of a committee composed of members of the Government and opposition soon to draft the Syrian post-war constitution and prepare the soil for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions under which the Syrian government would participate in the committee - the group's work must be limited to revising the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why will Trump be elected for a second term?
Based on this logic, Trump would be elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, his presidency was prematurely ended by impeachment and scandal.
Without a doubt, this would be the most dramatic end to the presidency ever!
No signs of spectator fatigue have yet been seen.
Since 2014, the best broadcast time ratings on CNN TV have increased more than twice to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has grown almost three times to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of the best broadcast time, a number that grew from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show ranks first in cable television rankings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
"It's a fire that draws people because we don't understand something," says Neal Baer, who produces the ABC series Descedent about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the House of Congress.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Only Fun Parts and a Few Unpleasant Truths on How to Secretly Enter a Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a trip in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'He makes me laugh,'" Scovell said.
Chaos is valuable in that it amuses.
Of course, in contrast to other TV shows, plots coming from Washington may determine the future of the case Roe v. Wade, the possibility of uniting immigrant families, and the state of the global economy.
Non-watching is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it's more than necessary to be an informed citizen when you realize that you've been watching for six hours as a group of experts debate how Bob Woodward uses sensitive data for his book Fear, Paul Manafort demonstrates a $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("thoroughly conceited clothing," wrote The Washington Post), and what it means to be a shocking description of Trump's ostrich.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"His actions are reminiscent of a reality show because he throws something at you every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing characters of the Trump show and the daily vicissitudes of the storyline (involved in conflict with N.F.L. or praise for Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a single series, otherwise you'll fall behind.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, there was 27 degrees of heat outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai and the sun shone, but he was tingling inside and watching MSNBC while recording for CNN.
He couldn't tear himself away - certainly not when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on his hair.
"I remember when we once made those crazy shows, people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

In a tense midterm election fight for the House of Representatives is pouring money from around
It's no wonder that the reshuffle of congressional districts, which resulted in the two members of the House of Representatives trying to win the same post, inundated Pennsylvania's 17th district with money.
The recently redrawn suburban Pittsburgh County put Democrat House of Representatives member Conora Lamba in the fight, winning his seat last spring in a special election in another county.
Lamb competes with another member of the House of Representatives, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing Pennsylvania's previous District 12. Much of it overlaps with the new 17th.
Maps were redrawed when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that in violation of the constitution the old districts were falsified in favor of Republicans.
During the election fight in the new 17th district, the financial institutions of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DKKK) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRKK), were in a fight over campaign finance.
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania when he won the widely-watched March special election by a small margin in the 18th congressional district.
Republicans held the seat for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won by 20 points in the county.
Political experts gave the Democrats some advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then calmed down
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, but have not received a negative reaction from Washington in principle.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and, until the partners moved out of Trump Organization leadership, had a hotel in this country.
"Recent decisions have led to the removal of Taiwan State Department officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to recall the heads of American diplomatic missions," department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions are only being considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, as well as drug control, development, and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions for specific individuals, would have been painful for a Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as an important step forward to prevent migrants heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and thus effectively ended any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
"In order to demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to this gathering, Vice President Mike Pence is now on the list of speakers for the conference planned for mid-October," diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without reporting any reprimands or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment to Bolton on the details of the discussion, which were told by three American officials, including two diplomats. They agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are corroborated by an outsider analyst close to the administration who also spoke if his anonymity is preserved.

Next, it is inevitably possible to wait for a special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, a very strong piece of evidence now available in public archives.
In addition, Mueller is reportedly turning his investigation to the question of whether Trump's campaign was not conducted in collusion with Russia, which was hurting our elections.
If Congress were to move into other hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution, at the same time as he is about to stand up again to the electorate, and possibly finally to the commission of officials.
There's a lot of "if" here, and I'm not claiming that Trump's end is inevitable - as are his European equivalents.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic will need to make choices, and these choices will determine whether the fight will last long.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler - it was only necessary for the West to oppose him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We screwed up and missed an opportunity to prevent a massacre that lasted several years later.
The story revolves around such points of crucial turning point - then the unquenchable march of democracy is accelerated or paused.
Americans now found themselves at a few points of such crucial turning points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mueller's investigation's fate depends?
Rosenstein's troubles began when this newspaper reported that an official had offered to secretly record the president last year and had considered his unfitness to hold office.
Rosenstein argues that The Times' narrative is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh proves to be incomplete or incorrect or if, despite convincing accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony, this candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And, finally, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections that will force Trump to take responsibility?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy is threatened by a long winter.
But because of the lesson I've learned in Prague, I believe we'll keep them.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime once housed in a home where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and after 60 years sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with swastika.
When I have such a legacy, how can I view our future in a non-optimistic way?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers clash with Rapid Vienna awaits optimistically
On Thursday, Rangers will accept Rapid Vienna knowing that if they win a spectacular match against the Austrians in Spain earlier this month, they could find themselves in a strong position to leave Group G.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was only able to appear for the first time this season in a 2:2 score-ending competition with Villarreal. But he hopes the Rangers club can use this score as a springboard towards more important goals.
"We had a good result because Villarreal is a great team," the 31-year-old player said.
"We started playing with the belief that we would achieve something, and we ended up achieving something.
We might have been more accurate at the end, but overall the competition was not bad.
They probably played better in the first quarter, and we dragged on in the second and turned out to be a better team.
There will be another significant European League night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be tough, because in the latter competition their result was great. But I have no doubt that with the support of the audience we can step forward and achieve a good result.
Last year was a tough year, both what happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a good mood there.
The team is good and the guys are really excited; the training is great.
I hope we can now step forward, forget last season and play successfully."
Because of this fear of retirement savings, a woman suffers from insomnia
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of what care they would like to receive, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not trying to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance firm.
That's where you need to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not inform your wishes in advance, you will not prepare your family to take care of you.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and what care you would like to receive, as these factors may be important to predict costs.
Call a financial advisor. The advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay these costs.
Long-term care can decide to pay these costs by helping with a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a mixed money-value life insurance policy, or by hedging your assets as long as you have the money.
Prepare legal documents: Prevent legal disputes by protecting yourself with permitting documents.
Prepare a power of attorney for health care: Designate a trusted person to take care of your medical care and ensure that professionals will heed your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think of a mandate to take care of your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Remember the details: Imagine your elderly father or mother needing emergency medical attention and taking him or her to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
To be ready, list these details in the plan.
"It's not just financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Plan that too."
Man shot multiple times in Ilfrakume by air rifle
After spending an evening in the city, a man who was walking home was shot several times with an air rifle.
The 40-year-old victim was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm by Ilfracum in the Grauv district of Oxford, Devon.
At around 02:30 a.m., the shooting was described by officials as a random act.
The victim did not see the attacker.
Injuries do not threaten his life, and police are asking witnesses for help.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
"At least 384 were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday," officials said.
Due to the destroyed communications emergency services officials were unable to obtain any data from Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu located nearby from the 7.5 magnitude earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu in the aftermath of the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi.
Palu, which had a population of about 379,800 in 2017, is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, established at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the quake struck and a tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency stretching along the coast of more than 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, for the province in a smaller administrative region, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic pillars of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Mining of nickel is also important in the province, however, mainly concentrated in Morovali on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past century.
In 1938, a tsunami in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, a tsunami struck western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia, on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a strong quake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several strong quakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias near it.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 quake struck the southern part of Indonesia's most densely populated island Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
A magnitude 7.6 quake in 2009 struck the area near the western capital of Sumatra province, Padang.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
In 2010, a magnitude 7.5 quake struck one near the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves reaching up to 10 meters, sweeping dozens of villages and killing approximately 300 people.
In 2016, a minor earthquake in Aceh caused the Pidiya Jaya regency to be devastated and panicked as people remembered how things had been devastated by the terrible 2004 quake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but the collapsing buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong quakes struck the Indonesian tourist-rich island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily stranded on the coast.
Saraha Palin's eldest son detained on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Saraha Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska Police, Palin, a 29-year-old from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and detention resistance.
According to a police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took the phone away from her.
As reported by KTUU, Palin was returned to Mat-Su's pre-trial detention facility for custody and released on $500 bail.
"On Saturday, he appeared in court, where, when asked to make an excuse, he claimed to be completely innocent," the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, meaning he could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with Class B misconduct, punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged assault.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
The incident is linked to charges of assault at home, obstruction of reporting a domestic violence crime, and possession of a gun while intoxicated in January 2016.
His girlfriend stated that he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups when she linked her son's brutal behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working. the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Social media shares videos showing the moment of a tsunami strike.
The tsunami hit the coast when hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for New York terrorist attack suspect
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is suspected that on October 31, 30-year-old Saipov leased a truck from Home Depot and carried out an attack on a bike path along the western highway in Lower Manhattan - driving down the trail, laying out pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report in southern New York County announcing the intention to seek the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these indictments can lead to the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury of the affidavits released a 22-point indictment covering eight counts of murder related to extortion (usually applied by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases), and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say the attack was very well planned and premeditated, and the way Saipov carried it out called disgusting, cruel and immoral.
"As a result of the actions of Sayfull Habibullaevicius Saipov, members and friends of the following families were injured, hurt and lost to their loved ones: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijo, Hernano Ferruchio, Hernano Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case that required the death penalty was heard in New York's Southern District a decade ago.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time he was executed was in 1953, in a New York federal case against spouses Julius and Ethele Rosenbergs, when they were convicted two years ago of plotting to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not regret his act either immediately after the attack or a few months later.
According to police, he told investigators he was feeling good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired to commit the attack by Islamic State (ISIS) videos he was watching on his phone.
Police reported that he also asked for the flag of the Islamic State to be hung in the hospital ward.
He did not plead guilty under the 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal state-funded defenders representing Saipov, said they were visibly disappointed by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than admit guilt and life imprisonment without the possibility of being released will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARRAGE must be responsible for Brexit talks
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the nation's army during a protest at a Tory conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must feel the heat of Eurosceptics, and one of Theresa May's party MPs suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative House of Commons, told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have already left if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the difficulties that May faces in trying to unify the divided ranks of supporters were revealed by the Tories in favour of staying in the EU, who joined the city's separate anti-Brexit protest.
The prime minister finds it difficult to carry out her Chequers-agreed compromise plan when it is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostile reaction and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone said at a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihal that he wanted to disrupt Chequers' plan.
He argued that Farage should have been an equal partner and should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had led, we would have already left the EU," he said.
Velingboro MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to obey others.
We want to pass our own laws in our country."
"Bone has denied hints that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The notion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is absolutely untrue.'"
Brexit supporter Tory Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstrations and told reporters, "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, hear the people.
Chequers' plan is unpopular among the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it. it is also unpopular among our party members and activists who are taking to the streets and, above all, voting for us.
Give up Chequers' plan and start listening."
In a critical statement, May added: "The Prime Ministers retain their posts when they keep their promises."
Farage said rallying politicians must be made to feel the heat if they issue a 2016 referendum decision.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the nation and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, so we're here today to tell them we won't let you get away with doing it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which has almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing an army of this nation that has brought us a Brexit victory, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud of the United Kingdom."
And Brexit opponents marched the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
When the group formed this weekend, a group of activists waved banners saying "Tories against Brexit".
Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security concerns they had suffered as a result of the party app's start to the conference.
"These are the people who say they can implement the IT systems and all the technology needed for the Canada plus plus option, for frictionless borders and for free trade without borders with Ireland," he said.
"This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider taking part in presidential elections
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider taking part in the presidential election after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with the public in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticizes President Donald Trump, is running in a November runoff election to face GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, one of the leaders of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that she may have clashed with Trump in 2020.
Since Trump became president, Saturday afternoon's event in Holjok has been her 36th meeting with voters using a public meeting format.
One participant asked if she planned to participate in the presidential election.
Warren replied that the time had come for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, and that women had to be in charge.
Suspect arrested in LSU Sims shooting case
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported Saturday that they had detained a suspect accused of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At a press conference at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been detained.
Police released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the man seen in it.
20-year-old Sims was shot and died near the University of the South campus early Friday.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday that Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result of his injuries.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to having been at the crime scene, had a gun, and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained unopposed and was placed under arrest by the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
Sims, a student of the 198 cm tall penultimate course, grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the previous season, 10 of which started in the starting five, spent an average of 17.4 minutes per game on the pitch, scored 5.6 points each, and rebounded 2.9 balls each.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton came close to World Champion title when the team instructed him to give victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteris Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton on Saturday in a qualifying drive, it immediately became clear that Mercedes' team instructions in the race would be crucial.
Starting the race from the first place, Bott started well and, defending his position in the first two turns, nearly left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to make his way into the two-rift garage, left Hamilton, and he returned to the race in the group's tail, so it was fatal.
Mercedes stopped in a two-barreled garage under the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after barely contacting the action, when the Ferrari driver reluctantly loosened the inner side of the track after a double manoeuvre to preserve the position in the third turn.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the end of the lineup, but was already driving seventh at the end of the first lap.
He was the fastest for most of the race, as he drove without changing tires to be as fast as possible in the finish, ahead of Kimi Raikkonen and finishing fourth.
At last, in lap 44, he stopped in a two-rift garage, but failed to increase pace in the remaining eight laps and Raikkonen crossed the finish line fourth.
"Valtter had a tough day because he was doing great all weekend, and when he was asked to miss me he acted like a real gentleman.
The team did a great job and won two first places," Hamilton said.
It was really poor body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a meeting with people on Saturday for insisting she denied leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh is accused of sexual assault.
In a speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly name Ford's testimony to the Senate Legal Committee, but said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were wicked, obscene, and unjust.
"What could have happened and is actually happening in recent days in the Senate when you see anger when you see people are angry, wicked, obscene and wrong," he said.
"When you see official statements and leaks, and then you say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer to the question, did you leak the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Certainly not.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added, portraying the senator.
As early as July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh and which had been leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee, "I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations and leaked her story."
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked."
However, he appeared to disagree with her denial, saying during a meeting with people on Saturday night: "You know, it was really bad body language.
It may not have leaked, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend a candidate for Supreme Court justices who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats used the accusations to their advantage.
"They are determined to regain power by whatever means they can.
You see rascality, indecency; they don't care what they hurt or what they have to drive through to get power and control," the president's speech to Mediaite was quoted as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in a game with the Dandi club Giants
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League defeat by the Belfast Giants and won Saturday's retaliatory game with a Dandi score of 5:3.
The Giants advanced early when two goals were scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie had equalled the score before Dwyer took the Giants forward again.
Francois Bouchard of the Dandi team leveled the score, but two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen later secured victory.
Adam Keefe's men suffered a third defeat this season in the Elite League, before catching up on Friday night in Belfast and defeating Dandi's club by a score of 2:1.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, with the Giants winning the three previous games.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendall McFaull's transfer, and four more minutes later, Beauvillier doubled the lead after David Rutherford's transfer.
In a difficult start to the game, Sullivan returned the arena hosts to the game scoring a goal at 13:10, and after Matt Marquardt's transfer, Cownie equalized the score at 15:16.
Dwyer arranged for the Giants to go out on their first break in the lead, and scored their second goal of the evening at the end of the first quarter.
With a quantitative lead, the hosts of the square regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the score at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen advance in the first game for the Dandi team at the end of the second quarter, and solidified the victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, will meet Milton Keynes' team at home next Friday.
Air traffic controller killed to help hundreds of plane passengers escape earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller was declared a hero when he was killed helping an aircraft with several hundred passengers safely take to the air.
More than 800 people were killed and numerous are presumed missing after a strong earthquake rocked Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to shake the site and numerous people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily fluctuating control tower at the Sis Al-Jufri Airport in the city of Palu.
He remained at his place of work to help the 6321 flight-bound Batik Air aircraft, which was already on the runway at the time, take off safely.
Then thinking that the air traffic control tower was collapsing, he jumped out of it.
He later died in hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We flew him by helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It's an immensely painful message for us," he added.
And authorities fear that the death toll could rise to thousands as the country's disaster relief agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Sigis and Boutong are hard to reach.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as many victims are still under the rubble and we cannot reach them," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six metres high have devastated the city of Palu; it will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute, ambulances bring in those affected.
There is a lack of clean water.
Self-service shops are being robbed everywhere ."
Janis Gelfand, head of the International Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse."
Indonesian President Jok Widod arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was rocked by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
Airlines operating the flight, which ended in a plane crash in the Micronesian-owned Pacific lagoon, now say one person is missing, although they have previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they had no news of a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airlines indicated that they were cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their search for her husband.
Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for more information about a passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses to the incident believe that the plane failed to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from very low.
"It was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to get to emergency exits on a sinking plane and to the waist inundated.
He said the flight attendants were panicked and shouted while he himself sustained a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that their sailors who repaired the pier nearby also helped rescue people who were transported ashore by an inflatable boat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in accidents involving airliners registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none belonged to Air Niugini.
Analyst laid out sequence of events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office laid out the facts available in a retrial on Saturday of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone records to bring together the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that indicated Tellis was with Chamber on the night of her death, contradicting previous statements.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with friend Michael Sanford, police went to interview Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telley was telling the truth, stating that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying because his truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Telly claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records show that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death Teller had deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin teaching its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would be handed over to the jurors later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative attitude to this genre by spreading positive messages with their music.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from the roots of political messages and points to social problems.
They want to get back to the origins of hip hop and promote conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently been reborn in the UK in the works of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York babysitter sued the couple after being fired due to a "racist" message
A New York nanny sued the couple for dismissal on grounds of discrimination after receiving a false-addressed message from her mother complaining that she was "another black woman".
The couple denies being racist and called the lawsuit "rape".
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was upset to learn that new child caretaker Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEE, DAR ONE BLACK," Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, she was not sent to her husband twice, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing he had acted recklessly, Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and fired Mr. Maurice, claiming that the previous nanny, who was African-American, had done her job badly and was expecting a Filipino woman instead.
Mr. Maurice was paid for one working day and she was sent home by Uber by car.
Maurice has now sued the couple for compensation for the dismissal and seeks to sue for as much as $350 a day for a half-year life and work at the client's home, for which she was initially hired albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that things like this cannot be done," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple rebuffed the accusations of racism by denying this and claimed that sacking Maurice was reasonable because they feared they would not be able to trust her, after insulting her.
"My wife sent her what she didn't want to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasc told Post.
"Would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Plasc, who likened the lawsuit to "rape", said his wife had had a baby just two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to judge for it?
It's not a very nice behavior," added an investment banking specialist.
While the court case was pending, the media rushed to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared readers would not understand a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to feel like someone else is reading the book for the first time before it's published.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's tremendous success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before discovering the inspiration to write a book for children about a plush teddy bear, would not have been too upset if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release after his father's death a year later was pleasant and at the same time sad.
Referring to Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet person and he didn't like to brag," she said.
"Because Paddington was so similar to himself, he felt like he had a child who achieved something: you're proud of him, even though it's not really your job.
I think he was similarly appreciative of Paddington's success story.
Although it was his work and the fruit of his imagination, he always devoted his merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors never managed to save her life.
"Nad kept calling and said that the condition was really bad, she was not expected to survive," said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nado who called to say she had two minutes left to live and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I said to her, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given by the doctors that supported her heartbeat slowly ended up working and removed from the body.
She died a little ahead of time and that was the end of everything.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn't howl, scream, or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it in myself."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning his dead daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers who did not realize the difficult test she needed to overcome.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"My head was lowered and tears were crumbling all the time.
It's hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt a great deal of pity for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards of mourning women aim to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones by suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys distribute postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and seek help with.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed, and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want even one parent to feel the way I have to feel every day," she said.
Mr. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a promising chef, distinguished by an infectious smile.
"Everybody knew him because of his smile.
They'd always say his smile lit up the room."
However, he quit before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his suicide brother.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid that a chain reaction could happen."
Mr. Davis created postcards, "so that people know that there are people around who can be approached and talked to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk."
Mr. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mr. Davies's, lost his 15-year-old partner, Mark, who retired not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling depressed, depressed and he didn't complain about anything," she said.
"Several days before Christmas, we noticed his changed attitude.
At Christmas, the situation was completely bad: when the kids rolled out their presents, he didn't look them in the eye and he didn't react in any way."
She said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: "In the family it left a void.
It's tearing our heart.
However, we all have to live on and fight."

When the FBI launched an investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future was on the line.
I thought if we could actually get something he asked for - a limited-time and scope inquiry - maybe we would bring some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "rumbling" in the strong grip of supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their contradiction is determined solely by time.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections, to be held on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to turn out poorly, their efforts to elect the desired man to the highest court in the country will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators in an effort to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, a former Bush personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh could get 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cut ties and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
When Kim came to power, the number of North Korean defectors "decreased"
The South Korean legislature said the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea had fallen when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said 1,127 deserters were identified last year compared to 2,706 deserters in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors were tighter control of the North Korean-Chinese border and increased human smuggling prices.
Pyongyang did not make public comments.
Many North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on stalled talks on the renunciation of nuclear weapons.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when the two agreed in principle to push for a nuclear-free zone for the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of not changing their sanctions since then.
"If there is no trust in the U.S., we cannot trust our national security, and under these circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm the former," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these remarks during an interview she gave Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I just can't think that if a woman did that, she would be said to be hysterical," Pelosi voiced her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied accusations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
At the time of his opening speech, when he was talking about family and high school times, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes uninitiated to shout or cry.
He also condemned the Democrats on the committee in full, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated destruction of reputation" allegedly orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed the testimony given by Mr Kavanaugh proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he revealed his biased attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself from his statements and the attack on the Clintons and the Democratic Party," she said.
When asked if he would seek to remove Kavanaugh if his candidacy was approved and the Democrats received a majority of the votes in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
"I'll say yes, if he's lying to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to hold office, not just in the Supreme Court, but in the court he works in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Healthcare Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether to revoke certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to say hysterically, biasedly as a person becomes a judge, 'How wonderful!'" Pelosi said.
The Power Women Should Use
This is a legitimate criticism, a fury eventually spilled for months and even years, which she cannot utter without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem unusual to me, and to you?"
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman, the head of a company, who told me that she was crying too when she got angry, but she developed a certain method: when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to at the time, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm actually angry."
And she just kept crying.
It seemed brilliant to me."
Tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is from one of my first jobs in the office, which was mostly staffed by men and where I once started crying because of unspeakable rage. Then I was grabbed by an older woman behind the scribble, a harsh leader who was always a little bit afraid, and dragged to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," he said to me.
They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to beat you."
Democratic Party congresswoman from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught committing adultery aboard Monkey Business and withdrew his candidacy, deeply disappointed Mr Schroeder decided that there was no reason he could not stand for president himself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," he told me laughingly 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for another one.
Someone called me "Snowball with seven dwarves."
When the campaign started late, there was little time left to raise funds, so she swore she would not announce her candidacy until she raised $2 million.
It was an unequal struggle.
She noticed that some sponsors who donated $1,000 to men only gave 250 to her.
"Maybe they thought I was getting a discount?" she wondered.
In a speech in which she announced that she was launching a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion - gratitude to the people who supported her, a system of frustration that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and directly reach voters rather than representatives, and anger over sexism - that she burst into tears.
"You would have thought I was getting nervous," recalled Schroeder's press reaction to her speech.
You would have thought I was being supported by the Kleenex napkin business.
I remember thinking what would be recorded in my grave monument.
"She was crying?"
How the U.S. and China's trade generations can benefit Beijing
The first salves in the U.S.-China trade war were built up, and although the battle is far from over, according to experts, strife may eventually prove beneficial to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave his first warning this year after taxing major Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The sharpest standoff occurred this week when new tariffs came into effect, affecting goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), essentially taxing half of China's exports to the United States.
Beijing responded to all of the measures with the same: a five to ten percent duty on American goods with a total value of $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight the U.S. tooth for the tooth, and it seems that this world's second largest market is certainly not going to land in the near future.
Washington would only ease the sanctions if China obeyed the demands, but publicly bowing to the U.S. would be too difficult for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its party properly, the difficulties of a trade war with the U.S. may have a positive impact on China in the long run, as it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
"The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington, D.C. or Beijing could create conditions that would cause the economies of both countries to deteriorate is indeed far more dangerous than observers have so far acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, an employee at the Asia New America Security Center.
According to Syria's foreign minister, the country is ready to accept returning refugees
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by the war of more than 7 years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Progress in the fight against terrorism has made the situation in the area much more stable and secure," he said.
The government continues its efforts to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists and restore normality.
All conditions have already been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against everyday life and well-being.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe picks up Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team that beat the U.S. team by a final score of 16.5:10.5 won the 2018 Ryder Cup at the Le Golf National field next to Paris, France.
The United States has lost in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup on this continent since 1993.
Europe reclaimed the crown when a team of Danish-born captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, enough to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, launched a blow from the starting ground right into the water with a 16-hole 3rd paru match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari starred in all rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament gained its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5:4 by the lowest ranked European team player Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest ranked Dustin Johnson lost 2:1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cup tournaments, became this tournament's all-time most successful European player, scoring 25.5 career points.
"I rarely cry, but I can't control myself today.
It was an uneasy year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that we got the cup back.
It's all up to the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," said the emotion-ridden Garcia after the Europeans won.
He hands over the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who beat U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2:1 Sunday unit game.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods - I grew up watching him play," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and he now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is a bizarre statistic for one of the best players of all time, winning 14 of the biggest prizes and landing only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the drive lawn throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showcased high-profile play throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a certain moment this morning when we were putting pressure on the Europeans.
We were fighting.
I'm kneeling a hat against Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
He has to bow his head.
Our opponents were superior."
