I don't like this class.
She's a girl.
We decided that we would have a special wedding.
Wake up.
I'm not afraid of Mary.
Get your hands off of me.
What's the hour?
Do you think this is going to come with me?
How many buildings do you own?
Tom is our friend.
This will be your sleeve.
The next morning, he was playing steam.
Some of our members did not attend the meeting.
I've got a marriage.
They were swimming.
He was lying about where he was that day.
Mum speaks a lot.
How many years have you been there?
Do you have a beer?
On the other side in the bathroom.
How long it's been like this?
I don't like this website.
I am a person.
I hope I play well.
Thank you.
I'd be surprised if anyone could.
I think it's more beautiful than Mary.
I've got to buy a new one.
I can't see you tomorrow.
This happened for the first time.
It's hard to tell what the weather will be like tomorrow.
Love and hate are very strong feelings.
I have to play well.
I can't lie anymore.
I want to know what you can do.
In the morning, Tom was hit by pitch.
I really don't understand the question you asked.
At that time, I was still studying French.
Mary likes the bananas.
If you want to do something right, sometimes you have to do it yourself.
That's just what happened to your unconsciousness.
I feel the same way.
I have to go shopping and shopping.
It's an amazing view?
How many horses do you see today?
I think you should answer your question.
Speaking of.
I just want to be happy.
How many years do you want to buy me?
He's a bad man.
Tom didn't see where he was going, so he fell into the water.
This glove is with you.
What does it mean?
Both love and hatred are extremely emotional.
I can't see you tomorrow.
What's your favorite, fruit, or banana?
That's where no one can find it.
How long it's been going on?
You haven't gone yet, have you?
I don't think I'll get a good grade.
I don't drink that much.
The birds like bananas.
He has a shoe.
I'm not a doctor.
I went to French and taught French language on television.
I'm sorry I forgot to call you.
My brother was my brother yesterday.
How long have you been here?
That's not as scary as you think.
I feel the same way.
Stay at home.
Tom was married to a Canadian man named Maurice.
Many roads are still closed.
The Caliph Tower is the world's tallest building right now.
A lot of people in the crowd are stunning the flags.
Tom didn't see where he was going, but he fell off the bridge.
I'm going to buy a new one.
It's my woman.
The clouds are gone.
She decided to stay home until she came home.
Tom was married to a Canadian woman named Maurice.
Would you give me a glass of water?
Mary is my dollar.
That's what happens when you don't care about yourself.
I'm sorry I forgot to call you.
What do I want from me?
I know you have it.
How many horses do you have today?
It's not easy to make women happy.
I'm pretty sure this is a mistake.
I knew that this box was very small.
I can't see you tomorrow.
It's much better than eating a cow.
Do you think this is going to come with me?
He seems to be calm now.
She was swimming.
It's an unbelievable view?
I think you're the one on this one, aren't you?
I want to learn how to eat in France.
That's what happens when you don't care about yourself.
Wait a minute.
It's hard to predict time is too late.
You're teaching the Bible.
When I looked at the clock, I noticed that it was an hour early.
I fell into the water.
Aren't you always the same as Tom?
Let's see if it's cold.
I think you're going to hit this thread.
We're still trying.
This was the first time that happened.
I'm sorry I forgot to call you.
Yes, sir.
When are the flowers in your garden?
You can't rake
It's like a little bit sick.
I told him to do that.
Which way is best?
I think we've been arrested.
I don't drink that much.
Are you always going to be with Tom?
Me and I were talking to each other in France.
Some of our members did not attend the meeting.
I want to learn how to eat in France.
I haven't spoken a lot to him in French.
I didn't think I could do that, did I?
That's what you're going through?
We don't have any more beer, do we?
Doing a good thing every day
They follow it.
I want to play well.
I want to play well.
I need a big letter.
I've got a marriage.
I don't say that's very difficult.
I'm pretty sure this is a mistake.
You just didn't care about it, that's what happened to you.
I saw this girl.
What do you want from me?
Ted went up in many countries.
I don't like this website.
Come on.
I'll be leaving soon.
I can't see you tomorrow.
Tom isn't a kind of person who does this.
It's raining all day.
I'm a student.
Mum is a very bad guy.
I like the bananas.
When's the wind coming from your garden?
This is indispensable.
I drank beer for the first time in my thirteen year.
How many years did you get in the way?
I didn't understand Tom's anger.
That's not as scary as you think.
On the island, before the island.
I fell into the water.

I hope you enjoy this holiday season.
I think it's more beautiful than Moore.
I'm busy with my homework.
Hello, how are you?
I'm a squirrel.
Your room is at the end of the room.
That's the top horror story.
What's the hour now?
Tom seems to be worried.
"Where'd you put your ass back?" "I left it in school."
I'm sorry I forgot to call you.
It's not too late to turn back.
It's cold outside?
I want to see I'm laughing.
The mouse wasn't very happy.
I'm looking for someone to play with.
I feel the same way.
I think I'm going to stay at home with Maureen.
Tom likes to fool his friends.
I went into the caf√©.
I'm up above.
I'm up above.
I just want to be happy.
There's only one thing I hate about you.
I want to play well.
I'm only 5 minutes late.
Tom is playing outside with his friends.
I'd like to see Tom's face.
The story is scary.
It's not too late backwards.
It's much better to eat meat than bread.
If it's cold right now, I'd be surprised.
So, ask yourself a question.

How many kids did you have?
I've got something to say to TWO.
Tom knows everyone on his way.
Tyler wanted to keep his eyes on them forever.

The birds like bananas.
I'm sorry I forgot to call you.
