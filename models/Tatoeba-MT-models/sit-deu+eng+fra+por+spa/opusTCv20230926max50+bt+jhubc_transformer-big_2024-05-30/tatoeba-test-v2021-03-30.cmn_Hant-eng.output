>>cmn_Hant<< Tomorrow's bad weather, not sunny days, it's snowing, it's cold.
>>cmn_Hant<< Yesterday, what day?
I can't wait for you.
>>cmn_Hant<< You're the one who advised us to travel with us.
This is a paid call from Mr. Nakamura, Osaka.
>>cmn_Hant<< He has great influence in the business world.
>>cmn_Hant<< The British respect the order and order.
I saw him swim through the river.
I forgot to call him today.
I'll take a step.
>>cmn_Hant<< She was happy with the gifts I sent.
>>cmn_Hant<< I want to sink into the sea and disappear in this world, so no one will ever see me again.
He's my brother's friend.
I'll make you a man.
Tom probably knows how to get to Mary's.
Nick doesn't need to come to my office.
He's got a good appetite.
>>cmn_Hant<< The company has 500 employees.
>>cmn_Hant<< This book is useful and the price is also suitable.
She's sitting in a bench.
>>cmn_Hant<< You know who killed them?
>>cmn_Hant<< Please remember!
>>cmn_Hant<< I promise to return this tape back to you in a week.
>>cmn_Hant<< I feel like you'll be a good lawyer in the future.
>>cmn_Hant<< People often say Japanese is hard to learn.
>>cmn_Hant<< Traffic in downtown is blocked.
>>cmn_Hant<< The cops grab thieves' arms.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was almost hit by a car.
She'll be here tonight.
I want to see it.
That will put you in danger.
>>cmn_Hant<< Three plus three equals six.
I hope Tom agrees.
I grew up in the mountains.
This picture is beautiful!
I don't understand what he wants.
I don't want to go out this afternoon.
You ski better than me.
We're in a hurry.
>>cmn_Hant<< Our school was founded in 1990.
I just want to rest.
>>cmn_Hant<< They gave him up for failure.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom hasn't appeared again.
>>cmn_Hant<< To protect ourselves, we just have to lie.
>>cmn_Hant<< He drives one side to listen to the radio music.
What room would you like to book?
You're beautiful.
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you do your own homework yourself?
We need help.
Milk is a mother.
He's much higher than you.
I'm sure they can hear us.
>>cmn_Hant<< No comments yet.
I don't love her.
You better bring your umbrella today.
This is the best book I've ever read.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was used to getting up early.
>>cmn_Hant<< She always talks quietly.
Where are your ankles?
I know, you're busy too.
I'm sorry, I've wrongly opened your letter.
Is it big?
There's a butterfly in the kitchen.
I didn't read yesterday.
Your baggage is overweight.
You have to do it anyway.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom wrote a letter to Mary this morning.
Turn the fire a little.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom was born on May 5, 2010.
>>cmn_Hant<< Carlo returned to her hotel.
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you have matches? Sorry, I don't smoke.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom doesn't eat meat, and Mary does.
>>cmn_Hant<< He's out of control after drinking.
I know everything.
Good morning, everybody.
I arrived at the station this morning.
I think I'm getting a bit of a fever.
Hello, Tom! when did you get here?
>>cmn_Hant<< Let Bob cook.
I suddenly can't remember her name.
>>cmn_Hant<< That's a circus!
I heard him out.
Tom told me I should.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom is afraid of everybody.
>>cmn_Hant<< Life will continue.
>>cmn_Hant<< In Taiwan, the change in the season is becoming unclear. Short spring and short autumn gradually become the characteristics of now four seasons.
>>cmn_Hant<< Kate's face is so bad, it must be sick.
It's snowing.
You can go now.
>>cmn_Hant<< These flowers can be seen around Hokkaido.
Does he look like a doctor?
>>cmn_Hant<< Los Angeles is one of the places I want to go.
>>cmn_Hant<< It will make you think about things you think about.
I heard it from the radio.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom may be vegetarian.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom probably doesn't know why the picnic was cancelled.
I don't want to.
I trust you.
I just finished my homework.
>>cmn_Hant<< He plays the piano, she sings.
He told us a lie.
It's a very traditional ritual.
Tom is crying outside.
How many people can do that?
You're picking up the phone.
>>cmn_Hant<< The weather is hot.
He repaired the watch for me.
You have to move.
I read last night.
I work every day except on Sundays.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mayuko designed her own clothes.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's rude to use someone else's fingers.
I hope she quit smoking.
I'm Doraemon.
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you guys have a gift shop here?
Luke, I'm your cousin.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom and Nancy broke up last month.
>>cmn_Hant<< He put a glue in his hand.
>>cmn_Hant<< I have so many clothes that I don't know what to wear tomorrow.
>>cmn_Hant<< What would you do if you were me?
>>cmn_Hant<< A friend of mine came to see me during the day.
>>cmn_Hant<< He asked me who the painting was.
Do you want another cake?
>>cmn_Hant<< He calls her every night.
>>cmn_Hant<< Can you do me a favor?
He doesn't want to do anything.
>>cmn_Hant<< All you have to do is take the chance to take this hard drive.
>>cmn_Hant<< Brian is holding Kate's hand.
>>cmn_Hant<< The hot and moist weather makes us lazy.
>>cmn_Hant<< The stench is like silver, and the silence is like gold.
You have to wait.
Life is amazing!
I cried all night.
I'm starving!
Who are we?
Why don't you get married?
>>cmn_Hant<< Will you teach me to play guitar?
>>cmn_Hant<< Did you enjoy your party last night?
I don't know what he means.
Time to go.
Call me up at 6 a.m. tomorrow.
I want a seat on the first floor.
>>cmn_Hant<< If he maintains this type of speed warm-up now, the exam qualification is absolutely no problem.
He knows a lot of foreign affairs.
Tom's good to me.
The population of the world is growing by an average of 2<0x25> each year.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom doesn't seem to be Canadian.
>>cmn_Hant<< He made a bookcase for her.
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you have anything to declare?
Choose the racket you like.

>>cmn_Hant<< Tom is in the sanitary room now.
I'm in Rome now.
>>cmn_Hant<< I think it's time for me to buy a house.
What a mess!
Give me the wine, please.
>>cmn_Hant<< He's completely out of kindness.
Tom just came back from the post office.
>>cmn_Hant<< She cooked a great meal for us.
>>cmn_Hant<< Don't be afraid, so he won't think you've brought any prohibited goods and then flip box checking for the wrong time.
I don't understand his jokes.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was injured in the accident.
You have to answer these questions.
She got this ticket for free.
>>cmn_Hant<< I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to monkeys.
I don't want to go to Boston with you.
Can I go to the bathroom?
What happened to your dog?
>>cmn_Hant<< I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I work every day except Sunday.
>>cmn_Hant<< There is no doubt that people initially admire the animals that are most common and closely related to people's lives, such as horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs, etc.
>>cmn_Hant<< He sometimes cooks for us for dinner.
I feed the dog once a day.
>>cmn_Hant<< Last month they climbed Mount Fuji.
Tom doesn't talk to anyone.
Don't forget to skate.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom's books are more than Mary's.

>>cmn_Hant<< Her only pleasure is to listen to music.
Go straight home.

We recommend raising fees.
I'm not here tomorrow.
I need some stamps.
Thank you very much for your help.

>>cmn_Hant<< His new novel will be published next month.
>>cmn_Hant<< His first visit to Japan was ten years ago.

>>cmn_Hant<< There's a trace on the table.
>>cmn_Hant<< My friend is vegetarian, but I didn't tell him there was meat in the soup.

>>cmn_Hant<< Please correct the line words.
>>cmn_Hant<< She made the walls white.
Are you busy?
Are you at Lucy's house tomorrow morning?
I think it should be around here.
Tom paid his wallet.
He's a scary man.
I can't forget her.
I sleep late than usual.
>>cmn_Hant<< We don't know which train they'll take.
>>cmn_Hant<< They sat in the park's bench and talked.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's always hard to have a child to meet parents' expectations.
>>cmn_Hant<< Does anyone understand the French you speak?
Jane didn't go to school today.
>>cmn_Hant<< Don't let anyone enter this room.
Grab the rope.
>>cmn_Hant<< I'm interested in Japanese history.
>>cmn_Hant<< He is now the age, already winning in international competitions and the future is infinite.
It's cold today.
Tom and I are done.
What are you doing there?
I promise I'll put you in jail.
I can't accept the plan.
We were in London last winter.
>>cmn_Hant<< I tried, but I didn't succeed.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was forced to sign on the document.

He promised to come, but he didn't.
>>cmn_Hant<< I'm not used to this kind of treatment.

I'm cold.
Tom lost his job.
Trust me, please.

>>cmn_Hant<< I think everyone should learn another language.
>>cmn_Hant<< John doesn't know what to do next.
>>cmn_Hant<< Is there a doctor on the boat?

It's raining.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mr. Smith doesn't speak English, does he?

>>cmn_Hant<< Honestly, I really want to stay at home and not go out.
>>cmn_Hant<< An old man rests under a tree canopy.
It's Monday.

>>cmn_Hant<< First, I want you to go with me to the department store's specials.
I can go too.

>>cmn_Hant<< There was no radio in Japan at that time.
>>cmn_Hant<< "It's on fire!" he yelled.
I let him brush the house.
I've been dating her for months.
How did you do that?

I thought of a good idea.
He spent the night with his uncle.
Tell her she's cute.
That little boy wears glasses.
>>cmn_Hant<< We ran three kilometers.
>>cmn_Hant<< The community is quiet.
I'll take you to this town.
What does summer vacation mean?
>>cmn_Hant<< Ken painted his bicycle white.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was awakened by the knocking door.
It's an ancient city.
He ate a box of chocolates.
I want another one.
There's something wrong with your writing.
>>cmn_Hant<< Why did you say such a thing?
He must have been drunk last night.
>>cmn_Hant<< "That won't stop," I replied.
Where did you put my luggage?
>>cmn_Hant<< Keep talking and there will be no results.
>>cmn_Hant<< How long have you lived there?
I'll go to the park.
I think English is simple.
This is where the Battle of Hastings took place.

I hope he'll wait for me.
They invited me to play cards.
Let's swim in the river.
Can you move that chair?
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you speak Nami?

We'll have dinner soon.
Both spellings are right.
>>cmn_Hant<< Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
You speak English very well.

>>cmn_Hant<< He told me his grandfather was in his 90s.
>>cmn_Hant<< Want to go out and breathe fresh air?
>>cmn_Hant<< He's a writer, or a politician.
Where do you want to go tomorrow?
It's just for you.
>>cmn_Hant<< There is no silly security system.
That was a beautiful moment.
It's really a good weather.
How fast Tom is working!
Where's your dad?
I'm going to see my uncle tomorrow.
It's not a horse, it's a donkey.
What did you eat?
They came here yesterday.
His father was in the garden.
>>cmn_Hant<< Sorry, but where's the library?
>>cmn_Hant<< You're kidding me!
>>cmn_Hant<< I can't wait to see the new version of Tatoeba.
>>cmn_Hant<< He dropped things and left.
>>cmn_Hant<< After cleaning the window, I can see it clearly out of the window.
>>cmn_Hant<< The school is five kilometres away from my home.
I don't want to see you again!
I collect stamps.
It's a heartbreaking story.
Tom and Mary will come with me.
My grandfather died five years ago.
I'll look at you.
Don't think about it.
Tom's not going to stay.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom says he'll let Mary do it.
>>cmn_Hant<< You speak loud and I can hear you on the first floor.
>>cmn_Hant<< Honestly, I really want to stay at home and not go out.
>>cmn_Hant<< "<0x26>amp; "This symbol is "and" meaning.
He also speaks Russian.
>>cmn_Hant<< Humans are part of nature.
>>cmn_Hant<< Are you a student of this school?
Nature is generous.
They suddenly laughed together.
Have you ever been married?
Yes, I have a student certificate.
I ate Tom's sandwich.
Your cake is delicious.
Please look at my suitcase.
Jane seems to like the party.
He may have left Kyoto.
Today is June 8th, my wife's birthday.
>>cmn_Hant<< He wakes up at 6:30 on the day of school.
Did Tom say something?
They changed the system.
>>cmn_Hant<< The taste of wine is influenced by the weather.

>>cmn_Hant<< This drug is for external use only.
George, how long have you been here?
"Don't cry," she said.
>>cmn_Hant<< I grabbed his arm before he fell down.
>>cmn_Hant<< The more the cheese the more holes. The more holes the less the cheese. Therefore: the less the cheese the less the cheese.
>>cmn_Hant<< He taught English to his friends.
You can have lunch in this room.
>>cmn_Hant<< This girl made a very difficult bow.
>>cmn_Hant<< Nancy is from London.
I'm glad to see you here.
I'm hungry.
This dentist is too expensive.
They're both drunk.
At Tatoeba, you have to always listen to senior members. They'll tell you what you can't do and why.
I want a cold drink.
>>cmn_Hant<< I suddenly thought he might be a business spy.
>>cmn_Hant<< Should we have lunch?
>>cmn_Hant<< She's filled with apples in her bag.
I'm familiar with your face.
>>cmn_Hant<< Don't run away, I want you to answer my question.
>>cmn_Hant<< The soldier keeps alert in the dark.
Who will believe you?
Where do you want to go next?
She's been dead for ten years.
Mom took me to the park.
>>cmn_Hant<< Is there a lot of trees in the park?
>>cmn_Hant<< Who's that guy who's playing the piano?
We have to think about it.
>>cmn_Hant<< I've been busy since last Sunday.
He told me to slow down.
Please retrieve my dry-cleaned clothes.
She doesn't judge beauty.
She asked him to send the letter.
He's back from Sydney today.
I'm actually doing well.
She's with him.

She helped me pack my suitcase.
I'll come if I have time.
I should bring my camera.
>>cmn_Hant<< Bill is in Japan.
What kind of egg do you want?

>>cmn_Hant<< Why do you need this money?
>>cmn_Hant<< Bill was always late for school.
>>cmn_Hant<< The house was on fire in one place.
See me there.
I ate half a sandwich.
How long have you lived in Japan?
It's lovely.
>>cmn_Hant<< Did Tom help his mother yesterday?
I hope to see you again.
>>cmn_Hant<< I feel depressed every Monday.
Tom runs fast.
I'll finish it in five minutes.
>>cmn_Hant<< You know that's a problem?
He knows how to play baseball.
That's all I can find.
The boy's there.
What's your name?
>>cmn_Hant<< The birds don't fly in the air.
I feed my baby's milk.
Rain doesn't allow us to walk.
>>cmn_Hant<< He is allergic to indoor dust.
What's my job?
>>cmn_Hant<< Mars has two natural satellites.
Can I have some more coffee?
>>cmn_Hant<< A word is both spoken, tough to chase.
>>cmn_Hant<< Please eat whatever you want with some fruit.
It's hers.
You can rely on it.
I can do it without her help.
>>cmn_Hant<< Will you drive me home?
Especially with patience.
Bob writes to me once a month.
>>cmn_Hant<< I did so much for him, and he didn't even say thanks.
>>cmn_Hant<< She was engaged to a rich man.
>>cmn_Hant<< The shirt doesn't take that tie.
I can understand you.
I have to go.
She was wearing a white dress.
It's over!
This is bullshit.
I'm sorry, I don't have any change.
She slept in bed yesterday.
>>cmn_Hant<< Once the nuclear war broke out, suffering would be all humans.
>>cmn_Hant<< That book is a new book.
Now it's your turn.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's much simpler for me to speak French than English.
She's giving the baby a bath.
Be careful not to have a cold.
>>cmn_Hant<< We saw many ships in the port.
I'm bathing every morning.
You should learn to control your emotions.
I want to rent a car.
I've been warned not to go there.
I'm cold.
>>cmn_Hant<< He treats me like a stranger.
>>cmn_Hant<< Apple is used as a dessert.
>>cmn_Hant<< Everyone knows that the earth is round.
Let's go to the sea.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's dangerous!
What's his name?
You'll fail.
>>cmn_Hant<< You made a wise choice.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was injured in a traffic accident.
>>cmn_Hant<< If I lost my key, I couldn't lock it.
>>cmn_Hant<< I like to eat grape jelly.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was disqualified for the tournament.
Have a glass of water.
I'm not trying to disturb you.
You can use my new car.
He's gone.
>>cmn_Hant<< The culture of Japan deeply influenced East Asia.
>>cmn_Hant<< The lyrics of the Canadian national anthem were originally written in French.
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't like to let things go unresolved.
Fortunately, she's not dead.
This thing is valuable.
She told me to open the window.
>>cmn_Hant<< He took off the glasses.
I have to go.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom's name is on the list.
>>cmn_Hant<< He presses the emergency button.
He won't listen to my advice.
I've heard her story.
Is 10,000 yen enough?
>>cmn_Hant<< You'll keep your promise, won't you?
>>cmn_Hant<< Today's West Blue Blossoms have been overdone, not very good.
She peeled her eyes.
>>cmn_Hant<< On Saturday, the streets of Tokyo were full of suffering.
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you know who the girl standing at the window is?
Close the door, please.
That's unbelievable.
>>cmn_Hant<< She looked at the young man shyly.
I'm trying to change the subject.
>>cmn_Hant<< Professional writers have no fixed income.
In this world, everything is in it, and everything is in it until it breaks down.
>>cmn_Hant<< The soldiers blocked their way to the city.
Bring the keys.
We don't know what to do.
They're both in the room.
There's a little whiskey in this bottle.
He walked through the house.
I'm from Columbia.
>>cmn_Hant<< Frog at the bottom of the well.
It's late.
>>cmn_Hant<< Who cares when she gets married?
He looks like a good boy.
He heard the scream.
But he doesn't always smile.
>>cmn_Hant<< Whether he comes or not, I'll go.
Please go home as soon as possible.
I like doing my homework.
>>cmn_Hant<< The hen we raised was born a lot of eggs yesterday.
I'm wearing 37.
>>cmn_Hant<< Parents or teachers should make children enjoy reading fun.
Spring has arrived.
There's no need to talk so loud.
You're just listening, not thinking.
He lost a book.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom is a fat guy.
>>cmn_Hant<< I gave up all the hope of survival.
>>cmn_Hant<< He tries to unite different groups.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tatoeba: Sentences are always sentences, unless they are not.
>>cmn_Hant<< The news spread throughout the world within hours.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was the first to come.
Give me the menu, please.
My name is Jack.
What do you want?
>>cmn_Hant<< We're late for the storm's departure.
I know she's Spanish.
I don't drink water.
I want to hear your opinion.
>>cmn_Hant<< Her socks are grey.
>>cmn_Hant<< We haven't seen him since that time.
>>cmn_Hant<< From this point on, you can determine feminism is still necessary.
>>cmn_Hant<< They named them Jane for their baby.
Please let me try this game.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom has lost interest in learning French.
>>cmn_Hant<< We've always got something that's not finished.
How do I change my cell phone?
Everything has two sides. The creator only sees one.
>>cmn_Hant<< Cold drink is better.
>>cmn_Hant<< The United States of America declared its independence to the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1776.
>>cmn_Hant<< Canada's crime rate has declined.
Drink water.
I don't have any money, I don't know where to go.
>>cmn_Hant<< The jar is empty.
>>cmn_Hant<< He whispered loudly, "This battle, we can't lose!"
Control is everything.
I'm speaking Intellectual.
That will put you in danger.
Put your safety cap on.
I'm meeting him tomorrow.
>>cmn_Hant<< They view Joe as the father of English poetry.
We still have some doubts.
My parents don't know.
I want to swim in this river.
>>cmn_Hant<< She forced him to do this job.
We call our dog Johnnie.
>>cmn_Hant<< Understanding the use of a computer is an advantage.
Don't be sad.
Try it again.
>>cmn_Hant<< This needs to be carefully considered.
>>cmn_Hant<< John and Tom are wrestling.
Maybe it's just a coincidence.
The writer is writing a new book.
Do you have any coughing pills?
I want to send them to Japan.
>>cmn_Hant<< She died of stomach cancer.
>>cmn_Hant<< She took the subway in Ginza.
Tom is drinking apple juice.
We think he's honest.
There's good and bad.
I shop every other day.
I really like French food.
>>cmn_Hant<< The water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen.
>>cmn_Hant<< Wang Wang Wang!
She might come.
I'm fine.
>>cmn_Hant<< He used his chances as much as he could.
I can't help you.
They're in line for buses.
"Is he in the car?" he asked. "No, he's in the car."
>>cmn_Hant<< How many weeks did you learn Chinese?
This is Mary's dog.
>>cmn_Hant<< Fifty steps of laughing hundreds.
She's old enough to understand.
We escaped from there.
>>cmn_Hant<< To go to church for a prayer, not immediately becoming a Christian, as if standing in a car's room would not become a car.
How long after you need it?
I really want it.
>>cmn_Hant<< Let's meet in front of the theater.
We're all hungry.
The boy went in through the window.
When do you have to go to sleep?
>>cmn_Hant<< We need more than enough food and clean water.
I can't walk in front. It's too dark.
I'm scared to go alone.
Let's stay here tonight.
You're wonderful.
How much?
>>cmn_Hant<< Time flies.
Tom looks like a cold.
>>cmn_Hant<< I stooped up and dropped the pen on the ground.
>>cmn_Hant<< Cold air and wind stomp the whole house.
She's got the guts to say.
>>cmn_Hant<< Let's wait here until he comes back.
Our teacher loves his new car.
I'm thirsty.
Look! she's here!
>>cmn_Hant<< The French ate the defeat at the Battle of Waterloo.
These are his stationery.
>>cmn_Hant<< She went to Italy to study music.
I'm going to have a exaggerated milk.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is the castle's venue.
>>cmn_Hant<< Very few Japanese can use English well.
I have no problem with the boss.
Thank you for your help.
>>cmn_Hant<< This may not be a real diamond.
We look forward to receiving this year.
Why don't we have dinner?
I know what you mean.
You've been good before. It's better now.
I decided not to learn French.
>>cmn_Hant<< I think you should do it before you get home today.
I'm starving!
>>cmn_Hant<< From then on, he put his whole soul into his work.
>>cmn_Hant<< Three cubes are twenty-seven.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system.
>>cmn_Hant<< My first impression of him was not wrong.
My house is on the outskirts of that city.
>>cmn_Hant<< The universe has no edge.
I can only speak on my own.
He's off the bus.
They said hello to me with a smile.
Look at my new car.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's weird that he was placed in this cheap hotel.
I hope so.
Would you like some more beer?
>>cmn_Hant<< He went to Austria to read music.
We shower every day.
I think your answer is right.
>>cmn_Hant<< We discussed that question for a long time.
Don't deal with this guy.
She'll be back at 5:00.
>>cmn_Hant<< My father was too busy to go for a walk.
He's Taro's brother.
>>cmn_Hant<< This rumor is credible.
Don't be afraid.
He pulled me to the second floor.
I totally agree with you.
>>cmn_Hant<< They're all looking for this lost child.
>>cmn_Hant<< At first, he wouldn't speak English.
I must have hit the wrong number.
>>cmn_Hant<< All participants must be registered.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom lives three miles east of this place.
Someone's looking for you.
>>cmn_Hant<< He is interested in collecting insects.
How high is Mount Fuji?
I want some fresh fish.
He's the doctor I mentioned last night.
>>cmn_Hant<< Fifty years ago, television, computers like this were simply skyscrapers.
I think I'm gonna take the bus.
I need my coat.
>>cmn_Hant<< The relative to the animals named is because our predecessors are closely related to these animals.
He's really good at it.
I'm going.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although Flash's content cannot be shown on iPad, only to send the URL of the web to its own mailbox, home can be viewed in a common computer.
I usually take a shower at night.
You better wear a raincoat.
>>cmn_Hant<< For Tom, everything started to go wrong.
Your team is stronger than ours.
Tom said he had a gun in his house.
Worry it's useless.
>>cmn_Hant<< I go to the library twice, three times a week.
>>cmn_Hant<< He insisted on the original plan.
She's dead.
>>cmn_Hant<< Have they ever been here on time?
>>cmn_Hant<< Did you report it?
He introduced his daughter to me.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is clear that there is a strong difference between the two.
I still live in my father's house.
He's three inches taller than me.
I don't blame you for doing that.
>>cmn_Hant<< Can you solve this problem?
I haven't had much time to read.
>>cmn_Hant<< Japanese history is my favorite subject.
Do you have a bath in the room?
>>cmn_Hant<< I'll follow you wherever you go.
>>cmn_Hant<< She made a new set of clothes for him.
>>cmn_Hant<< As far as I know, he's an honest man.
It's not about him.
>>cmn_Hant<< There are four seasons a year.
That was a month ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< She tightens the package with a rope.
Write down his address.
My income decreased by 10 percent.
Her mother made her a new dress.
>>cmn_Hant<< My father didn't eat much fruit.
>>cmn_Hant<< He stopped halfway between Los Angeles and Chicago.
The dress's not prevalent now.
Do you accept credit cards?
>>cmn_Hant<< Can you take me with you?
I make 100 euros a day.
>>cmn_Hant<< What you need to learn is real skills, not just superficial knowledge.
This investment guarantees a return of 6<0x25>.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom wants to go to Japan.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's all humans make mistakes. Blame others for your own mistakes, especially what humans do.
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you know who invented the microscope?
>>cmn_Hant<< Nothing can make me angry more than seeing an animal being beaten.
>>cmn_Hant<< Did you hear a click?
I'll pay you back right away.
I owe him my success.
Close the door, please.
>>cmn_Hant<< The trail in the mountain is full of soft fall leaves, and it's good to go.
>>cmn_Hant<< You should try harder to learn.
They don't even know why.
>>cmn_Hant<< You want some more cake?
>>cmn_Hant<< It's an appliance for shrimp clothes.
>>cmn_Hant<< He has great potential.
I don't understand.
>>cmn_Hant<< He slowly drank hot coffee.
I need a place to read.
This house is big.
I don't speak Japanese.
Let me see.
You're so good.
You know who I am.
>>cmn_Hant<< I always rely on him when I'm in trouble.
That's what I want.
My brother gave me a cute doll.
He's speeding up.
I really want to write a lot of sentences in Tatoeba, but I have something else to do.
>>cmn_Hant<< Is English harder than Japanese?
>>cmn_Hant<< His legs were intertwined.
She's supposed to be here now.
Maybe I've read this book.
He's only <0x24>100.
My name is Ricardo, and you?
Come on!
You said too much.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mike had a tooth check last week.
This can't help you.
>>cmn_Hant<< She went to school almost late.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although he apologized, I was still angry.
>>cmn_Hant<< Birds drop eggs.
I used to swim here every day.
One day, Summerstone was lost in London.
Don't be shy.
>>cmn_Hant<< The nail grows four times faster than the feet.
Look at the rain tomorrow!
>>cmn_Hant<< He's always picking people's problems.
Where's my umbrella?
>>cmn_Hant<< Repair my bike cost me a thousand yen.
He's a good man.
>>cmn_Hant<< Brown coal is a fossil fuel.
I asked Nancy to stay home.
I'd love to eat some mushrooms.
Tom has to be old to work.
I left my business on the bus.
She's been in hospital for a month.
It's only a mile from my house.
It's not my food.
She takes a shower every morning.
He's very honest.
>>cmn_Hant<< He can solve this problem.
She's a great swimmer.
Do you believe in God?
>>cmn_Hant<< Please put the book on the shelf.
You've got a good reason.
I borrowed money from my father.
I'm against his bill.
>>cmn_Hant<< Save in a cool place.
>>cmn_Hant<< Little Ming's self-control is poor.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mike was elected president.
>>cmn_Hant<< A few days ago, a horrible thing happened outside Tokyo.
>>cmn_Hant<< All the old jokes that comedians say we've heard before.
I know he's busy.
>>cmn_Hant<< Don't look at people by appearance.
>>cmn_Hant<< He won the chess match.
I can run faster than Ken.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mary dyes her hair into blue.
I want to go to America.
>>cmn_Hant<< Half the bread is better than nothing.
You do better than me.
I'm familiar with those tall girls.
She's the woman I want.
Maybe I should tell Tom the truth.
>>cmn_Hant<< India is the seventh largest country in the world.
Her daughters are beautiful.
>>cmn_Hant<< Kate hardly speaks Chinese.
>>cmn_Hant<< More and more people travel to rural areas.
>>cmn_Hant<< You should learn to shut your mouth.
Can you open the door, please?
>>cmn_Hant<< Can I open my eyes now?
>>cmn_Hant<< They go to church every Sunday for a week.
>>cmn_Hant<< Money doesn't grow out of trees.
He's afraid of making mistakes.
>>cmn_Hant<< She gave him a gentle kiss.
What are you suggesting?
Have you ever loved a man?
>>cmn_Hant<< She asked the matter personally.
I can't stand it.
>>cmn_Hant<< Why didn't you listen to his advice?
>>cmn_Hant<< He has a good character.
>>cmn_Hant<< In my experience, mastering French grammar takes a year.
I want massage. I need to relax.
We'll have guests tomorrow.
Do you understand?
>>cmn_Hant<< The pool is open to the public.
>>cmn_Hant<< There are holes on the ceiling.
>>cmn_Hant<< Sally lost the contact glasses he bought the day before.
>>cmn_Hant<< Apple this year is particularly sweet.
You have to send someone to the doctor.
He didn't give me anything.
It'll take an hour to go there.
I'll do it.
>>cmn_Hant<< I ran as hard as I could, but I still didn't catch the train.
You're going fast!
>>cmn_Hant<< There's a painting on the wall.
>>cmn_Hant<< Many people speak only one language.
>>cmn_Hant<< I'm not always right, I just correct you always when you make a mistake.
Peace on the way!
>>cmn_Hant<< I can put my hands on the ground without a curve.
>>cmn_Hant<< "Did he write a letter yesterday?" "Yes, he wrote.
I'm disappointed I couldn't go with her.
>>cmn_Hant<< Can I try this?
It's really cheap.
>>cmn_Hant<< I'm very confused about his problem.
I think this table is down.
>>cmn_Hant<< He managed to pass through the crowd.
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you know what differences are between microscopes and telescopes?
I don't dare kill animals.
He's alone there.
I used to be there.
I'll lend it to you.
I'll be there sooner next time.
I know him.
It's almost finished.
>>cmn_Hant<< I went to the prom, and my mother helped take care of the baby.
My dog is always following me.
>>cmn_Hant<< There are too many books on your bookshelf.
I don't know if he loves me.
>>cmn_Hant<< How's your fingerprint on this glass?
I can't buy a new car this year.
It's simpler than doing it.
>>cmn_Hant<< We hear the roar of a distant tiger.
Where's the boss?
The flight's canceled.
>>cmn_Hant<< He opposes racism.
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you walk to school every day?
I was with him the same year.
That's not good.
>>cmn_Hant<< I see fruit as the healthiest food.
>>cmn_Hant<< He saved the baby, but sacrificed his own life.
We accept checks.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
>>cmn_Hant<< Regardless of how cold it is outside, the room is always comfortable and warm.
He stole my sister's toys.
>>cmn_Hant<< The school needs a new teacher.
>>cmn_Hant<< You shouldn't read in such a dark room.
>>cmn_Hant<< The fire is very dangerous.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is a turning point of history.
Where's my watch?
>>cmn_Hant<< Many believe that all foreign-made goods are superior to those made in their own country.
>>cmn_Hant<< You killed my father, I'm going to avenge him today.
>>cmn_Hant<< How long have you known Jack?
>>cmn_Hant<< What a strong wind!
Look at the picture on the table.
>>cmn_Hant<< Our school has a history of 50 years.
What do you want to do tomorrow?
I don't know how to use it.
>>cmn_Hant<< Did you hear about yesterday's fire?
>>cmn_Hant<< Please close the account.
>>cmn_Hant<< This book is for a student who is not a Japanese native speaker.
Tom likes to swim.
>>cmn_Hant<< He went to Nagoya for business trips.
It'll be cold tonight.
>>cmn_Hant<< I called my son before I got on board and asked him to pick me up at the airport.
I want to be my secretary.
I'll catch them soon.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was walking in the park yesterday.
I visited Fukuoka 10 years ago.
He lost his umbrella again.
This one is still alive.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom says he's happy Mary graduated.
>>cmn_Hant<< This dress cost me 40,000 yen.
>>cmn_Hant<< It looks like it's going to snow, doesn't it?
I think I'd better stay here.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom's purpose was clear.
>>cmn_Hant<< I didn't have time to wash the dishes these two days, and now the kitchen is packed with a bowl dish.
This button's fine.
How are you?
I'm looking forward to it.
This boy loves to paint.
>>cmn_Hant<< Jim takes the bus to school.
What does it contain?
We're ready to leave.
I heard a noise.
>>cmn_Hant<< You may not remember me, but I remember you.
>>cmn_Hant<< Silvio Berlusconi, in addition to being an Italian politician and incumbent Italian Prime Minister, was also a successful businessman.
Nancy invited him to a party.
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't think the project is very smart.
>>cmn_Hant<< He never went to school late.
>>cmn_Hant<< You can order some rules for me to keep everyone.
I woke up at 5:00 this morning.
>>cmn_Hant<< There's no hat in that store that matches my size.
>>cmn_Hant<< By the time he arrived at the train station, the train had been driving for almost half an hour.
She looks very elegant.
I like to make fun of you.
Who do you usually go to the movie?
How much is your suitcase?
Hello.
He stayed at his aunt's house.
>>cmn_Hant<< You're so cold and ruthless.
>>cmn_Hant<< She speaks fluently in French.
>>cmn_Hant<< When I was about to go out, the phone was ringing.
>>cmn_Hant<< Who do you think is wrong?
>>cmn_Hant<< The girl's eyes are full of tears.
He's a good student.
He's good at playing guitar.
>>cmn_Hant<< The aircraft is the fastest way to travel.
>>cmn_Hant<< Almost all the work is done.
This pen is better than that.
>>cmn_Hant<< She quickly cleaned her room.
>>cmn_Hant<< Can you give me the salt, please?
>>cmn_Hant<< He looks up at the sky.
You think too much.
>>cmn_Hant<< Kentaro stays with his friends in Kyoto.
>>cmn_Hant<< For the people of these countries, hunger is normal.
>>cmn_Hant<< He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
>>cmn_Hant<< The business faces the deficit.
I heard Mary wanted a divorce.
I sleep late at night.
It's almost three o'clock.
>>cmn_Hant<< I was born on February 14, 1960.
Tom didn't want to do that.
She's obviously sick.
No, I don't speak English.
She's Brazilian.
You should help him.
>>cmn_Hant<< I wasn't really scared until then.
>>cmn_Hant<< He had a very hard day after his job loss.
I'm trying not to think about it.
We're a family.
>>cmn_Hant<< You shouldn't lend money to someone like that.
Tom's a good guy.
>>cmn_Hant<< This work has been completed in half.
>>cmn_Hant<< He bought a dress for his daughter.
>>cmn_Hant<< She finally arrived at the hotel.
You're treated unfairly.
>>cmn_Hant<< He should buy a new bike for his son.
You lack patience.
>>cmn_Hant<< He knocked the opponent down.
You might tell me everything.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's always wrong to be careful over the road.
>>cmn_Hant<< The grass is easy to grow, evil is easy to dye.
I told her you were a good girl.
Tom doesn't want us to help.
>>cmn_Hant<< Give me back the book after you've finished reading.
>>cmn_Hant<< During the hot season, some foods can easily be broken.
>>cmn_Hant<< She occasionally has a depressing mood.
If you can come.
I've cleaned my room.
Don't forget about me.
Thank you. I'm tired.
I'm sorry to bother you.
What a wonderful weather!
I want to go to America.
>>cmn_Hant<< Bob would drive too.
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you agree with what he said in the book?
When this lady learns that she has won millions of dollars, she's really insane.
She travels around the world.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's really cool, both of these things are still being repaired now.
Do you like fish?
Tom told them not to do that.
>>cmn_Hant<< You want some scrambled eggs?
It's snowing.
>>cmn_Hant<< My boss tried to take me cheap, and I slap him in his hand so he could no longer have a haircut.
I hope you're healthy.
I really like your company.
I can understand what she's saying.
Do you have a smaller size?
>>cmn_Hant<< As she opens the door, a cat runs out.
>>cmn_Hant<< The wound flows out of the lungs.
He's working harder than you.
I heard he's dead.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mother-birds come to worms feed young birds.
I took pictures for my family.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was fired by the factory's boss.
Thank you for picking me up.
I guess you're right.
I'll wait until 4:00.
>>cmn_Hant<< We discussed three hours, but there was no progress.
>>cmn_Hant<< He may have missed the last train.
>>cmn_Hant<< Today's lowest temperature is three degrees.
We import tea from India.
>>cmn_Hant<< If you haven't paid yet because of what we did to make you unhappy, can you tell us?
She's got a big chest.
Would you like a coffee?
She left home ten minutes ago.
I don't like it very much.
What do you want to eat?
I had to stay in bed all day.
>>cmn_Hant<< The two groups did not perform well in the match.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mercury is the smallest of the solar system's eight planets.
He's shorter than Tom.
>>cmn_Hant<< She's a girl, but she's brave.
>>cmn_Hant<< Happy Christmas!
We got what we wanted.
I don't know.
