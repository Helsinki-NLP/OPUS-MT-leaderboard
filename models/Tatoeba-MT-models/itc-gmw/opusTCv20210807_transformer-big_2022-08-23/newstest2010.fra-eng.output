Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy schedule.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then includes an interview with the King of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will be at its height in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the award in the Committee's own chamber.
The White House said in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he receives this award as a president who is fighting a war in two countries at the moment.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to emphasize.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate to charities, but he has not yet decided which ones.
His busy schedule will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at that price at first.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He has also repeated several times that this is not a prize for him alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
At the time of the announcement, he said it would be an “invitation to act.”
A Nature Defender Accused of Blackmail
Police in Litomice have charged the president of the Litomice Society of Nature Protectors with blackmail.
Several times last year he appealed for several construction yard procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for withdrawing his call, said Alena Romová, a spokesman for the Litomice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom?ice is Lubomír Studni?ka.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague, everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you stumble upon sorting bins at every corner.
What about Brno?
There, you would need to take several minutes before you find the right trucks.
I'm not saying we wouldn't sort waste in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that the city councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of dumpsters dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires mostly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found for now is Moravian Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't mind me, but it seems damn little to me.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city this is not a sinecure either.
So finally, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
Out of laziness.
It gives them a jog to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, offered to go throw away a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colored bins on Kounicova Street.
Luckily I found the right place to go by tram.
However, the waste was overflowing.
After all, it is the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is probably that ecology and an alleged aestheticism do not interest the Socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying a few extra dumbbells and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I’m glad I was able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after hanging out on the internet for a while.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole region of South Moravia.
The budget of Paroubek has removed silver pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the advice of the government, farmers or even officials, there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international legal proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some classes, they relied on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave.
It is important to know that on the borrowed money the interest payable is increasing and that it will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The state doesn’t really have a choice about where to make money.
If he doesn't cut his welfare or his spending, he'll have to raise taxes.
To all that the left has now increased: the firefighters, the teachers, the farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and do not have to fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater state debt - next year it will not be missing 163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and with it, interest-related expenses.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
It will also miss five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and initiated sections of which it is not possible to modify the projects to reduce costs.
At most, keep them, which is not free either.
That means delaying or stopping 30 major yards, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The SSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very skilfully - it will draw on the dividends of the EZ (electricity supplier and distributor), which the state has in large part and will feed into the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no way a bottomless well.
Last year, $18 billion was flown from the EEZ into the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts, or as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GNP under EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, even housing savings, has fallen by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, Janota notes.
The minister will then have to save on the department’s side or, at worst, touch the government’s budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing from the two-billion-dollar state fund project, which is expected to track each administration's spending online.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed look promising.
All it takes is a button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which deals mainly with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new mobile phone technologies is booming.
VMware is now collaborating with European and U.S. carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to the devices by 2012.
Snow scarcity in the mountains bothers hoteliers
Desert trails are not the only problem for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users go through the offers, ask for the prices but do not dare to commit to booking at the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas,” said Martin Jandura, operator of the news portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Pindler, it is better not to hesitate to book.
If you give priority to savings and the quality of the accommodation comes only afterwards, then you can try to wait a few more days.
At the moment, the hoteliers of Pindler only offer a week-long stay for New Year's Eve.
I think they’ll try to place them for another moment, but they’ll also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease,” Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week is the most interesting for us at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas trips,” said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer New Year’s Eve in Krkonoshe, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February start just as well, the remaining winter stays sell on average.
This year's interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoce.
People are waiting for it to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be complete,” says Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Snëkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We still have a few last places for New Year’s and Christmas.
There is a lot of interest during the Polish January holidays and February sells well as well," says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central car park in Jánské Lázn? is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázn?.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupation at the moment.
February is a bit weaker at the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkono?e will certainly grow again, said the manager of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, hoteliers in Krkono?e should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rainfall, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, the weather is expected to warm, informs Ji? Jakubsk? of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It even becomes comical, the diligent effort with which Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of a sage, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he himself considered to be quite simple.
When he ended up letting his long-awaited doctrine sweat, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of the Bush speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into a civil war-torn Iraq as being “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the papers at present do not speak at all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, but, objectively speaking, it left his successor with a much more favorable final situation than could be expected.
Barack Obama hopes the miracle will happen again in Afghanistan
It was again campaign commanders who called for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least scammed the 10,000-strong general.
He managed to remove the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he was originally counting on 10,000.
What causes the most problems in the entire Obama strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete the whole process within three years.
Many doubt that a halving increase will bring the same fruits as progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan stands out as the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaties are respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders day by day according to what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only the dust in the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is unusually complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity about the relationships, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a “quick-to-act state”, which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is perplexing because of his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out-of-the-box heart can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "coming home soon" will bring about a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will view it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is turning negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the enhanced sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of a solution of the problem through the use of military force.
For example, it will have to be answered when, according to Obama, America comes to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will bring about a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only hurdle for Obama is the fact that he has three years left until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for him to plan for a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash premiums
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this in response to heavy criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 top executives will receive shares instead of money, which they won’t be able to resell for five years.
Actions can be withdrawn from leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link remunerations with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of the company JPMorgan
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the advent of the financial crisis, the high premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political topic in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it expects to allocate a one-time tax of fifty percent on bankers’ bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields besides physics.
Five women, a record number, were awarded the Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and literature today in Stockholm by the Swedish King Charles XVI Gustav.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, and their compatriot Jack Szostak received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The Chemistry Prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The latest winner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn’t have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each laureate received the diploma, Nobel medal and certificate of acquisition of the monetary award.
It reaches 10 million Swedish kronor in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward among themselves.
The much-anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his award, since he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To the discharge of his policy he added that in some situations war is indispensable to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is weighing his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the public finance crisis.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed of the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his role Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday validated the left's proposals on money transfers and increased the remuneration of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats' proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, disagreement that questioned the future of Fischer's cabinet that had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as voted by MPs, removes Fischer's government's package of savings measures, which he believes must curb the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but is under no obligation to do so, said today in a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs that politicians have long overlooked the “serious problem” of the “irreprehensible deficit” of public finances.
At present, he believes, there is no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement if it could rely on a broader political party consensus, according to the president.
SDG President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is scary and the government should question its later existence.
SDG Vice-President Petr Neșas told the TK that the idea of an administrative cabinet backed by the SSD, the SDG and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
SSD leader Ji? Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is appalling and will exceed 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday, the SSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to Play Mandela in New Clint Eastwood Movie
Despite criticism that the lead roles are played by American actors, South Africans say the new Hollywood film Invictus - Inconquered will expose the world to a lot of things about the country, its fights and victories.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman stars in the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a ninety-eleven-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally..
The 72-year-old actor who was awarded an award for his role in Clint Eastwood’s Million Dollar Baby drama set in the middle of boxing has, for example, played the leader of an anti-slavery movement that became himself a slave, a fictional U.S. president, or even God in the movie Evan Almighty is as much a living person as he is a living person.
The former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his hard work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is an unconquered Latin word and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country.The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the world's leading outsiders.
The South African team will eventually progress to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in a way that brought it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dine with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I felt like I knew how you feel, he said.
It’s important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie.'"
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the leadership of the director Eastwood received positive reviews and we even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.
Daily Variety film reviewer Todd McCarthy summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well directed film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway has been solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed above Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the “Bulava” type missile that was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the tests of the rocket did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got damaged in mid-flight.
Russian Newspapers Call “Bulava” the “missile that doesn’t fly”
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th attempt was normal at first.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the aircraft again.
It was obviously the engine on the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew off the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving and submerged boat
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a faulty "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk about failure at all.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and damage only hit the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the trial launches went smoothly, the Department of Defense management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they always affirm that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will appear again in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably enter already in Friday’s match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details on the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest professional Russian hockey player.
In the NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov quintet, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union, he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in the NHL where twice he held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Noçovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Vank of the Hyundai plant confirmed this.
However, the management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday still worked this year.
“We can’t give up our production plan, it’s essential, which is why volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, knowing that there would be two teams,” Vank said.
Sedmi-ka.cz said the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of Saturday's team.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vank, has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can take a replacement leave on December 28th and thus extend their holiday season.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and demands of unions and employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vank said.
Until last week, employees at the auto plant were forced to work almost two overtime hours on a daily basis in addition to their eight hours.
The unions plan to cancel the strike after the agreement is signed.
The next negotiation between the management of the auto plant and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Union leader Petr Kuchas said on Wednesday they were ready to end the strike if they agreed on their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation at the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and so-called hoarding.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work extra to meet the requirements for automobile production.
During the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also called for workers who stopped production not to be subject to any sanctions.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a reward of 5,000 kronor (about €209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in Noçovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started serial production last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "endurant" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow down the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality, in some cases, takes precedence over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on common variants of the virus as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS right now.
However, it is possible to radically prolong the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption causes a number of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VICHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg, paves the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a way different from all drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings on virus proteins.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease, there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, it will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers say in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test specimens as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which the current drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to examine further to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína ?ez?ová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry.
The ODS is attacking Fischer, who is defending
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek, called the ratified budget for the following year "shocking" and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The prime minister called the SDG’s remarks a drastic verdict.
He says he takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Neșas said the idea of an administrative cabinet backed by the SSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
The head of government should decide whether to support the minority in the House of Representatives who are concerned with fighting the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Neșas warned that the positions of the SDG and the Social Democrats regarding the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but proposed amendments amounting to 12 billion kronor included by the left.
The House increased money for civil servants' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance with the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The SDG left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that a modified budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still think about the current situation.
He is convinced that if Janota threatens to step down if the proposed amendments are ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment Monday with the prime minister after his time in government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Nesas believes that the representatives of the SSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will step down if the House ratifies other deficit-increasing legislation such as health insurance, pensions, or service law reform.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDG are not at issue.
This is the business of the head of the Fischer government and the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the SDG did nothing harmful, Topolánek said in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are claiming TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
He stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, “it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House.”
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I haven't thought about it and once it's on the agenda then I'll focus on it," Defense Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats, told reporters in the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The SDG has backtracked at the Prime Minister’s request.
At the same time, he pointed out that the SDG would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked Democratic MPs to allow the budget vote.
We don't feel like we're orphans, we're not small children, he responded to the question of whether the SDG had not been reproached by the President of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote was missing.
I already knew at the time that I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolshevisation of the House and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek responded in person.
According to the new schedules of the D there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
Czech Railways will abolish or limit some less-charged express or regional trains from 13 December and will instead reinforce some others.
Total transport coverage will decrease on the day of entry into force of the new schedules by two per cent compared to today.
Most pricing will not change, including basic rates and discounted rate.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - ?eské Bud?jovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad line will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the region of Hradec Králové by eight percent in total, while Prague and its surroundings can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - ?eské Bud?jovice line are also cancelled and the running of a few express trains on the Prague - Písek - ?eské Bud?jovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for now the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague’s main train station (Praha Hlavní nádra?).
The D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Umperk/Jeseník will depart every two hours.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
This year’s invoice for regional railways: an additional 200 million kronor.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways a total of four billion crowns next year to pay the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate at the amount of almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not use a price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only affect one-day tickets and discounted internet tickets.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of D Net will increase from 450 to 600 kronor.
The price of eLi?ka will depend on the route travelled, while until then it was valid between cities of a region of your choice and was at a single rate of 160 kronor.
Philippine rebels still holding more than 50 people, children released
The rebels kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed, but spoke originally of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during a police escape.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP news agency, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused during a settlement between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the southern Philippines province of Maguindanao over a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of the southern Philippine province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, along with his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the Ampatuan influential lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the US theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora?en?), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the globally known apartheid fighter came to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion has been awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback of critics and audiences is heard.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film holds high hopes as it is presented at a time when, on the one hand, South Africa is in the midst of preparations for the football World Cup, and on the other hand because the media is agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP, the reactions to the new film are at the moment quite positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars “walk”.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and prepared myself well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela many times personally to be able – as they say – to recover from his energy, he said at the film’s official premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember Mandela’s personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual he added.
Wear the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by the British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his tenure as president.
Morgan Freeman tried during the film to gather two racial groups from a long-divided population, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he wore the South African national jersey on the World Cup lawn, which South Africa had then won.
For showing up on the jersey lawn, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela had long been ovated by mostly white audiences fourteen years ago and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will bring people together again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
South African whites are skeptical, however, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain, recently told LN.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the region of Louny
A fire in the morning engulfed a transformer of the eps company of the distribution center near the municipality of Väkov na Lounsku.
According to Lukâ Marvan, a spokesman for the firefighters in Isti, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokeswoman of the company Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission set.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, the company has not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
The supply of electricity was not interrupted, says the spokeswoman of the company for the North Bohemia Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of the fireplaces, administrations and industries was not influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.S. EPS is the exclusive operator of 400 kV and 220 kV power lines and transmission systems in the Czech Republic.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transport assemblies to distribution assemblies and 4339 kilometres long line layouts.
Janura to file defamation lawsuit against three SSD prefects
Radim Janura, owner of the Student Agency, will file a defamation lawsuit against three Democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hasek of the region of South Moravia, against Radko Martínka of the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesa?k.
Janura reported this in Dvacet minuto of Radio urnál.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of them attacked us and claim that we are making the fine mouths, while we have only made an offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It's in exchange for slander on the Student Agency, Jan'ura told Radio Urnál.
He also said he has evidence that no region has acted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Mr. Hasek believes that Mr. Jansura’s complaint represents the continuation of his media show, which serves as a free advertisement for his company and for his person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr. Janura who is manipulating public opinion and resorting to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hasek.
Janura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million kronor in an advertisement that will mention the unfavorable steps of the regions.
He told Radio Urnál that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he plans to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption broadly.
Janura started its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the rail links for an order of about 150 billion kronor, without issuing tenders.
According to Janura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats from a member of the SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the SSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name," Janura told Radio Urnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcal will reverse old habits as early as January.
She will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal infections.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination started last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal infections.
However, the parents paid 1,600 kronor or more for one dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that each year health insurance spends 300-450,000 kronor on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 kronor a year on all children’s vaccinations.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisonings.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions about a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be paid by insurance and optional.
For example, Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk said mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think that is a direction that must now be followed, said Kalovsk.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not considering it at all at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr?e?.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that vaccination based on volunteering is flawed.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a reduction in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum, I understand the decision making vaccination optional," says Cabrnochová, however.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
The pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break from the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves.
This, however, is related to the concerns of pediatric practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by the insurance companies, with the doctors receiving them in the same manner as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some MPs feared, however, that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct health insurance amounts."
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to individually invest nearly 40,000 kronor per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum flight"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million ($12 million) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and into a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the museum into the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of such characters as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying that the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been allowed by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Frazetta Senior has denied giving such permission, the agency said.
Labour is calling for an increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories said Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also drew lightning by tackling low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a 1% ceiling rate on public salaries from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are being penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" were being announced.
The decline in Social Insurance – which will bring in about GBP 3 billion a year – has angered the business world, because he says it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be to revive the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small companies has been abandoned
Discounts on taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and a person earning GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while a person earning GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 was “difficult decisions” but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would weigh on the top 5 percent of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, refuted an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in spending was a “drop in the ocean” compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and that economic growth would restart at the end of the year.
However, Labour’s forecasts for economic growth – which will influence how much it will have to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be filled – have been questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely fall by 4.75% this year – far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than previously estimated.
"Opportunity Missed"
Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday to warn against Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the plan to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to come up with a credible plan on how to repay, they added, evading “cynically” difficult choices until after the elections – which are due to take place in June 2010.
“They didn’t present anything significant about what they were going to do,” said Philip Hammond, Chief Treasury Secretary of the Phantom Cabinet. “They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it.”
“Important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to Tory proposals that would result in a faster and larger decrease in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems said the money raised from the tax hikes and spending cuts would be used to support next year’s spending, not to cut the deficit, arguing the plans were “built on wind.”
Nick Robinson, the BBC’s political editor, claimed that the timing of the announcements – such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits in April, mentioned above – would leave the Chancellor facing accusations of propaganda, the money being simply recovered the following year.
However, LeLabour insists that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
While ministers did not release spending details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that public spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has stated that the Chancellor’s figures mean substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including potentially transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“The pain is actually only postponed,” said director Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner,” said Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s Economic Advisor to Accountants.
"This was a fake pre-budget report, and the markets are realizing it."
FBI Investigates 'American Arrests in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their home in Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani ancestry, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are being held," Kelly said.
Katherine Schweit, an FBI spokeswoman, said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of the men’s uncles.
She said the house was already under surveillance by local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the U.S. should "collaborate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing from their homes in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian 'abuse'
Over the past 20 years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to Amnesty International’s report.
The report presents “repeatments of violations” by the regime, both before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report claimed he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities have claimed that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the biggest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the start of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer science student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting against the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
“I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bloody and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, losing candidate Mehdi Karroubi said protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty has agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary should set up a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government’s response, but it said the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in an effort to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn the Bristol site into a competition runway.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park runway, a small springboard preceded a 100m long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but it was pretty intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shining below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Awards have rewarded the best voltiges - or figures made on the track.
After the party on Thursday night, the snow will be left at the melt.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim Woman Marry a Non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that worry the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen generally agree with their purist Sunni Islam advocates associated with Saudi Arabia who today make up a small part of Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how committed French politicians (and the intellectual elite who are so virulent guardians of secularism) really are to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoilt, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a “narrowness of key values.”
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson, then a brave 14-year-old aspirant who only had to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, caught swimming alongside their newly killed mother, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous spectacle gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still usually one millionth the surface area needed for a free adult. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has turned green due to the algae growing in its thick fur.

Dr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often recounts the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter fighters and Motocross Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and scary summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse into what the future may look like there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's not a mistake to try.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering voyages provided the first information on the melting of the ice sheet.
Cold War submarines then mapped the relief changes underneath it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary, tiny world of the Arctic ice dependency system, formed by the fillets of brackish water pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it may be our turn.”
Marines among 6,000 people who placed crowns on tombs in Arlington
De'Angello Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus ride to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
“In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happens to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, which is why I’m just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on veterans’ graves, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
This is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It’s like visiting a family grave.
Stuffed in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient tombs, dating from World War I and World War II, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not as often visited as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples held hands, wearing the fresh pine crowns on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
There was silence on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of current wars filled the area.
Individuals wept without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned over to see the small black and white information cards, thrust into the damp earth for those whose tomb had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears at her son’s grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and had driven eight hours to come and gather at the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget how free we are... my son paid for it, she said.
“Long after I’m gone, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. Citizen Arrested by Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government arrested a U.S. national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, U.S. Foreign Ministry services said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being “dangerous.”
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an ever-growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husbands are and is being followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a “soft” approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward with concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can return the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although these are new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
Detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press secretary with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States as the two countries begin to engage in better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly plotting to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan for the purpose of killing U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who scramble the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were led by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence representative who was briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east which became a haven for terrorism.
They were seen as undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to get entry into the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. secret service has had the priority of infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters act as gatekeepers, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
Analysts say potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also be increasingly careful, in recent years in choosing the people they accept as the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment pattern that so many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen demand ‘action’ for climate
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets here on Saturday, calling for more climate action from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the downtown area.
On this day when little has happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists have walked around the city, spreading signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, stating 'The Earth says it has had enough.'
Several celebrities joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s home country of Peru has opened her eyes to the heartbreaking issues facing the country due to the impact of climate change already occurring.
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to spread the word and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate talks, activists wearing black masks and clothing lit several explosives near the main canal in Copenhagen that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were throwing them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people gathered around television screens to follow the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems the protesters have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as China’s climate representative Su Wei.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "Actually, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then went on to say in Mandarin, "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful depending on the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or harm the freedom of others.”
Test results reveal tenacious race gaps
Last week’s federal report on math results brought good news to public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the lead establishments, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are making much greater progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the continuing gap between African-American and white outcomes, both locally and nationally.
Average white grade 4 (cm1) scores in Washington, D.C. have increased from 262 to 270 over the past two years (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The average result of the blanks was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overview over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the District's first NAEP report was released, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference only decreased to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by School Group Director Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) was propelled by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in District education.
I don’t jump for one or two points earned,” said Kwame R. Brown, a D.C. board member whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said the message from the test results is that the city’s middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what’s scary is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the end-of-school and early-school classes who did not incorporate the basics of reading earlier in their school journey and who are rather behind their peers.
Every day, the Mathematics program, for Kindergarten classes to Grade 6 (6th) emphasizes games and real-life experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who is also to be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to provide better interventions for these lower-level students, Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to elevate the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies city test results.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
This targeting can also have political repercussions that hamper this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they come from, are assured that their children will have excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that one of the essentials to narrowing the success gap was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with her teachers’ union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a “starting point” to get a further increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descends and blinks for a moment in the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
Super This is where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? said she, when she was shown the low ratio of law professor to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question isn’t whether you go to college:
The question is where.
Although this question still largely arises for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, “one in five second-generation Hispanics continues their high school education – a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they are paving the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study bouncers claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
There are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children in low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela’s university visit is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's oil ministry agrees with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq’s oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved out with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who had an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies were awarded contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The weak representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies have paved the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a news site on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday and political instability as U.S. military troops retreat, have held back U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the world’s third-largest crude reserves, analysts say.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The largest U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with and provided technical advice to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has bid more on contracts than other companies and left with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the oil ministry.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit bids made bids that were then compared to the barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile hit along the border with Afghanistan killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, U.S. counterintelligence officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched into their car on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan's anarchist tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a member of Pakistan’s civilian intelligence service said, speaking on Miran Shah’s phone.
Officials said suspicious local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the “completely shredded bodies.”
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terror representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the al-Qaida’s military organizers who led the group’s terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to stage conspiracies around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said that Somali had made rapid progress in al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general American public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official representative said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major al-Qaida figure or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has slowed since the summer, from about six operations a month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a nonprofit website.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul Withdraws
U.N. Special Envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday he would step down in March, at the end of a tumultuous term tainted by allegations of widespread corruption during U.N.-backed presidential elections.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the U.S. timetable for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign but would simply abide by his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it’s better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives say the name of Staffan di Mistura was cited; he is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and of concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations but said Galbraith's accusations - which was thanked - "harmed the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism about the international observation of the elections."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying it would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, saying heavy UN hiring regulations hampered his opportunities to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world’s major powers would soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a basement of 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, de-dramaticized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such a outcome.
One of the things that weighs on me most is that if I have learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable side of war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates said some of those sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said that a “set of motivations and punishments” could be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less secure with nuclear weapons” because “its people would suffer greatly” from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "likely" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment solely for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant part of his storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a means of building trust on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts at agreement – in part, experts say, because Iran’s leadership is divided over whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran’s stiffening up to some of the international community’s proposals they had actually agreed to in early October has pushed the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to come together on what they hadn’t considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set Dec. 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before it turns to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran’s mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls “baseless allegations” by certain members of the Security Council about Iran’s nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, “in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution.”
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late on Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the rich Kurdish oil region to meet with Troop Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
US officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In an ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda placards preaching to them, "Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An extra baby is an extra grave."
They learned the lesson so well that the Shanghai government authorities, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the aging population, radically changed their direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31, director of human resources and who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children notoriously unique with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the Shanghai resident population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of labor in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is to date, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy risk having to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and being discriminated against in the workplace.
Chinese authorities have given the police a duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the execution of this policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women with a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boys-girls ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time at all, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced with copies of regulations detailing who is entitled to have a second child and how to apply for leave.
The city government has dispatched family planners and volunteers to meet with couples at their homes and slide leaflets under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city in the suburbs of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and were legally allowed to have them.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
That's right, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she wanted only one child because she was a child herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us."
We’re not used to taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old translation company owner, says it more bluntly.
For middle-class couples who lower the birth rate, he says, one has to be selfish for success.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child demands a lot of time from their parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you have to write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for reducing emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- came back under fire on Friday, as a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations bolstering most of the burden, in the next 40 years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it illuminated the way forward.
But it has been seen as a major step forward in time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a UN task force, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, both on-going and long-term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what the upper limit of the global temperature rise would be that officials would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Sierra Club Representative in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN Executive Secretary-General on climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as “the full picture.”
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, vowing to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
U.S. Climate Negotiation Representative Todd Stern rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison to voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if these were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a sign that the Obama administration is getting tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from major developing countries, Stern said, adding that the text did not insist enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after China’s deputy foreign minister, He Yafei, said the U.S. chief negotiator either lacked “common sense” or was “extremely irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not financially help China fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing over their respective obligations as poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it was not surprising that major powers are fighting over who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold large emitters accountable for their actions.
It’s really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also a climate advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say the negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission’s climate unit, said small island states’ action has “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now unified and calling on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Debates have become an urgent matter, with delegates focusing on solving most of the pending problems before the heads of government reach an agreement.
Senior officials such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister got off their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend in-house meetings and news conferences, in order to be able to make claims that will be considered over the next week.
The real picture of the rally -- where 13,000 people walk in and out of the Palais des Congrès every day -- guitar-playing activists presenting nightly shows mocking countries that they think betray themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than via email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the greats, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
Heavy trucks are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday’s syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed commuter train will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Lost small holes will become thriving suburban towns, business travel times will be much shorter and moving from plane and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railroad, the inevitable scheduling battle, and fears of environmental hazards are likely to curb British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five meters of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment could be controversial.
In the countryside, the map will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go all the way to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
“It looks like it will be the best performance option,” said one rail professional.
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making it the fastest British network in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains 400m long and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on one route London - Birmingham.
A terminal capable of accommodating 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Experts in the rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if he launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to run off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, retaining travel times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a passage from planes to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Repay 75,000 GBP Loan for Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, a top Tory MP, has been charging the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orangery he built in his riding home.
The party official who was downgraded by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were “maintained” has increased his loan by 75,000 GBP to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been allowed to charge the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a check on members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his riding of Rutland - Melton.
The neighboring houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for fun".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into his pre-borrowing arrangements.
The Committee cleared him last month of any allegations of non-compliance after an investigation into his spending.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of borrowing GBP 271,406 from his London estate to his riding home, which he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
Documents released this week show Mr. Duncan was claiming about GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its demands increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were aimed at financing the loan of GBP 75,000.
The RBS variable standard interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then.
The most recent publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to ask for GBP 1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as the Phantom Cabinet Leader in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him stating that members of parliament had to survive “on budget” after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live 'on budget' and you're treated like 'on the street.'"
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small portion, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for a hell of a lot more, but I didn't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil trader, began having to explain his expenses in May after it emerged that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office on fees that this could be considered “excessive.”
An activist dug a hole in Mr Duncan’s lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had asked for 4,000 pounds for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: “There is no problem with stealing or drafting or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn’t be clearer or simpler.”
Faithful, come and see the Brighton Advent Calendar
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for each December day, using Christmas songs as their theme.
The event began on December 1, as visitors were allowed to visit the last booth, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., every day, with pâtés and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why are we waiting for people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
“The idea of the beach cabin Advent calendar came right after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner party.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to experience and represent that through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for climate change
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on tackling global warming, across the world and in Copenhagen, where police have carried out several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, tasked with reaching an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has helped to make the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
Incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the procession left, when a group of 300 protesters, dressed entirely in black, broke windows with stones and hammers, an AFP reporter said.
Immediately, riot police intervened.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the “Black Blocs”, these ultra-violent groups that had illustrated themselves in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the protest, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested “without distinction,” pointing out that about 100 of them “were still held in the street Saturday night “handcuffed and kept in a sitting position despite the extreme cold.”
Parliamentary party, the procession, rather good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, site of negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the intended speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of protesters had come by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoat, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the globalist movement has drawn closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of globalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, wearing bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters have also been held to call for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Abkhazia separatist elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first ballot after the Russo-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout was 58% a few hours before the closing, according to officials from the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates in the running, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili “regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia,” his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, 54-year-old historian Svetlana Kvartchia told AFP.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region with its sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Extensive signs showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to Russian officials who came to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said in a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one ceding control over the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current power or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: events in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police on the living arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that will have to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Party of Parliament, the parade, generally a good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage had been set up to welcome the intended speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred protesters, dressed entirely in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP journalist said.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened relentlessly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the “Black Blocs”, these ultra-violent groups that had illustrated themselves in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We keep an eye on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen had warned, as law enforcement helicopters circled the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by bus and train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoat, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are rivers where you can walk when you have never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the globalist movement has drawn closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of globalism, told AFP he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut-off between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters have also been held to demand action against climate change.

The geo-history comes out reinforced by the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD Sunday that history and geography came out "reinforced" by the reform of the general high school, despite the suppression of their compulsory education in scientific terminal.
Now, all first-graders will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "it is necessary to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "largely, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L sectors cannot remain sub-sectors of the S, he continues, stressing again: "neither have I heard many historians and intellectuals indignant about the absence of geography-history in terminal in technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L’Humanité found that nearly seven in ten French (69%) disapproved of the government’s plan to remove compulsory geography education in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The minister added, however, that it was "no question" to remove the philosophy of the S-terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also take internships during the M2 year and then be a first year ahead of the students as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, that is more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister says that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the project of removing the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on climate
15 minutes to talk about the issues at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Superior Normal School on Ulm Street, took up on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, each of fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist found.
We wanted to do something that caught people and made them want to know more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day, which takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
We select about twenty speakers from among the experts in their discipline and we select them for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "you can talk about hours, but you can also talk about the key objectives in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but with the help of graphs, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos from these conferences will be posted on the school’s website starting December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays in payments: Anger of prison overseers, planned actions
Prison watchdog unions on Friday called for “general mobilization” to demand overtime and overtime payouts to be paid by the end of the year for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiary (2nd union of overseers) has asked staff who will not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of the penitentiary establishments and to "block" them, to "report the theft of their dues".
The CGT-Penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming it "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "overtime, night, Sunday and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for the general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all of it has been budgeted, but assures that the rebates will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am not ignorant of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the prison management to put in place a set of measures without delay to ensure that this situation arises from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meager, except for the management staff benefiting from the famous awards of functions and objectives, lamented the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budget constraints have a good back".
This is a pure scandal, was outraged the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the money of the staff, believes the CGT-Penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less well-off than others.
But the account is not there, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Offers “Prettier Things” Than He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family in the White House, told the pope of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule when it comes to gifts: "I give things that are nicer than the ones I get."
As part of a special show that will air Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer insight into how they intend to celebrate the holiday season in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would have "of course" a gift, according to clips from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama signed up for falsehoods against her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Certainly not, I gave you cool gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before responding with humour by pointing his finger at the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you this?”
During this one-hour show, in the laid-back atmosphere, with the famous hostess who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama talked about a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my dad who came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
“I really didn’t know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse,” Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Claims He's in Artificial Coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to "significant injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the herniated disc suffered in Paris on November 26, his press service said in Paris, specifying that the injuries had "needed a restorative operation."
The singer's press service, however, was reassuring, saying the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be released no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, the singer's last tour partner, Johnny Hallyday was plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the condition of the patient when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drains would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for this herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the art world.
This one was not available on Thursday night to comment on the RTL information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, said Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass," but said he had "no worries" about the rocker, who is "a beater."
He had called me just before I left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because flying twelve hours after such an operation isn’t playable,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "smooth".
Mr. Camus also said he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer’s wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on a "small colon cancer", then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is abundantly commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulty of the singer to move on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet's premiere on his fetish distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medallist in the World Cup-2009 in the big pool, won an international title on Thursday over a distance he particularly loves, the 50 m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 in the small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while we were expecting a surge.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relay gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who stood on the world record of the 50 m free, of which he holds the brand in the big basin (20.94).
On one of the two swimming distances, the 50 m free, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the global brand (20.30) as he had envisioned.
You can always dream better and in this case, I had said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
Originally set to 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, in the same competition.
This time the use of the suits did not serve the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big basin this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower the mark that he holds on 400 m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t get into this race.
I knew I couldn’t break a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann said.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola adjudged 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged to French writer Emile Zola was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, significantly above his estimate, art dealer Sotheby's said.
This front panel, two meters long and 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and baccatons, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, Sotheby's vice president of art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bathtub in his Parisian mansion, and in Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
It remained a shadowy area for about fifty years.
While searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's Abortion Attempt to Leave Honduras for Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe conduct by the coup government.
At the moment, after a phone conversation overnight with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for achieving this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane has returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The coup government wanted to force Zelaya to “resign” and seek political asylum abroad to grant him safe conduct.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a visiting acting head of state.
The coup government “had yet another failure to want me to step down ... they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, where he has often spoken since the start of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing some chords the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday.
I do not ask any country for asylum, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be made as president of the Honduran people, he said.
Zelaya's departure rumors had mobilized supporters of the fallen president on Wednesday, who came to rally around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the position of the coup government.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had drawn close to Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21 and took refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" that the coup government accuses of.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Zelaya’s return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with the U.S. trade balance figures reflecting the recovery in activity of both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technology-dominant Nasdaq by 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index scored 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
There is good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But that remains anecdotal, she tempered, saying the market was focused on “half-full glass.”
Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, said investors focused on the U.S. trade balance figures, “showing that business is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell in October by 7.6 percent from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expecting an increase in the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly for exports of goods, which reflects the growth in the economies of the major U.S. trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
By contrast, new unemployment enrollments in the United States rose against all expectations last week to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “has fallen to the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night and the 30-year yield to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of Power Supporters Conspire to “Ladies in White”
A few hundred supporters of Cuban power on Thursday conspired with the wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Some forty "Ladies in White", wives or close friends of political prisoners, were seen on the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist found.
Downstairs the Yankees, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, with a raised fist, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
They were escorted by civilian agents who came to “ensure their protection.”
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the “Ladies in White” in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, about ten dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were arrested by police officers in civilian clothes, an AFP reporter said.
Police forcibly loaded dissidents into civilian vehicles that were seized by government supporters, according to the reporter.
Detentions of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda was among the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remained under lockdown.
Cuban authorities regard opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” on the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported Thursday’s demonstration of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced man kills 80-year-old with knife and injures 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A gunman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old and wounded five others in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne, Hauts-de-Seine, an hour into the crowd, on Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the assailant, 28 years old, allegedly struck with two knives and for reasons indeterminate, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, was learned from police sources and witnesses.
Severely injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to an officer of the Alliance police union, died in the hospital from his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured person’s days are at risk, with vital organs apparently affected, police sources said.
The pregnant woman then became unwell and was reportedly hospitalized “in shock,” according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He allegedly injured two passersby, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter seriously.
The script was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher’s knives that he carried cross-behind his back, said an Alliance union official in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, according to AFP testimonies, have tried to control the forcible.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn’t make it because the guy was heavy, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at 61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with punches, according to police sources.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers-by came to tell me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old on the floor, put him in a safe position, and saw a very important wound in the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later a second person in his thirties arrived, injured by a knife.
National police officers arrested the man without identity papers.
The prosecutor's office of Nanterre seized the investigation from the departmental judicial police department of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out his being interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitement" like "all the forces of this species whose forces are doubling under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for cessation of prosecutions
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of the lawsuit against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland on a more than 30-year-old case.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the "Pianist," denounced three judges of the appeals court of the second district of California for serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
I am calling for the dismissal of charges here and now, Hummel said, before adding that the behavior of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, was "cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since passed away -- reportedly discussed, before handing down his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to be imprisoned -- which is a serious misconduct.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared in late September that he had "lies" to the author of the documentary.
In case the court refused to drop the lawsuit, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski appeared in court.
The 76-year-old had fled the United States in 1978, before his sentencing, for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old girl.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney General Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be there to appear at the hearing.”
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker “asks for a favor in court, while despising his authority.”
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed "that there were other alternatives to running away."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to call for the dismissal of Roman Polanski's lawsuit.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also demanded, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client can no longer stand being harassed at every turn of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends up directionless, held back by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market pulled between better-than-expected indicators in the US and the dollar’s rise: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery," Charles Schwab analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also recovered sharply in December, at 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary index estimate.
Indices, however, have been curbed by a further rise in the dollar, at a two-month high against the euro, which “pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology values have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3,540 percent from 3,482 percent on Wednesday night and the 30-year yield to 4,497 percent from 4,492 percent the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of traveling through South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are preparing to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great beauty mass held for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sports or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I’ve seen so many things and lived so many experiences!” exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, underlines Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second trip to South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of which have become Bollywood stars.
It’s every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
“We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown,” says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will march in traditional costume and of course in swimsuit.
The show will be hosted by a Chinese TV presenter, Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a head of the Miss World committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it welcomes the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates did as last year a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will no doubt remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been dating people I never thought I could get close to.
I will definitely be back for the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news 'very positive', says son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," his son David assured Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he was due to go to his father's bedside hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane that was taking him from Paris shortly after local 13:00 (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, looking relaxed, said he would travel "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following a herniated disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "put in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Hallyday had previously been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following a herniated disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is educated to attend a school show, an AFP photographer said.
Yves Catoné, head of orthopaedic and trauma surgery at Pity-Salpêtrière Hospital, said he would visit the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
I’ve heard of a possible legal process ahead, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was "leaving much too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it stunned me, given that I had two disc hernias myself, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "going without drain, without anything" after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to relieve a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, repeatedly convicted by the courts, in cases of medical liability, as well as for tax fraud and scams.
Mr Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He said the intervention was "perfectly well conducted" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a restart of the tour on January 8 as planned seems very short, Camus said.
The association UDF raises the tone and sums up the New Center to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the APO attempt of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, under the acronym of the former Giscardian party, urging him to no longer use it on any support, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, saying that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (former UMP past the NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF trademark for having been the first to file it in 2004 with the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to be dispossessed, came out of its silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and the deputy, adding that they should no longer use the acronym and pass on ownership of the brand to them, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you will propose to your political movement to +take over + the acronym UDF, the association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it was good to have the name of this movement, the +New Center+, the +UDF slogan of today+, on your militant material and on the page of your site guard, also confirmed by the signatories of the mail.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the office of the UDF which calls on the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as (its) website".
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to pass on the ownership of (the) trademark to its legitimate beneficiaries".
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends had "choose" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office charged with defending "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of the acronym UDF to do so on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing about the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that one is not entitled to."
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier to be tried for weakness abuse
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to try artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as billionaire Liliane Bettencourt’s daughter accuses him, he took advantage of an octogenarian state of weakness to rob her of part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star pictures, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for weakness abuse, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a €375,000 fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such a review, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010 stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt was in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she will submit to it.
I will talk to her about it, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, said at the hearing.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Mr Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who needs to be protected, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has prosecuted François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who she accuses of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or masterboards.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court was to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleas sometimes turned to the big family unpacking on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer referred to three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
For her part, the Nanterre prosecutor's office again considered that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge has refused in recent days to grant her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to take legal action, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place,” said prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
The Management Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been unsuccessful.
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it was once, to impose on consumers products thought by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the business, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets back in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the factors of customer preferences returns regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "demands from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that the revenues of authoritarian management totally contradict.
That’s why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the center of the company’s concerns in the same way as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incite this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- Firstly because I have been able to see that, faced with a new situation, any structure finally manages, after many detours, to do first... what it has always done.!
Second, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of one’s own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Coming from major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, out of intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US “neurosciences” and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by study institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the “levers” (sic) of executive engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr comforts leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies requires a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or governance practice, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to achieve some of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from Motivational Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resource management back “in place.”
In this way, they create a favourable terrain for the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: ‘Just War’ Brings Right Praise to Obama
The U.S. right on Friday welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo yesterday, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had broached the award on Oct. 9, applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Mrs. Palin, an aegis of the right wing of the Republican party, to the USA Today daily, adding that she herself addressed the "sometimes necessary" theme of war in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is of course the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “a very good job” in Oslo.
I found the speech to be really good, said the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On some sides, I found this speech entirely historic, Mr. Gingrich said, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former president, considered by some to be a possible Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush pen converted columnist in the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world” as “he always does,” “he has spoken like an American president,” reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they are not doing much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "bitter, blistered and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the president’s left, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we wrap war in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained applauded for the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech “super-production” even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the newspaper said.
Obama "made the right speech," The New York Times said, calling him "both dark and uplifting."
Roads: Three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organization to have stayed until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" in this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of talks, the negotiators left early on Friday, hoping to quickly sign the text of the agreement in the late morning.
And this even if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting that began at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "it was feared that it would disrupt the holiday season," Bussereau said.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In the hourly rate, for low wages, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It’s not much, but we leave very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
We are going to give orders to our militants that there be no blockades, no blockades of the supply centers.
But we can still have some recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, praised "a good deal", although it was "difficult to concede increases on high salaries given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to it as an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel costs by 3%, and the maintenance of general road transport status in the first half of 2010, which will notably address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of 100 million euros in employers' charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the amending financial bill for 2009, voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it “on the same terms.”
TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply first to companies that are members of this organization, and secondly to the entire profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a “market of dupes”, as the 100 million euros “had already been promised to the sector to offset a part of the carbon tax”.
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year, lamented Unostra.
For the other, the agreement risks "to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
Disruptions on the RER A, France’s largest urban transit line, will continue over the weekend, as a Friday meeting on the 2nd day of strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry for their premium demand.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10:00 and 20:00, at the rate of one train in two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train in four outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, requiring passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that "RATP is making efforts to serve department stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated during peak hours, and almost no trains at peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no rush on the docks, as the Francilians had organized themselves.
In the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially due to the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen “an hour and a half before, to make sure he arrived on time.”
Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, said the SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of officers and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged “magnificent” by the unions, of a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The ERN Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the ERN A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, indignant the CGT, underlining that the management "was not screwed up to solve a problem while at the truckers and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions of exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
This also made the unions say that the company was "laughing at weekend users".
By the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a settlement committee at the Paris headquarters.
It was then that the management, who until then had refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "for the sake of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, after a notice was filed by Unsa and Independents.
The unions demand a bonus of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line per million daily travelers.
The drivers of RER, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for off-times, on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish judiciary dissolves pro-Kurdish party with heavy consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a “home to activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk's parliamentary immunity and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party says it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to quell Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had said a dissolution could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolien, where many protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have escalated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice was announced, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast mostly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
A hundred people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deepen the despair.”
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning a party, he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This solves nothing, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the road clearance and sandblasting service (FES) makes it clear that this is not to annoy citizens.
It is simply so that the agents can test the technique of the vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the meteorologists, it may well be for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle snow and ice.
The EDF here follows a very elaborate plan.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow on the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles run 20 main routes (so-called A routes).
This includes the busy streets, the main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as Atzelbergstraße are also included.
EDF officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of road must be salted with a road foundation that adheres well, in 3 hours of maximum time.
This is why the EDF service starts at 3 a.m. "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic begins".
This is where it gets more difficult when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, the head of the road clearance and sandblasting service tells us "because no motorist is willing to let salty vehicles through".
Then, if it doesn't snow anymore, we take care of access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Side lanes and side streets come last.
Mr. Braubburger knows that this always causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the EDF's walking team sets out to clear out areas deemed hazardous and crossings as a matter of priority.
As for the bike paths, the EDF services are generally unable to take care of them.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4.30 a.m.
As ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service in case of need.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hahae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long by 1.50 meters high, its posterior limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would not have been exceptional.
But, as reported by Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s Science magazine, the Tawa hahae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the supercontinent's landmass, the Pangaea, and was toward the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of Tawa lights up the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the kinship ties, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team tells that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
Excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indian word for sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontologists share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular, but he points out that it confirms some theories regarding the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the earliest dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the Saurians divided into three major evolutionary groups: theropods (carnivores) which include the later appeared tyrannosaurus and velociraptor and from which descend birds, sauropods, long-necked quadrupeds, and those related to them and ornithischian herbivores such as ornithischian species.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa was one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting ratio of features that are both primitive and developed, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found evidence to suggest that the Tawa hahae possessed small air bags in its skull-level bones, as do the birds that are the descendants of theropods.
These small pockets of air make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hahae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air bags in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the huge sauropods also possessed air bags and a light skeleton, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that Saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. the entire landmass that formed the supercontinent Pangaea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to him.
All three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the Natural History Museum of New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the sileosaur, that lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
How dinosaurs became the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, however, remains a mystery to this day.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and many other Saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread across the planet thus promoting the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such a success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction to which the dinosaurs randomly survived while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favorsthe flourishing of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and since that time has been in the shadows: it was mammals.
Solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the J.W. Goethe University casino in Frankfurt is making waves all over the world.
278 professors from J.W. Goethe University and other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students of Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police requested by the university's steering committee.
Last week, University President Werner Müller-Estler evacuated buildings occupied by striking students and teachers after walls and artwork were smeared with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories believe that the degradations did not justify "such a violent intervention on the part of the police commando against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable violation" of freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to “delegitimize and criminalize protest” and tries to forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The University's Steering Committee thus avoided the debates that would be indispensable.
Court officials demand that criminal proceedings be immediately suspended.
The majority of occupants did not participate in the damage.
Legitimation of protests
The youth of the Verdi union of the services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are just a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
As for Hesse Minister of Sciences Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the site is totally unacceptable, she told the regional parliament in Wiesbaden last Thursday on the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU Member of Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
SPD opposition parliamentary groups, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the students’ arguments and demands, they are being evacuated.
The Left Party tabled a motion urging the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new “Silicon-valley”
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weapons, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the town has the reputation of being the Soviet “Silicon Valley”.
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As early as September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, the location of the Frankfurt sciences – with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives from Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “Protocol of Close Collaboration”.
The signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, project section head for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
There are the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be high enough.
For its supporters it is nothing less than the “new heart of Europe”.
If you will. S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
Head-of-the-line stations, with lanes that ended in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of 19th century transport technology that acted as the brake pad of modern rail traffic because it once took a long time to pass the locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you have to do.
That is why head-of-line stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Magistral Railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realisation of the S21 project is really going to start, although the visions of the 80s have not been compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, head-of-line stations no longer pose real entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with autorails and pilot cars at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new layout of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have won.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who bears the risk costs of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public company.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphs of the computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of people that was attributed - and this is typical of the 80s - a huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than truck transport on the road.
But the new layout, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhine Valley by 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press here thoroughly on the fungus.
But the S21 project looks like a braking shoe.
The Rhine Valley route is on track to become the bottleneck for international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
Government Examines Judgment Regarding Airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government raised the possibility of appealing the Hessian Administrative Court's ruling on the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to review the ruling of the Administrative Tribunal from a legal point of view, which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Court of Cassation had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event that the project of construction of the north-west landing strip at Frankfurt Airport would be carried out.
The permit to land for 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisioned by the state government, is not compatible with citizens’ legal protection against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 if it wishes to appeal against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises the delay and tries to pressure the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel calls on the CDU and the FDP to return to their pre-election promise to ban night flights, otherwise it will be considered a total breach of a given word.
It’s damn hard to be allowed to keep his word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch refutes the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel that the Land government is still trying to authorize night flights using "lawyers and robbers".
It takes time to conduct a precise legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a “quick first impression”.
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of the faction's statements on the prohibition of night flights is completely flawed.
U.S. banks repay aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, are getting rid of their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
CNBC said in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers as well as the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The remainder of the sum comes from the bank's coffers which are well filled thanks to the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the Managing Director of the Bank of America, specifically wanted to thank American taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had presumed its capabilities by buying investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup is also planning to procure money in the financial markets in order to free itself from state oversight.
The U.S. bank could launch a capital increase of $20 billion on Thursday, CNBC reported, citing banking circles.
The Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated Election
In the end, it all happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German chain ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin editorial board of ZDF, was the big favorite.
However, the channel did not wish to officially confirm the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further harm the ZDF intendant Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had declared themselves in favour of Brender's renewal and 7 others had voted against. Brender's removal by vote represented a slight but foreseeable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is the majority on the Board of Directors, had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to return Brender to his position.
Roland Koch, the Hessian Minister-President, organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor, citing the fact that the rate of listening to ZDF news broadcasts had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, tormenting the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had meddled in the debate and who felt that Koch’s actions were unconstitutional.
But it will not help.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance (Spanish) languages.
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Radio organ of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily newspaper of national scope).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF, first of all in the news magazine "haute-journal" (today's newspaper).
From 1988 to 1990 he was deputy editor-in-chief of the ZDF; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (a bimonthly news show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the ZDF's foreign policy department and then head of the Berlin editorial board.
After the disgrace of Brender, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch’s opponent in the Board of Directors, Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF’s Intergovernmental Treaty so that the steward’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to ask for the withdrawal of political figures who are members of the ZDF's oversight committees.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender, had skillfully maneuvered with the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to fire Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for the students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was drawn up stipulating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of examinations: a single examination should allow the chosen study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will need to be redesigned to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed to more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master courses.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulations from one Land to another.
Fewer exams
Since the start of the student protests last June, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and university rectors have constantly spoken of the fashionable phrase: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The accreditation board decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", reads a 30-page document on future requirements for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, we should be able to stop the slippages, which significantly harmed the studyability.
In addition, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if we can not avoid this feeling of suffocation that is sometimes felt in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge about Kunduz, the opposition believes Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and room to allow and foster personal initiative."
The new regulations will cover access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles need to be "re-accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is not until 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation councils set up by the Länder.
In October, the Education Ministers had put some pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes were not overloaded and the examination regime not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
Rhineland-Palatinate is the only country to have agreed so far to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs and strengthen pedagogical guidance offices as well as examination offices and the international relations department.
The Länder and universities have a budget of 10 million euros.
In early 2010, the government wanted to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one exam will be required to complete his studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, moreover, the recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions must be guaranteed and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the question of the conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has indicated that he would like to see the organization of educational policy no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
No later than after the educational strike, students as concerned should be able to express themselves a little.
Future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of the students is very useful to us" she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a common reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder provide the Bachelor students of today, that tomorrow there will be enough places for Master's studies and the best possible study conditions.
The Länder therefore need to hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master.
More than a note at the bottom of Herta Müller
It is with these words “Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control...” that a work by the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in snippets of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later a collector’s director in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessian literary forum at the Mousonturm artist's house in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of mention of himself in non-literary circles last Tuesday at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow German-Romanian writers Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
In 1989, Söllner was awarded the German language prize jointly with some of the participants.
Enlistment tests had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, "so someone who has not been able to withstand the intimidation attempts of the Securitate".
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary entanglements with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and lowliness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, to the best of our knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He was able to get it out of all the tough situations at the time,” Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written in July in the newspaper “Die Zeit”, after reading the 914 pages of its own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have speculated and sometimes guessed which real names were hidden last, the borrowing names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike in Germany, where consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
Systematic clarification has been consistently thwarted and curbed in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS), but the return of the files has rather been delayed since then.
Since 2005 there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and she was interviewed only once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Admittedly, many inevitable questions are associated with the Söllner case as it so often occurs in a context of hidden guilt.
The weighty reaction of the listeners, according to Söllner, suggests that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Troubles in the Champions League
It felt like a representative was coming in, four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his merchandise when the new VFB coach Christian Gross climbed at midnight less than a quarter in a Mercedes C-Class, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, allowed himself to be led into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he hadn’t drunk alcohol and he wasn’t drunk with happiness either.
It was a nice evening, but we had to get back to work tomorrow.
Because now it was going to start.
The words of the Swiss who had just started three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back".
The "big job" awaits us on Sunday.
Here it is a question of repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three expeditious goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing
The eighth round of the Champions League (game round 16./17. + 23./24 February/ return match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's fulminant entry into office was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only in the lucky one, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be braver, explained the "soul plumbing" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good but no longer worked with the healer Babbel.
He has unleashed a certain magic, admitted Jens Lehmann - Babbel supporter - "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes things happen that we would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of pause for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the method of work of the new boss: "He is someone who goes into action and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warns manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart mainly needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won at Glasgow before having a bad awakening at Leverkusen four days later with the 0:4, objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had indeed achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We have not yet crossed the difficult path.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday doesn't have the heart to celebrate, even after his first home win in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann bounced back just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, would counter Heldt, in response to Lehmann’s bitter criticism.
He had accused management of style weakness and said she had decided to change coaches under pressure from pubertal fans.
Lehmann had also judged it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the games had been removed from him.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked with a pure selfishness” brought Heldt down and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked becoming friends for life these two forty-year-olds.
In all cast, they agreed for everything else, that is, without the group's prior work by the replaced coach, strong sporting and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “largely successful,” said Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the man with the plastic bag acquiesced.
World Heavyweight Championship
Warm combat in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly challenged world champion Vitali Klitschko verbally and gestically.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
He was unanimous in his judges' points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his World Heavyweight Championship title.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory in the judges' uniminity points against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has been honorably defending her title since her comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had twice won the World Championship of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional matches, had to admit twice his loss because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mainly wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his left.
Johnson, 11 centimetres smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from getting his dangerous right back into the game.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, to have passed with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko by calling him a “bad zombie” who “isn’t really capable.”
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion couldn’t help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose “so he could see his eyes.”
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a hit in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said, explaining his quick return to the ring.
His goal is to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it was the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye canceled a game against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is now planning to have this match played at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defense Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affair.
The parties SPD and La Gauche (die Linke) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately covering up certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a falsehood" about the deadly strike on two tanker trucks last September, Greens parliamentary group leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in complete disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, in essence, the content of the report that NATO has at its disposal and that was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the aim of the strike was not in reality to destroy the stolen trucks, but rather to eliminate two major Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigative report, 142 people were killed or injured in the US airstrike that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and her Green party colleague Renate Künast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal government’s Afghan policy, and whether the Chancellery, army and intelligence services have endorsed this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancery has in no way influenced the army’s interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing louder to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to SPIEGEL, the information they had given Guttenberg about the tanker attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and concealed some embarrassing details from the Minister.
In the entourage of the two senior officials, however, it is suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert has in the meantime asked in a letter for a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the Department declined to comment on these allegations and referred them to the Federal Parliament’s commission of inquiry that was to be formed the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality merge.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can indulge in the wildest dreams and fantasies without hindrance.
However, one who, awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at issue: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but which sometimes pushes the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, at best it is called visions, at worst madness.
But even though the trigger and effect stand out, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitting substances of the brain - first of all dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks down and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earth's force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreams.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It’s autumn 2001 when Henning T transforms into a comic book character.
Its body is in two dimensions with creepy colors.
Earth's attraction no longer has power over it, it hovers at the edge of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him winged devil creatures, grinding, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Toning, mean voices, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of his stereo chain, makes it a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and loops around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop comes off.
Let it serve as a lesson, shout the voices in a choir to tear his eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get cured!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, those affected can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they find themselves in a state of hyper arousal, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, Head of the Department of Psychiatry at the Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenia is at the very center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenia often feels threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility of adjusting reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience once in your life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved.”
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the lived takes place in a real setting.
Why our brain makes these kinds of cabriolets, is always a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to momentarily lose their perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the people involved have minor brain damage.
It is assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the neuronal system occurs and moreover the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains are warming.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been compiling reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The unreal world in our heads".
Hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, love sorrows or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admit to having experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to high school.
A normal girl, really.
If there were no images and voices.
During the playtime, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long chestnut hair, speaks to him.
When she answers, her classmates look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, she is sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even sense his presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young man nice.
Am I crazy?, she asks sometimes.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are usually frightening.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to take the course because the teacher is just introducing a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the board.
At night the apparitions are usually frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that comes too rarely and too late, she can often make no distinction whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grinding faces or the girl with bloody notches on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she yells at these creatures.
She doesn't tell her parents or her friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She got her bachelor's degree last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she got in touch with psychologist Kasten online she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the likelihood is high that they will have hallucinations after a while.
I guess because the brain isn't busy enough, it makes sure there's animation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was of age to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for actual impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, nighttime dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations in healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That’s why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between dreaming and hallucination.
Unfortunately, in our overly conscious world, we quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called onyroid form of experience, a particular form of the modification of consciousness awakened by dreaming.
The dream experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is in a state of awakening.
The onyroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious and experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dreaming and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, a capacity of organization that is given to us men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his dreamlike experiences in his book "Change of heart" as an action to safeguard the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious goes on a journey several days after a heart valve operation followed by a transplant; meanwhile, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from all quarters, visiting foreign places, traveling through time. He sees himself as an old man lying in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He absorbs himself completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally distinguished from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes, describing what he has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and intensive than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, dreamlike delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
Kallen’s appointment to the position of CEO of the Burda publishing houses is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain a 100% family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly committed to joining society, Hubert Burda, 69, told the Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
We will also have to see if they are capable.
We cannot impose our children on 7500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the position of Chief Executive Officer as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he took care of the treasury sector i.e. he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took charge of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus for the first time it is not a member of the family who is the head of the Burda editions.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17, respectively, and his son Felix, who is now 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves as the link for the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda states that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
Ruins have always taken place in families who have let themselves be carried away by a bulimia of capital, who have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I have never had a dream of universal power, said Burda.
I don't see myself at all in the role of the country's tutor as Springer could be and I don't intend to be part of such international leagues as Time, these companies have taken on far too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés seems to have set itself, which has just opened in the Callao (Madrid) shopping centre, a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, is home to prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food rack, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different types.
Spaxion offers among other things to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual “trainers” that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its manager ensures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after having our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various necklaces
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, get the electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, has created the “Oficina LIVE”.
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting electric vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The "Officio LIVE" (Logistics for the Implantation of Electric Vehicles) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implantation of the electric car in the city and will put in place agreements on mobility, carrying out procedures, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the implementation of the electric car.
The electrical company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote Research and Technological Development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in European-wide standardisation groups and has a range of complementary projects underway such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a future of tranquility” for the engine industry
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, envisions "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production sites," he said.
“Through this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can look to a quiet future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), allocated 800 million euros to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended for both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of classic cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Motor Show, a meeting place for professionals and motor enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
They have an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can we find motorcycles and vintage cars, but we will also find at ClassicAuto Madrid items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, at the pavilion exhibitors, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collectible engine that will delight collectors and curious people.
Participating companies include Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, automotive sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, automotive sales and catering, or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Ability test outdoors
But the trade show will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit set up outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sporting spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sporting spirit is not upset with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, is only available on the 2.0 gasoline engine of 150 horsepower.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good grade it obtained as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver’s seat, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large chest with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-litre, 150-horsepower petrol engine and with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a real happiness. It is distinguished by its finesse, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most demanded Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, in other words the one with the largest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipment, the lane change assistant (RVM) that removes dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio especially, as well as the remarkable wheels.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes among other elements the bi-xenon adaptive headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behavior and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150 horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
"First" Luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
Stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as they are sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady".
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to watch his email, without offering the possibility of even seeing certain types of attachments or surfing the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, which is less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is as limited as his American grandfather, but comes with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult its mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it’s been working for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The European Commission’s repeated calls for affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside of his home country, we're hesitant to use the data, and we're not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it’s always curious that it’s called Fon when it doesn’t have Wi-Fi) offers these types of rates, means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no galley.
It is a connected device and you pay when you buy it and not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a lifetime purchase option like Peek already offers in the US.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
While she went to the presidency of Barack Obama with a dress and a coat of this color, she chose the same to accompany her in the second moment, without a doubt, the most important of her life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So much so that at first glance, it seems that the first lady of the United States follows in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to give back the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the take-over it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she was wearing a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heel for the first time, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now lifted while she was wearing it the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed in the study "Fructivity and professional career of women in Spain", carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their careers limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether or not the woman works, and the type of employment occupied.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have a poorly stable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are reluctant to enter the couple's life and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after moving in as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable job have needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to push back the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the start date of common life,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the age gap between women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those who attended elementary and higher education were first mothers at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
“Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary school get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child,” says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is well worth it too.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several of the brand’s products, singing the universal motto “Because I’m worth it”.
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered with L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline’s companion in Lost).
British Fashion Prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
The Poker of Aces by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither fear nor enlightenment.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
Here are some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: “In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same one that I felt without naming: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.”
“Nihilistic, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between helplessness and ignorance, with dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of a knife that almost killed him.”
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion which lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which consisted in reaching heaven by the way of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed from the north face, on which the best climbers still and always let go."
William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a county landowner and at other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were grandiose.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer gathered the insane cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the maggots."
On Dorothy Parker: “One day she got on her knees and prayed, ‘Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.’
On his grave were engraved Spenser's verses: "Sleep after effort, / after storm wear, / rest after war, / after life, tired death delights."
On Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband would normally agree to her telling her that Edward VII was spying on her among the Azalees or that the birds were singing in Greek.
You have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent surpassed madness.
On Pío Baroja: “What did Martín-Santos do but try to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What would Benet try but to have Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did this do but to aspire to the glory of this man, that he might serve him as a pedestal?”
A Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a blood-mele, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they laid two kicks on her that left the dog severely injured.
Our indignation is immense because we don’t see what’s fun about attacking a defenseless little animal that, in addition, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and, when she insulted these individuals, managed to fear for her physical integrity, since an energizer who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been groaning all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint at the police station of the neighbourhood, even if we doubt that it serves a great deal and to avoid touching the sensibilities, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Indignation led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s going on with young people so that they find it fun to abuse for free a defenseless animal that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where the right education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, helmet wear sets
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only protection element to avoid head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin said that this campaign is in line with its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of increasingly safe products” and affirmed that it contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new two-wheel helmet promotion campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure their widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are on the rise
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of the dealers.
However, the good news needs to be nuanced, since the reference used for comparison in November 2008 was particularly poor, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the upturn last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add up all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The large clouds that affect their demand the most have not disappeared, because, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases thanks to external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of bank credits, other factors must be added, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Faced with this situation and the difference between passenger vehicles, the 2000E's purchase aid has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, freelancers and SMEs who wish to purchase a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealer association expects a year 2010 similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As was the case with the anti-lock ABS brake system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and newly registered light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a deficiencies period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its mode of action, it can also contribute to avoiding many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident were unable to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken full advantage of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, revanche, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one in four disasters with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to finalize the plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each item of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
At GM, however, it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the bid for Dutch sports car maker Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, is gaining prominence.
In case there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to slim it down by just under 80 kilograms, leaving the scale at just 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual covered roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos of gains, to mount sports with another 12 kilos of heavy tyres.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining six more kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK gearbox, the test was performed on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on California secondary network roads in the mountains, with particularly twisty turns.
His behavior can only be described as irreproachable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from riding on the ground with plumbing.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in corners, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for the necessary time, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands on the wheel will indicate.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Sound of an engine at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the engine noise, already used on the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, whether at a standstill or during recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The cladding of the roads that we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed well the hen’s nests.
The electronic assistants barely acted of presence throughout the journey, while on some bends we found ice in the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-lightweight car, the most entertaining to drive and that is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
An intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Cocoon line and occasional starlette of the house’s parades, the singer displays her face as a bad girl with as much restraint as her Chanel bags.
More than a “Bad Girl” or a “It Girl,” it’s a “Bag Girl.”
Baskonia wins in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a resounding triumph in 91-82 during her visit to the arduous field of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. She thus leads his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets three points was the best of his team (29 rating).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter hinted that they had jumped on Israeli ground with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main craftsmen of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barak's inner play and Eliahu's work, which was received by cheers and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "minus six" rating already hinted that night wasn't going to be the Brazilian's best.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the team of Avala wanted to remind the one of Vitoria that we do not win so easily on their field, and thanks to "the hand of Elias", they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellows taking the lead over the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed to string together a few skillful actions to catch the air, and it was at this point that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged, with three three-pointers in a row and the help of English and Ribas handed the third-placed score to a reassuring 54-67.
Avala's team went out to play it all for the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not let anyone take what they deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign themselves and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost noisily in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the head of Group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship or by the size of the rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream, an aggressive defense and three three-pointers in a row, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the indoor game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a beginning of fight, between the North American leaders of the two players Beverley and Williamsqual.
The Greek team began to operate by showing their superiority on both sides, while the exit for injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
Indoor players and Lithuanian wingman Linas Kleizas, with their three-pointed baskets, dug the 44-32 lead in the nineteenth minute.
An Impossible Rise
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match played at Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, causing the head of the group to waver.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to his organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was virtually impossible because Olympiacos proved relentless when players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you get paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of real estate, jobs and vehicles ads in Spain.
The “How much should you be paid?” tool calculates user salaries from more than 140,000 jobs available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you need to enter your profession, years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week now, the search engine has detected that the Spanish worker is generally “feeling poorly paid,” said Albert Ribera, head of products at Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovita from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross yearly and a French one, 31,059, while a Spaniard receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net annual, followed by that of seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are as a driver, part-time and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president must abandon the diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, the head of the Brazilian embassy in Honduras’ capital, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he must look for another destination."
The channel also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant rating in the markets, uncertainty resurfaces, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future of an uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been practically finalized and, without questioning their non-conforming liquidity policy, are starting to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB did, with their one-year auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond gaps are rising again, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was once again affected.
There is again a rush towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad at silencing the advocates of moral risk, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those in charge of world economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of the credit limitation on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai looks like a tribal struggle between emirs to restore their place of power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pot.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for the ECOFIN to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a member country of the euro area not to meet its commitments.
On the other hand, what makes sense is that the ECOFIN has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gaps increase to the extent of European corporate bonds, we do not have to worry.
If the European gaps were to decrease and ours were to continue to increase, then it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor’s case is an anecdote: when our forecasting indicators force most survey services to anticipate their stimulus patterns and revise their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which are returning to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not augur much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems like a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment “caution is the mother of security”.
Connected Sectors
Iberdrola’s president, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, eight-closed.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros by 2020 and 60,000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that the nuclear power plants currently in operation remain open.
If this were not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Starting in 2020, the issue is changing, and power will need to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with mechanisms for recovering carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, he considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, along with other "supportive energies".
Galán, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Bill that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is calling for, did not want to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to fight against global warming.
According to him, there is “a clear long-term bet” in this regard, despite the “point-to-point” measures, as the president of Iberdrola has called them.
In any event, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time to reach maturity and a stable paying framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will act as the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at 10 European airports where it operates.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance plans an investment of 20 million euros until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on highways and airports.
Acciona races its first Australian highway in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The tunnel at stake is an estimated 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway concessionaire.
The city council hopes to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing Public/Private Collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortiums are competing, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only smooth Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest manufacturers, while the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh public works company, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major yards and privatizations, but entering is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the already mentioned Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just gained a foothold in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, in which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the business group responsible for building and managing the Adelaide desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and leverage the synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Bureau and the Northern Link, is intended to connect the Toowong West Highway to the Kelvin Grove Peripheral Road (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel, and is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place in the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open for traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist twice of two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers a job in Hochtief
Australia continues to make much of Hochtief, which yesterday mentioned getting a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The ACS-owned company will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fibre-optic broadband network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have fast access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company sold the 27-story King George Tower project in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O’Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million euros
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia, for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The company was awarded this contract a few days after being responsible for the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria, for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Ms. Rushmore is awarded Renfe’s advertisement
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that submitted to the tender organized by Renfe, among which four were finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Telecom fined $63 million to curb competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Telecom €63 million for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programs on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state enterprise, accumulates more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
An App Store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile subsidiary followed in the footsteps of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will take until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its inception.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth position of the clubs that pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
Indeed, the competition allocated €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to earn the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And this, even though they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of the money brought by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution:
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA's complex procedure for allocating money.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (among which Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the final eighths receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarterfinals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least $7.1 million, and a maximum of $31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four assigned places.
The previous year's champion pockets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the share purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public offering of acquisition (POA) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
Jerez’s group gives shareholders a 15-day deadline to indicate their interest in selling the securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If it happened, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible buyouts and the legal back and forth of her former directors, the Jesús brothers and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal further misappropriations of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, the former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes the Paternina Exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paterina on October 9th.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet submitted "sufficient" following the amendments applied on December 2.
The CNMV clarified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paterina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the share capital, composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
He further explained that 5 592 778 million shares were immobilized, and that they could not in any way be transmitted before the finalization of the offer, of which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of the repair.
Each claim is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a lengthy and complex task.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult job, because you have to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and record its price.
In addition, an "intelligent" graphic image of each model is created, on which the different parts of a passenger car can be clicked.
If it is a model sold massively, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in use, the figure is over 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most common application is for repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of breakage parts or to calculate the sales or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
Looking at the products offered by Audatex, it's easy to see what kind of support it can provide to professionals in the industry.
The company offers ten different tools, with the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, at most ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertises, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it was removed from the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared wrecks.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, perform geo-demographic analyses or know common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious claims for a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a Einsa Group company, founded in 1971, as a provider of claims, breakdowns or car maintenance services and solutions.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has grown at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, with a turnover of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it undertook its internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
Solera Group’s global revenue (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera group was listed on the stock exchange for $1 billion, today its shares are valued at a total of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, he has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auction of accidental cars
In October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is exclusively for professionals in the industry, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, breakouts and professional sellers who need to be registered before starting operations.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1,500 sellers and 4,000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads a day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published each day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Older cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Garage bid in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, find the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, increases or discounts, then he can print the quote to hand it over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalog.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated labor time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
