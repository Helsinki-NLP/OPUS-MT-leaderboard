The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceptible weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously faltering, suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the deputy prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return in national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic one (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections of 2006, however loses 5.5%.
Even worse went for ÖVP, which lost almost 9% of the vote with 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in post-war Austrian history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the populars, which resulted in early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the populars had a considerable advantage in the preferences before SPÖ.
But voters have obviously punished them for sinking the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party president, Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
The observers believe that it could happen already Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the ever more likely exit from the election result, that is, towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties – the liberals (FPÖ) gained ahead of time 18% and the BZÖ 11% votes – but the socio-democrats revealed at the same time the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the populars in the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, even separated from the EU in 2005).
On this evolution obviously plays Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to collaborate with any party and presumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also managed to enter the parliament, but it fell slightly, dropping among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
No other party has evidently crossed the 4% threshold and failed to enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegal collection of beetle in India, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, some cooling of Czech-Indian relations would take place.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it didn't work out, then it would ,that there would be some cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that the executive branch can hardly meddle in legal affairs.
However, he mentioned that in Petr’s case, which was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling, which falls under his jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Kușera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, to have recourse to a higher instance.
Then he can ask for bail and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommends the appeal to the High Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to provide the condemned with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed down to India for many years.
The Indians admit it too,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told TK, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We truly consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists a profound mistake,” he said.
The minister avoided answering the question whether he got a promise from the Indian side to take care of the matter.
“I’ve gotten relatively many promises,” he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but in a small spot lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as big as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers on oceans and maritime rights issues.
His boss, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exposure and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and the enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms that carry within them the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest seabed on the mainland
Coastal states have begun to lend interest to underwater territory.
According to the OSN convention, they are approving of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention, it has an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental shelf.
In a nutshell, continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often beyond 200 nautical miles,” explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by very extensive technical-scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
“One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The committee has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees were successful,” adds Mikulka.
The recent success of Australia, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has registered a worldwide echo.
But New Zealand has also earned us – the seabed area, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers, so roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will fruit them in the future from the seabed, as they promise will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the “Montego Bay Convention” was ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area at the bottom of the ocean that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity begins.
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
“But the seabed is not Klondike,” director Mikulka exaggerated, “with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 under the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the extended Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it is an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
“It is possible to extract on the total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a field rich in polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings with him a find to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a little fancy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages – experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready but did not intervene.
More and more detailed information is coming to us about the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages seized.
German special units took part in the rescue operation, as cited by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
In addition to the army specialists, there were on-site GSG9 units, the Federal Avian Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the spokesman for the ministries said on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
“We didn’t get there fortunately,” a spokesman for the interior ministry said.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers in southern Egypt on September 19: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the abduction in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remained secret as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The freedmen have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not explain the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin by the time they returned to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units are expected to fly with an Airbus of the military air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout package.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there had not been a majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been stopped.
In a dramatic action, supporters desperately tried to persuade critics of the heavy $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, incited deputies to consensus, although the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While voting was ongoing, the Dow Jones fell by more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors’ concerns was that the state bailout could fail.
It recovered before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further serious turmoil on the international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters register increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover on travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has increased significantly – even for the winter season by more than 30%.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the Germans' desire to travel remains strong.
On bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in turnover over the same period of the previous year , as reported Monday in Berlin by the German Tourism Association DRV.
According to the survey of the GfK market research institute there are increased booking quotas already for the autumn months.
So the surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would amount to about 11%, the DRV reported.
Assume for these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyzes monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Included would also be travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar quote, particularly required would be travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly popular travel destinations with Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locations within Germany.
Especially all-inclusive trips have a high price, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and groceries, the costs in this case would be "better calculable for customers than for an individually organized holiday."
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for bookings made in advance or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months would also have been very good booking figures, so much so that compared to the previous year there would have been again an excess of turnover - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip, compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Hits by Ballermann, beer from one-liter jars and vip in Dirndln scrambled.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don’t have much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing is common to us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, the photographers are already throwing themselves at us and taking pictures to fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The two-dollar Dirndl seems to achieve its goal.
As a Wiesn tourist and an actual resident north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress to this day still remains within bounds.
But once you get to Theresienwiese, it’s nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only the apron of my Dirndl collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A nun points out to me that I would have tied the apron wrongly: "On the left you are free, in the center six virgins, on the right you are engaged, behind the widow."
I implore you to fix my bow from the back to the left.
“Okay,” he says and laughs.
Others waste less on subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which they head "To drink to get dressed!" and stretch their bare backs against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is named Bob, he comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a "oooooo" crease.
This tells me, after he got rid of his mug of beer from a liter he drank before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a trash can.
Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 p.m. the sanitaries walk in flocks on the square of the feast, which must take care of the poor
The nurses appear each time in packs – always 4 at a time drag a curtain-covered stretcher into the tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: you go empty, you come back full.
Whoever lies under the tarpaulin in this blood-alcohol coffin, you can't see.
“Des are die, wos goalnimmer packn,” one of the toilets yells at me and disappears into the shed.
Victim of an accident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died shortly thereafter.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on charges of inattentive driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the tour guides tell you.
The building stands on horseback between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the westernmost passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolian-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British forces and dominatrixes advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly crumbling, largely outdated by history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all points to the east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's growing diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has created an entire new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new commitment policy.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts of the AKP, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bouncing race along the tracks that produced the old-world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by shopping malls built means and bakeries of power, where managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
“The purpose of the foreign policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today he must look east and west at the same time.
It was not the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
“Turkey,” he says, “doesn’t want to face that choice.”
Then he points out one point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has recited by heart: the ties of the Middle East not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically travel those rail lines eastward across Asia and into the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle East ambitions can now largely be in Turkey's hands.
And as I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back across the Bosporus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent to advance demands on this fascinating country.
Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (nec., September 11) had in charge the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under 21/ under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang its final in 1979, many of us were over 20 – we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face everything the music presented to do, both madrigals and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let the music speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
“Sing it!”
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever the standard of music, it made it higher and higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a knight as a conductor, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with one of them – and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "ride around the world with one or two well-known battlehorses."
It will be missed by so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, a degree in letters and a PhD".
This follows from the Woodruff author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher at Hoplon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don’t know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They attracted my attention for the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments.”
Second Assault on Honda Supersales
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
Added to this is a refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a very similar line to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before we go on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after entering the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan alone, almost one million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the heads of the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz within a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the decline in sales in Spain by a good measure.
In fact, the company’s executives expect to reach the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 fewer than in 2007, down 16%.
Despite the increase in sales Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To do this, Honda is hoping for another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units per year worldwide.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of the Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in the company in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and it spans 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, it also expands the habitable interior.
This advantage comes on the one hand from the introduction of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with a double background – rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility in the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of commercialization, this small model will be offered in models with 1.2 and 1.4 liter petrol engines.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower fuel consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize the mechanics and at the same time maintain high engine torque in all its phases.
The 1.2-litre model offers power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horsepower, there are now 100 available.
The 100-horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, and bees in particular.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking for example the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, or the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an expansion of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer’s vehicles.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of bees, able to see in all directions with an angle of more than 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, the engineers developed what they called a laser range finder.
This mechanism detects obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately prevents collision.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at right or greater angles to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Lab and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect upwards or downwards, or even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can turn its wheels and not exploiting infinite directions and ways like bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device just needs to process the information every few seconds, and act on this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption and with only a couple of dozens of KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, and we’re not talking about mega.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the instantaneous prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the route.
Trembling before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging in junk mortgages in banks with dubious insolvency, they have created a fun and educational game for users of the network: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credits"... or problems.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to induce you to think not once, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It’s more of a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if the game is completed?
Well, there's a sleepo room in the hotel.
It’s still something, because to buy a better house doesn’t even speak...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest $9 billion in a 21% stake in the Company, as a result of a sharp drop in its shares in the stock exchange.
A week after the drafting of a provisional deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s stock at an individual cost of $25.25, or an amount equal to $3 billion.
The fixed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley said the global deal would be based on an average price of $29 per share, which is less than its current price of 28%.
At 17:00, Morgan Stanley fell by 6.79% to $23.07.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to a bank holding company,” said John Mack, chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which is expected to allow her to differentiate her stocks from the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than previously taken.
The modalities defined on Monday also show that in recent days the deal has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for an amount of $8.5 billion.
A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained: “We thought that our shareholding would be exclusively made up of ordinary shares.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will get Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their 7% book value.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into common shares in one year if, over a given period, these are traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or about $ 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to establish a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" eased its budget by the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to the test, which has seen the value of its shares halve while the cost of risk insurance has spiked.
However, the cost was still at a high level of around 12% on Monday.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” among the big Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
To establish the republic on a socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
According to the official results, 64% of voters voted “yes” to the referendum, on a basis of 80%.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white cards.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it would have to get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polls and an estimate from a non-governmental organization announced a crushing victory of the “yes”, placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday and Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously", he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The ballot, which took place in full calm according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the “development planning” of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction implemented by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to propose its candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the gratuitousness of health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions who were kidnapped 10 days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held in the desert for ten days were safely returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently fit, the hostages arrived at the military base in Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, around 15:30 a.m., aboard a special aircraft.
On board a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to give any press interviews, to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They are in “good health” and no ransom has been paid “to the kidnappers,” Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the runway.
Kidnapped on Sept. 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been whipped from one hideout to the next by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptus, the safari agency.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight, shortly before dawn.
"There were shotshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," the official said.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the “blitz” unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We have to admit that if we achieved that result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, the special forces," he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army said it had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which were the kidnappers and killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers are linked to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a claim immediately denied by the latter.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
On the front page a debate on the financing of culture focuses on the current election campaign.
So much the better.
But a part of our cultural life is always in the shadows.
Who will speak out to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or hunger-stricken national historic places?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying three and a half million euros for the restoration of the Château de Chinon, in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by common accord.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage assets preserve, with little money, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are the very ones who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision makers attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states help through partial nationalization the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which ended up in difficulty for the first time in Europe due to the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on the weekend agreed at the highest level, also involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been struggling for more than a year is that of Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard may constitute a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank’s share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first of all the assets, mainly insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis’ actions had begun with a vertical collapse, and serious signs of the institution’s crisis appeared in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank’s shares fell nearly 12 percent on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has declined by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current share prices the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank’s executives this value is not real.
The company’s summit blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the $700 billion US plan.
On Monday, the title slowly resumed.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new managing director of the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers but so far no one has come forward with a deserving offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they should not be afraid to lose money.
There was no panic among the bank’s customers, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken coop
Insurers on life and health, based on people’s medical purchase data, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like handing over the chicken coop to the fox,” writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick, author of the program to follow prescriptions.
Insurance companies subordinate the insurance rate and the amount due in the event of claims to the health of the customer and if they consider the risk too high they do not stipulate the insurance.
A long time ago the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was only concluded after the outcome of the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the customer's identification code you can easily get information from pharmacies about what medicines he bought in the last year and a half and from this the program evinces what diseases he suffers from and what health condition he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers this means that your blood fat level is virtually incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, so in addition to paper work there is not much left, even if small difficulties arise.
Among the cons are that some medicines are usable for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance - commercial point of view, applies as an increased risk factor, the first two do not.
For the request and processing of data, separate companies have been formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
Now the authorities force them to do so even if they have not so far imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies recently also process the results of laboratory tests and link them to the data of medicine consumption in order to provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data and at the same time the control of the use will be more and more difficult.
There is a separate privacy law, but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives supervisory authority to companies specializing in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: that is why he has developed a program that links the forwarding of data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise insurers do not enter into the contract.
So in the end the hens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Marseilles menu
EU and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade mainly with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit meeting has also been dominated by this theme, in addition to all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a major democratic power that should be given more voice in international affairs, but member states have yet to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So there was no emphasis on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso Chairman of the Committee and Javier Solana High Representative for Foreign Affairs received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double in 5 years, that is to increase to 100 billion euros, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious a goal.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only in ninth place among the EU’s partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms on both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in the energy and climate agenda, which would reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that we should sign a global pact at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb rising food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital today, where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that to build Indian nuclear reactors, French companies will receive a commission worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our news agency the agreement would last 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The press meeting will follow at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors gradually decreases on the total of Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children.
Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at 3000 meters above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
Wooden County Sheriff John Anderson said: “The plane has been located, we’ve sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it’s exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared.”
The sheriff said no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was put to death in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (Ntsb) said hours after the wreck was sighted a team of investigators had been dispatched, who then identified the device: the Bellanca 8kcab, which had been missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal belongings of Fossett had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been halted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an air balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he had travelled around the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among his many records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An out-of-the-box SUV with an original design and well defined by firm lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
This, in short, is the latest Glk to be born among the "compact" offroads of the starhouse with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of innovation in this sector.
Due to its content outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the SUV Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus the hype that will accompany the debut of the new car will initiate an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic campaign of 3D posters, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A maxi-poster project, divided into three different phases, that will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in near real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car is out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, then recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Blue National Team for years and that until now, in fact, had never created excessive problems.
He had never been in contact with his opponents.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added clusters (few units, actually) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the militants’ home cities appear: Saturday night they were removed to be unidentified.
They are inspired by the English fanfare.
In Bulgaria they found a fanaticism of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the game: all nominative, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium offenses, had been refused the ticket and prevented from travelling.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and will then take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international organization that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that is, that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, there are added others.
“We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way,” they say from the Viminale.
So, "eyes wide open especially in view of the National team game on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deals with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm stretched out during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria there is no crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, director of the Viminale Observatory for a few weeks (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been quaestor of Trieste where there is a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to innominate the Duke but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the number 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the fact occurs.
Until now this group had stayed in line, now we will see what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles at the Mameli anthem: those too are not a crime, but if you allow me I’m not an education...”.
