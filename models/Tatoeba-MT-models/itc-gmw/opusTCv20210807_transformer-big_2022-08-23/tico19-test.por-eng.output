Rapidly progressive cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the UK, confirming that although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare more for an outbreak of COVID-19 patients who will need care and, above all, intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a portion of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a novel coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
Mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the UK and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of that country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 from people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between December 31, 2019 and the date mentioned above, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources such as the country’s Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8am.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of reported cases of each country by March 15, 2020 at 8am, and compare it to Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the 14-day cumulative truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK in general followed those in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
Overall, for the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly by 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 reported cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that should be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including testing for updating.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission for COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal per 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of ICU and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 between 2010 and 2011).
Modeled scenarios related to health system capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk greater than 90% of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on intensive care cases and beds should preferably be made available in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s example and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical assistance, especially intensive treatment, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid increase in the number of cases predicted may not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions appropriately if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to step up their control initiatives to decrease the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure on the healthcare system.
If they fail in these initiatives, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients requiring intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus disease (SARS), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the rapidly developing research object.
We will deal with the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope this study will help in understanding and eradicating this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been forced to remain confined on the entire holiday and for several subsequent weeks due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease was named CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients killed.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “number one public enemy,” and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequencing of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as other pressing issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic that originated in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, current COVID-19 is the third COV epidemic in documented human history.
As shown in Fig.1,1, a portion of cases of pneumonia with unknown origins were initially reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019, to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequencing was published.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan’s first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the contagion of health professionals was communicated, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the place of onset of the infection by an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
To date, the disease has spread to China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation worsens rapidly, the final size and severity of the epidemic still needs to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a study of several centers with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the age group of 30 to 65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, some were under 20, and only 14 infected were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in groups, mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The average time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The basic reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people infected grew exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the mass transportation time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera, namely: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect humans.
The spike glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its cellular receptors of the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and sequential membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequencing samples collected from the same original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrathin sections of the human airway epithelium.
Human ECA2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to the human ECA2 protein weaker than the SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit expression of IFN; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ECA2 at a resolution of 2.9 microns in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for recognition and infection by CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The Host of Origin and the Intermediate
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like bat CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross species barriers and infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes carry the virus from bats to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that pangolins, elongated snout mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the 99% genetic homology between a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a big difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence are being expected (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry conditions and up to 5 days below 20 °C with humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and 56 °C heat for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are efficient at deactivating the virus.
Overall, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can consult only previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host’s innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including lectin-type C receptors, toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV’s N protein may help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including complements such as antibodies C3a and C5a, is also essential for fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects older adults with comorbidities and pregnant women more.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a greater chance of getting infected than other people.
The average estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and, most often, 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, demonstrates that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to the virus or infected by it usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended by 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which may come on its own or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, vertigo, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in lung imaging, should be screened for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group with transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilatory support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which is the highest mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was needed for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
Until February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, when confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Comparatively, SARS mortality as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4 only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with respect to their symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much bigger challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without presenting symptoms, and cured patients who have been discharged from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm to prolong the quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte counts below 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Levels of enzymes and myoglobins in muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of the D-dimer, a product of the degradation of fibrin present in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities in chest X-rays are present in most patients with COVID-19, and present irregular bilateral shadows or matt glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients usually developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely compromise gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most serious chest X-ray results usually correspond to the most serious form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the peeling of pneumatics, the formation of the hyalin membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncytial cells into the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which came to be derived not only from RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to arrive at an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at 20 x 10-18 mol/L at 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter of input) using a measuring rod in less than one complex hour, without needing to be tested.
We expect the new technique to dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors can provide, to the best of their ability, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients, while also trying a variety of therapies that have been used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, cured patient plasma, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ACE2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high-flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technique used for the treatment of severe cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine cascade results from the exacerbated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNF-, IL-1-, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the cells of the immune system to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat the cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for the cytokine cascade include modulation of the T-cell-directed immune response; blockade of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; cytokine 4 signaling suppressor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, drastically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of treatment with low to moderate doses of corticosteroids have been recommended for cautious use in severely ill patients with COVID-19.
By the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound to China to perform some tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are long awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-?, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of Healed Patients and Generation of Antibodies
The collection of blood from patients who have healed from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contraction of the disease has a long history.
In fact, cured patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, the plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who healed from COVID-19, and was injected into 10 severely ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be cautiously considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat severe patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to combat a worldwide epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or to screen for effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
In this way, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, TCM, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend greatly on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most of the effective components remain unknown, or are vague, as it is difficult to extract and check these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the leading alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The best cure rates for patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the time needed for recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and for hospitalization were considerably shorter in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than only in the group treated by Western medicine.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than for the group treated only by Western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than in the group treated only by Western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still awaiting more properly controlled tests on larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel great fear of the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychosis symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of the public health system’s actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of the contagion, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to people suspected of the disease and to people who have had contact with them, as well as to the general population who are in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives have been taken to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before the start of a clinical trial.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions, due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months on average) required for the development of a vaccine and variations in the dynamics of VOCs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognostic model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between the ages of 30 and 65, with 47.7% of patients being over the age of 50, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive treatment were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive treatment (mean age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women) as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to suffer an acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to cholangiocytes of positive ACE2, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have strong correlations and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or injury in the tissue and has been proposed as a potential prognostic factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
Correlation of the CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are present expressively in various organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Primary clinical symptoms: chest x-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues for the prediction of COVID-19 outcomes/complications.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants typically used as an adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dosage and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and witness the death of loved ones in the family and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the early stage of infection (or causes only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients in the initial phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most transmissions not occurring at the initial stage.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Major efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population, in the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic will end by March, and the deceleration phase will last between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and middle cornet smears of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new virus identified could become a flu-like cyclical episode.
However, promising indications have occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with the strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally kept under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker in its infectivity and at some point become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is below (Fig. (Fig. 55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing and sneezing and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which creates a new possibility: oral-fecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, co-workers and people in direct contact with patients or infected individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to decrease the risk of infection is the use of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 breathing masks (series n° 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent droplets of fluid from a potentially infected individual from being carried in the air or sticking to the surfaces of objects, where they can infect others.
However, only the N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation of virions from 10 nm to 80 nm in size, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and the two have approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health care professionals in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (Series No. 1860s) masks, but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should wear isolation bathrobes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health professionals should also wear transparent face protectors or protective glasses when attending patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home in isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to decrease the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a major alert for China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of infection and limited reproduction among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left people more relaxed, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for containment of the disease in Wuhan on a minimal scale was missed.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this tough lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public pronouncements, since everything they say is absorbed by the public periodically and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information coming from hospitals, rather than waiting for formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in its early stage, rather than attempting to stimulate the public.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic has generated a sense of SARS return.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are severely ill, which leads to greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic counterpart has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like Bat CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or have seasonal recurrence like the flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and so many others.
However, regardless of the efforts required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the coevolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human CoVs (HCoVs) caused a mild illness, such as a common cold.
Epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) changed what was thought about CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put CoVS in the spotlight again and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its SARS-CoV brother.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of enormous utility.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigation of CoV host interactions in animals may also provide important information about CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of existing information on the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is the comparison and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current epidemic of CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
What’s more, the requirements for effective host-to-host transition and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of encapsulated, positive polarity and single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses that have the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses have been named "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed under electron microscopy.
As for structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two overlapping open-reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
The polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific accessory line proteins are also encoded by different CoV lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genera contains the majority of HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the primary reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively greater number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the runny nose of patients with a common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating to date and has infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding, and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well-adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that HCoV parental viruses are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the trend of evolution of HCoV, in which increased transmissibility is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the runny nose of patients who contracted a common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superspreaders", it has been estimated that each contaminated person can contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and elevated creatine kinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients require, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney, can also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of the zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of choriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered all over the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crupe.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS, characterized by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar to MERS, among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses in human knowledge.
Halfway through the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which was known retrospectively to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and has also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the lethality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside that city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as do SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with the presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they may contribute to the rapid spread of the virus in the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the evolution of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four community-acquired HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during community-acquired HCoVs infection, including the presence of non-specific, mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 may also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is somewhat lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in community-acquired HCoVs and in SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies whether oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can exhibit seasonality, as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after its passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop serious diseases of HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If the adaptation is adequate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, the four community-acquired CoVs have circulated in human populations, causing a common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to humans, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and take the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as community-acquired HCoVs, at least to date.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be figured out whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbors a direct relationship ancestor, sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host houses HCoV in a continuous and lasting manner.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adapt adequately to the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifying host, allowing the virus to transiently replicate and then transmit it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
An HCoV may have the infection stopped if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that SARS patient zero had a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent investigations of seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of antiSARS-CoV IgG, compared to that of the general population.
Masked-palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the slaughter of all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild or farm-based masked palm civets without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could only be the intermediate amplifying host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals can serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these animals appear to be terminal SARS-CoV hosts.
Subsequent search for the natural SARS-CoV animal host revealed a narrow-linked bat CoV, named SARS-related Rhinolophus Bat CoV3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88%-92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoVs, with the exception of designated WIV1, can be isolated as live viruses.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) in humans is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from fecal samples from bats has been shown to use ACE2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor for entry into cells.
It is intriguing that serum from SARS convalescent patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the ancestor closest to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in betaCoVs of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, in the same way as Middle Eastern camels in several African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal smears of dromedaries, increasing evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that symptoms usually mild, but with massive transmission of the virus, have been observed in camels infected experimentally with MERS-CoV.
It is remarkable that infected camels transmit viruses not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus transmission in bats.
However, responses are still lacking, since many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which can be plausibly attributed to human-to-human transmission or to transmission routes involving unidentified animal species harboring MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat RaTG13 CoV isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless nearly identical bat CoVs are discovered in the future.
It is presumed that the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be configured between wild species sold and slaughtered at the Huanan Sea Fruit Wholesale Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of transmission from animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on mettagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small, endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbor ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to RaTG13, with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They cluster in SARS-CoV-2-like virus underlines in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity in the amino acid sequence.
In a huge contrast, the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, although they exhibit a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study of patient pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different configuration methods and manual curation to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of pangolin SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs related to pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 from pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest broad genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of the betaCoVs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 arises from the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterargument counts in favor of recombination between betaCoV of SARS-CoV-2-related pangolins and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat CoVs, while parental HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses were discovered in rodents.
A bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American tricolor bat was reported to have a direct relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and it is also suspected that camelids are its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs from bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been discovered.
Among them, there is an alpacas alphaCoV.
Several lines of evidence corroborate direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, but not alpacas, can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, alphaCoVs from HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpacas alphaCoV caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpacas alphaCoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that alpacas obtain from humans the HCoV-229E-related alphaCoV.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as a genetic pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, just like in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and has been corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, colonies with high density, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV in dromedaries dates back decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and has migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a mild disease and supports a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and humans remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, as their transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, is different.
Specifically, the betaCoVs of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be a terminal host for SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs, similar to civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts, in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had been newly introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is needed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three major factors in the virus are important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-tape RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average rate of substitution of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of the CoV to the new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with a review mechanism, the exclusion of which results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir suppresses replication of CoV by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising antiSARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the mutation rate is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host that maintains contact with humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts an extra plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and encoded protein functions relative to the last three inches of the end of the genome.
Third, CoVs swap models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a single "copy choice" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing vessel, tape exchange occurs frequently during transcription of CoV RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between SARS-CoV isolates from humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the DLR of the S protein.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensively selected by the host’s antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is at amino acids 318o to 510o in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its co-receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human and civet viral isolates in the DLR, and four of them are located in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of civets has K479N and S487T mutations in their DLR, which could increase the affinity of spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implies that the binding affinity of its S protein to human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study using electron cryomicroscopy indicates a 10- to 20-fold greater affinity for this binding than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be useful to determine if any other co-receptor may be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the S protein.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They could also respond for the effective adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence with the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-trendy screening with genome-wide range of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero stake
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes from protein coding has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to humans, since the bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but they have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A nucleotide 29 exclusion characteristic of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
Exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic underwent recombination events between different strains, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from the relief of selection pressure exerted on viruses, such as the pressure of the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E strain, due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, alpacas alphaCoV presents a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in frames.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Lack of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It is likely that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminating cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the natural exterminating cell inhibitor receptor NKG2/CD94, and the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species (REOs) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress CoV replication and affect exorribonuclease review, thus providing the selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of proteins or novel protein characteristics for host adaptation.
So it’s no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or cause at most mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without eliciting a high immune response from the host.
This document explains the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of severe cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytokine cascade, in which the higher the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was disconnected from CoV replication.
The same immune response shutdown strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 in the bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it has been discovered that bat betaCoV shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a bat CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in markets have been found to harbor viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology to SARS-CoV-2, have been discovered, indicating that pangolins may serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or the betaCoVs of pangolins may contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made accidentally or intentionally.
CoVs have returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human-to-human transmission.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in the bat and are transmitted to people via intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civets in the markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple betaCoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and how this transmission occurs.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transportation, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool to the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurring MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach must be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, the CoVs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crisis, a better response and preparedness plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continued surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for people to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin puzzle are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection must be performed.
If it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are nearly identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide to diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection of 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide conveys our experience and is a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; because of this, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspicious case” and “confirmed case” according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially referred to as 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted excellent attention since publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; because of this, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in context in some.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We endorse his significant work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs updating according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine one item of the elements of epidemiological history with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to comply with three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported within the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms originating in the city of Wuhan and other nearby areas of COV.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte counts at the early stage of symptom onset.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing exhibiting high homogeneity with respect to known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive for IgM and IgG antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 over-phase increase in serum IgG; or some change in antibody IgG-2.
We can note that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples was added to the second and third editions (of January 18 and 22, 2020, respectively).
Pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth and fifth editions (of January 27, 2020 and February 8, 2020, respectively), and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the ongoing work of researchers in the search for an ideal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us to pay attention to atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be checked in more studies and clinical practices.
To conclude, we look forward to the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their feedback.

Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
The Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news report, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic on March 11.
A hospital agent told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video online statement, Bengali Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be stalled longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport shutdown began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 surpasses one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections worldwide passed one million, data from Johns Hopkins University showed.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
That milestone came the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea said Thursday it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. on Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's total blockade until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that the Russians would continue to be remunerated without attending work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days. The vote was passed by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew for the entire day in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce toilet paper limits per transaction
On the evening of Saturday and Sunday, Australian store networks Woolworths and Coles reduced restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper, respectively, to two packages and one package per transaction at all stores in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a one-package limit.
These limitations were communicated through messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
For fear of COVID-19, buyers were reportedly stockpiling in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of home delivery toilet paper to one package per order.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, said that even with the restriction of four packages, “many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery” and called the demand “unprecedented,” while ALDI called it “unexpected” in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales rose sharply last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco’s Canberra store also limited the amount allowed to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made stocks available in advance of a promotion planned for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but that local board restrictions on the frequency of truck deliveries make this difficult.
It expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to carry out Wednesday’s promotion.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores replenish inventory every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that when sold out, it leaves many empty spaces on the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion that if there were an abundant amount on the shelves, if products like toilet rolls and antiseptics could be bought and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives Crap said on Wednesday they would run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain supply, according to news.com.au report.
Real estate website domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to early Melbourne auctioneers when fewer auctions were being held with buyers entering on leave on the extended Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday issue of NT News, a Darwin daily printout, included an eight-page insert intended to be trimmed and used as toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
Just like in Australia on Sunday night, British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the current outbreak of COVID-19 – the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 – is a pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO emphasized the need to push governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is an “unprecedented” pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that “outside of influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been monitored from the emergence to continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that “we have never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus.”
“We’ve never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO’s January decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the outbreak, “in short, will get worse.”
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuing pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment known.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping away from people, and monitoring and isolating people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures of establishments.
The pandemic has triggered a severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Disinformation about the virus has spread online and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese people, people of East and Southeast Asian descent and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia for unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
To a large extent, the cases were linked to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood and therefore the virus is believed to have zoonotic origin.
The outbreak-causing virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that is closely linked to bat, pangolin and SARS-CoV coronaviruses. The first person with known symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019 and had no visible connections with the later group of the seafood market.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two-thirds were linked to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unchecked report from the South China Morning Post suggested that one case pointed to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei Province, which may have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that as new cases reported decreased in China, but suddenly increased by the number of new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases had risen by the first time out.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
Until February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK’s top scientific consultant, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries had adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, by January 23, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection in 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over the age of 60 and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic typically refers to people who died and had positive COVID testing, according to official protocols.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without having taken the test, for example, who died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
The partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that “we know [the official death toll] is underestimated,” a statement corroborated by episodic reports of under-reporting in the U.S. This under-estimation often occurs in pandemics such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan, on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Various measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time from the initial outbreak and by the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given range.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) by April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the rate of lethality (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die due to a disease, and the rate of lethality of the infection (FRgno).
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific population of the infection through the resolution of the case.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall fatality rate from infection to pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: “Without proper control, infectious epidemics often peak and then decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it’s almost impossible to make any proper projections at the moment about when that will happen.”
Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government's senior medical adviser, said it could "end by June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “probably will remain in circulation for a year or two.”
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary “until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it’s highly transmissible” and “it could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year.”
The virulence of recurrence will depend on the group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretion (catarro), loss of olfactory sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms are difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and blue-colored face or lips. It is advisable to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming the infection, so researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a person with a confirmed infection be monitored and examined closely to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from some up to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost olfactory sensation was initially 30% and subsequently dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is mainly spread by close contact and small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or speaking, the close contact being considered 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause the droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing droplets can also be produced during exhalation, including while speaking, although the virus is not normally in suspension.
The droplets can land in the mouths and noses of nearby people or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in airborne spread.
The spread can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their own eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the stool, the risk of this happening is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other people. The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, for one day in cardboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans, however, British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus resemble those of coronaviruses related in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same lineage are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, at the entire genome level, to other coronavirus samples from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolin virus and that of humans.
Comparing the entire genome, so far, has found a maximum of 92% sharing of genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms. The definitive confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography (CT).
A Wuhan study comparing rRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, though less specific, with many of its imaging features coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CT not be used for screening or as a front-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis.”
The WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually made available from a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is performed on nasopharyngeal smear, although the throat smear is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these had been shown to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The peculiarities of X-ray and CT imaging of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral matte glass opacities and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an international online database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as that by adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to those of PCR and showed that while the image is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed for the detection of features of X-ray and CT imaging of the virus.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a tissue, and placing this tissue directly in a waste container.
People who have been infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some community members do not know where or how they were infected. Healthcare professionals are recommended to care for individuals who may be infected to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
Governments’ use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts on how to prevent infection have circulated, such as rinsing the nose and gargle with mouthwashes, which has already proven ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine. However, several organizations are working on developing one.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty. Hands should also be washed before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol when there is no soap and water readily available.
The WHO advises you to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (up to one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% iodopovidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in case of suspicion or COVID-19 confirmation in a location, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with a folded elbow or a paper scarf when coughing or sneezing, as well as discarding any scarves immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and displacement of expiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing, or coughing.
The WHO has published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing masks can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene." It has also been recommended to wear masks by caregivers of people who may have the disease.
The WHO has recommended wearing masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people not to touch their own faces.
In many countries, the use of face masks by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face masks made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming in close contact with another person (stay 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a surgical mask when using public transport or while staying in crowded places.
Thailand’s health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering your nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear face masks when going out in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone who enters supermarkets should wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, has required passengers on intercity trains and buses to wear face masks as of April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to use face masks when going out on the street. At the same time, it is recommended to produce masks at home for those who cannot buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the transmission of the disease, by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Social distancing methods can be applied by everyone while staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping away from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in a region) to 50 people and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face a higher risk of serious illnesses and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic. By the end of March 2020, the WHO and other bodies began to use the term “social slavery”.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to implications that social isolation is needed rather than encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities have published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with who doesn’t have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspect they were infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have required or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive autoquarena instructions were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with wide-scale transmission have been advised to do 14 days of autoquarena since the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
Containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as present other infection control measures and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are being made to reduce it: the measures taken now serve to decrease the speed of the spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time, in combination.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic at a basic reproduction rate of less than 1. Management of an infectious disease outbreak, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. This is what we call "flattening of the epidemic curve".
This reduces the risk of overloading health services, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not of a pharmaceutical nature and that can administer the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, the use of face masks and autoquarena; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of events that lead to crowds; community involvement, in order to stimulate the acceptance and participation in these interventions.
Other countries have taken various measures to ensure that the spread of the virus is limited.
South Korea, for example, presented mass screening and localized quarantines, and the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when carrying out the autoquartena and, for those who did not, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there has been an increase in the production of face masks and those who stockpiled medical supplies have been punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (the decrease in the speed of contagion, without stopping with the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (i.e. the reversal of the growth of the epidemic) present major challenges.
Optimal reduction policies can reduce the peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, while overloading health systems.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as there is the circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is the availability of a vaccine, if this occurs earlier. Otherwise, the transmission occurs again as soon as the relaxation of the measures occurs.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug that is specific to COVID-19. There are, however, efforts to develop drugs, which include testing existing drugs.
Using cold medications that don’t require a prescription, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, the use of oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid may be necessary.
Steroid use can worsen the condition.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also stated that some “homemade and traditional” medicines can relieve the symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to move their resources, at various levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures and the separation and training of patients with positive COVID-19 testing in addition to increased capacity.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case in the new coronavirus dates from December 1, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region gradually increased.
These cases were, in large part, linked to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Prevenhan Jixian, at the Wuhan Medical Hospital of Hubei, the following day.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a “SARS-type coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by police for spreading fake news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for setting the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, on December 31, made a statement to the population and informed the WHO.
Enough cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven-and-a-half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, facilitated by the Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub, as well as a main rail connection point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy, with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
Reactions from countries included containment measures such as quarantines (also known as house arrest orders, house arrest orders or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, some 300 million people (nearly 90% of the population) are somehow confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, around 59 million people are confined in the Philippines.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were already in some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests a previous case on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26. Her hospital reported to the Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control on December 27.
Initial genetic tests, on December 27, 2019, in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronavirus.
A communiqué to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan’s doctors were warned by police for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed there was no “clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a “people’s war,” to curb the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as “the largest quarantine in human history,” a sanitary cordon was announced on Jan. 23 to disrupt round-trip trips to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities in Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations on January 25 were canceled in several locations.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to treat more patients.
Alongside the newly built hospitals, China converted another 14 Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals such as convention centers and stadiums. On January 26, the government launched more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health statements for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country have also been closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken various measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were placed on Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified, and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
Public movement control has been applied in several cities, and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) have gone through some sort of exit restriction. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all international travelers arriving in the city. On March 23, mainland China had only one case of domestic broadcasting in five days, in this case, through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Chinese Foreign Minister announced, on March 26, 2020, that the entry of individuals with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details on when this policy will be terminated.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to companies. The Council of State declared a day of mourning, starting with a three-minute moment of silence across the country, on April 4 at 10 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked families to pay their respects online.
On January 20, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country’s national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as Shincheonji’s Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to have been the source of the outbreak.
On February 22, among the 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on February 29.
All military bases in South Korea have been quarantined after testing confirmed three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The schedule of the airlines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world in terms of screening the population for the virus. The country also isolated the infected people and tracked and quarantined those who came in contact with them.
Screening methods included mandatory individual symptom reporting for those arriving from international travel via a mobile app, drive-thru virus testing, with results available the next day, as well as increased testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it has not quarantined entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment on the allegation of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was announced that from April 1 all new arrivals from abroad should be quarantined for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with virus testing from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Feb. 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion Rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantined areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, though heavy traffic between cities before the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
Amid allegations of covering up the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their Iran-related cases on Feb. 28 indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to date.
The Iranian parliament closed with 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders jailed for peaceful dissent, and also to release all eligible prisoners temporarily.
The agency said there is a higher risk of spreading the virus in institutions closed as detention centers, which also suffer from a lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number since the outbreak began in the country.
At least 12 current or retired politicians and government officials died as a result of the disease by March 17.
As of March 23, Iran has had 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to Coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five times as many cases in Iran as are being reported.
It is suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country’s financial capacity to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be eased for the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, “In the outbreak areas, entry and exit of people are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. “On March 4, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities across the country when Italy hit 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, will have to be held behind closed doors by April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding the screening protocols that could be employed.
On March 19, Italy passed China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 pandemic-related deaths.
On March 22, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical supplies to Italy.
As of April 5, it had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with the majority of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus so far may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK response to the virus first emerged as one of the mildest of the affected countries, and by March 18, 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the acknowledged lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a pronouncement in which he advised the interruption of all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work from home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and academies should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay 80% of workers’ wages up to a limit of 2,500 pounds a month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distancing measures, preventing crowding with more than two people and restricting travel and activities to the minimum required.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police by issuing fines and dispersing agglomerations.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with exceptions for businesses deemed “essential,” including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and car shop.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control – the U.S. government’s leading public health institute – announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start to testing, which obscured the true extent of the outbreak at that time.
Testing was marked by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal approval for non-government test kits (from academies, businesses and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested by early March (a medical request was subsequently required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been performed.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported, “Many people who have symptoms and had a medical request had to wait hours or days to take a test.” After the first death in the United States was reported in Washington state on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, an action that was briefly followed by other states.
Schools in the Seattle area canceled classes on March 3, and by the second half of March, schools across the country were closing. On March 6, 2020, the United States was warned about projections for the impact of the new coronavirus on the country by a group of epidemiologists from Imperial College London.

Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne have also been reported as popular destinations for people who have traveled from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least capable among the 20 most popular destinations in terms of preparation, while cities in Australia were deemed the most capable. Australia authorized its Emergency Response Plan for the New Coronavirus (COVID-19) on February 7.
She stated that much was yet to be discovered about COVID-19, and that Australia would emphasize border control and communication in its response to the pandemic.
On March 21, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.
Due to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to withdraw their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights from the home nation, with the release of Chinese authorities.

Subsequently, he sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 fans to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain collected 58,000 Coronavirus test kits made by China with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands returned 600,000 defective face masks.
Belgium collected 100,000 unusable masks, which were supposedly from China but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China’s aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities have been accused of omitting data that hindered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government “provided regular updates to avoid panic near the Lunar New Year festivities.”
On 23 January, in reaction to the decision of the main authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea has stated during the WHO’s Public Health Act that “this was certainly not a recommendation of the WHO” and was also “a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated”. On 30 January, after the confirmation of human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of other cases
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was invoked because of the “risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and travel.”
On February 5, WHO called on the global community for a $675 million contribution to fund a strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency to assist those countries that “have no systems in place to detect the people who contracted the virus, and even if it arises.”
Tedros made subsequent statements indicating that “we are as strong as our weakest link” and asked the international community to “invest now or will have to pay later.” On February 11, WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros declared that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to provide “the power of the entire UN system in response.”
The United Nations Crisis Management Team has been activated as a result, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations response, which WHO states will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies can enter with their expertise in the social, economic and developmental implications resulting from the outbreak.”
On February 14, a WHO Joint Mission Team with China was empowered to provide the WHO and international experts on the ground in China with a pandemic to assess “the severity and communicability of the disease” through workshops and meetings with major national-level institutions and to conduct field visits to assess “the impact of response activities on the levels of provinces and municipalities, including urban and rural panoramas”.
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the Coronavirus threat at a global level would be elevated from “high” to “very high”, is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that “This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready,” insisting that the right response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan further stated that current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that “we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the Coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said WHO was "deeply concerned about alarming levels of spread and severity, and alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced many criticisms for what was seen as inadequate pandemic management, including late declaration of a public health emergency and classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The response included a petition to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to present his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the government is responsible.
The group emphasized that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that each individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, people with mental problems, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, people in prison, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups that need government help.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the effects of confinement and restrictions on travel, the digital center includes a Country Policy Tracker, which helps countries learn from each other and facilitates a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, the UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for managing the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been fired because of their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the Coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected an early recognition of the Coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
Donald Trump’s U.S. administration referred to Coronavirus as the “Chinese Virus” or “Wuhan Virus” saying that China’s censorship “supercharged a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and “a way to divert the administration’s failure to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained from a U.S. government cable a detailed communications ploy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being cited as “This all has to do with China.
“Channels such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have indicated that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda campaign for global influence.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a biased and 'generosity' policy point of view."
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also asked the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending aid to those same countries.
Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. officials have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own country.
And he hears disputes related to the masks reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of fans destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union’s lack of solidarity with those affected by Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “Only China responded bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous “high-level political source” that 80 percent of Russia’s supplies were “useless or of little use for Italy.”
The source accused Russia of embarking on a “geopolitical and diplomatic” offensive.
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, dispensed with the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are at a good stage, they would also act reciprocally if necessary.”
The planned NATO “Defender 2020” military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO’s largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a small scale.
Secretary General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the 2020 Defender exercise: “In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate.” The Iranian government was heavily affected by the virus, with about a dozen exercising politicians as well as former quinzes.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of pay.
Political analysts have anticipated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated locations.
South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment of what they called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising his response. The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency laws in response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those deemed to have spread fake news about the virus and the government’s management of the crisis.
The Coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of supply shortages, resulting from increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and supplier disruptions.
Several locations also experienced the panic-driven shopping event which led to empty shelves of essentials such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortages of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned about delays in shipping electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has risen 100 times.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that it would put workers’ health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of baby formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the resulting high demand for food products, both areas were spared an acute food shortage.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding the acute food shortage that was predicted in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not seen a large reduction, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to maintain reserves for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5 percent.
Because mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist’s intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges of possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could outpace the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated a $300 billion impact on the world’s supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reportedly “confused” after a sharp decline in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on Feb. 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On Feb. 27, due to growing concerns about the Coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock market indices including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones industry average showed their most significant drops since 2008, with the Dow drop by 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three other indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again based on concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest fall on March 16.
Many consider it a likely economic downturn.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial meltdown.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including sights, and government recommendation against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry has been at an unprecedented level.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several events involving large crowds have been canceled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year’s festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass crowding, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, officials have extended the New Year’s holiday to Feb. 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen by that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its level of infectious disease response to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools by March and cancelling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
Shopping Center operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check buyers’ temperatures, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers were abandoned at home in inland provinces or imprisoned in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government help.
The Coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32% in March, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily pay) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have lost me to some kind of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment assistance and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit program. Nearly half a million companies in Germany put their workers under government-subsidized short-time work programs known as Kurzarbeit.
The German reduced-time pay program was adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as people – both employed and independent – worldwide.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and help artists where possible.
In March 2020, across the world and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have taken place to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and high-accelerating repercussion of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion events.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week rites in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been canceled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live streaming online or on television while others offer drive-in-style worship.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter’s Square empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and Gurdwaras.
Iran’s health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as their residents into sacred sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption in the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled for a date after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gaming venues around the world were closed and face-to-face poker tournaments were also postponed or canceled.
This has led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with several music groups suspending or canceling their tours.
Many major theaters like those on Broadway also canceled all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work online as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live-streaming shows or creating online “festivals” for artists to perform, share and disseminate their work.
Online, several internet memes about coronavirus are spread, as many seek humor and entertainment amid uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people from focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, distrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February results (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserving of the virus or being given a fair punishment for what they provoked.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is targeted at those in the areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak in new focus countries, citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to distrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pressing for a ban on Chinese entry into their countries, in an attempt to conter.
In Japan, the hashtag ?ChineseDontComeToJapan went to Twitter’s Trending Topics.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has come under fire for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which borders China, and students in major cities in India reportedly suffered persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party state unit in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese destroyed nature and “that’s the reason God turned against them.”
In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents have been inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners being called "foreign garbage" and targets of "discarding."
Many newspapers with paid access have removed them from some or all of the coronavirus coverage.
Several scientific editors have made scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS - CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and developed only to detect RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (sorology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who became asymptomatic.
An accurate rate of disease mortality and herd immunity level in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the amount of tests carried out in the countries.
This variability probably still substantially affects the mortality rates of recorded cases, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal smear or saliva sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours or 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharyngeal smear is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternatively, the material of the samples can be removed from the bottom of the airways by suction catheter or material expelled by expectoration (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It searches for the gene "E" shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the gene RdRp, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive approval for emergency use from China's National Medical Product Administration for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention is Distributing the ReCoagent Innovative
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests based on failed reagents, and an impediment to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout the month of February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only from then on were local and state laboratories allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for the RT-PCR-based COVID-19.
Quest Diagnostics also made testing for COVID-19 nationally available as of March 9, 2020.
No quantity restrictions have been announced; the collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be conducted within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (U.S.A.) to Abbott laboratories for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorization for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S. FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott hopes to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and links it in a particular way to the nucleocapsid protein (protein N) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "chest x-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT, CT, and CT scans may be present even before symptoms appear."
Typical CT features include bipolar multilobar matt glass opacities with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many of its imaging aspects coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR for an initial checkup.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days ago or shortly after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring. Assays can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through remote laboratory tests (PoCT).
High-productivity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by cutaneous puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection step is not required before the test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that notified the agency as required, and from now on are able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an authorization for emergency use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
Antibodies are normally detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK considered that none of the acquired antibody test kits were suitable enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which suspicious patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient appropriately used"; they must expel saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result shortly after. The British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test the suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they go to the hospital or a need to disinfect.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea perform some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Chartered Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, of which 10,700 had been tested the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that from the 12th week of 2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples can be tested by laboratory m considered by laboratory m considered by the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, gathering the samples and performing only additional tests.
With construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, modeling revealed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with quarantine would have doubled if that testing capability had no online access.
The Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily yield was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed models released by Origami Assays were released as being able to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19, using only 93 trials. These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic manipulators for liquids.
In March, shortages or insufficient amounts of reagents became a hindrance to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols involving heating the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was disclosed that the UAE is now doing more tests per inhabitant in its population for Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on track to increase the level of testing to greater extent.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capability, and the acquisition of a Group 42 population-scale mass processing laboratory and BGI (inspired by its “Huo-Yan” emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world’s first such scale to operate outside of China.
Different test methods aimed at different components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany’s method for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, there was a delay in the tests made available to the U.S. and to China and the U.S. faced problems with the reliability of the test kits well in the beginning of the outbreak, in addition, these countries near Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing by professionals.
In contrast, experts say South Korea’s wide availability for testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the government of South Korea.
On March 16, the World Health Organization pointed to the strengthening of testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private U.S. laboratories, and the supply of cotton swabs and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems accurately in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the particular tests. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a failure to collect samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The minister of Spain said he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China generated incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that he would not "use them". The UK acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not useful.
The testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and monitoring of those with whom SARS-CoV-2-positive people had contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of Italy’s first COVID-19 death, performed two stages of testing the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were placed in quarantine.
With commuting restricted, this completely eliminated new infections.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions for the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore in 2020 has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began seriously advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on schedule after the holiday on March 23.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions for the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that the countries that performed the most tests, relative to the number of deaths, had the most lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect those with no or little symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of WHO’s 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Percentage positive testing" is influenced by the countries' testing policy.
A country that tests only people in hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing your hands for the purpose of removing dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the oro-fecal route.
People can also get infected with respiratory diseases such as the flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five crucial times during the day when washing your hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, franc or fish.
If soap and water are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand cleansing:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, feed or animal waste.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is particularly important for people handling food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and decreasing the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for hand washing can cause small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to underserved areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhoea episodes may be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), such as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the leading cause of death among children under five, takes the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into a deep-rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections in a quarter.
Handwashing is usually associated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a skin scaling and irritation condition known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Frequent hand washing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial times during the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (urination, defecation), after cleaning a child’s buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other situations when the correct technique for washing hands should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cut or injury; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of households had the habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest index at 97 percent; the United States near the average at 77 percent; and China with the lowest index at 23 percent. Several methods for behavioral changes currently exist to increase acceptance about the habit of washing hands with soap in critical periods.
The “Essential Health Services Program” implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children’s health and education.
Deworming twice a year, supplemented by daily hand washing with soap, daily tooth brushing with fluoride, are at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleansing agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic dirt, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that looked at the bacterial transmission of a contaminated bar soap concluded that transmission is unlikely since the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic commands for dosing is preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been widely disseminated to the health-conscious public.
To date, there is no indication that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can lead to the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protecting agents, complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other moisturizers for the skin (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health diseases indicated that the final soaps are as effective.
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37oC).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove the natural oiliness that retains dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous-based hand sanitizing agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-aqueous hand-hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand-hygiene product, antiseptic hand-hygiene product, or hand-hygiene) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a moisturizer, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand hygienizers that contain a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to the reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands, 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost totally ineffective against the norovirus-like virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Hand sanitizers or alcohol-based sanitizers can be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The backs and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their extremities, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed, being rubbed with both palms. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with hand sanitizers, especially when the hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid exterminating action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause skin to dry out unless skin emollients and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based hand sanitizers rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause irritant contact dermatitis has become an attractive compared to washing your hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous base agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, they only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as water and soap for preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and has historically fallen far short of alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkone chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford a soap and instead use ash or dirt.
Grey or earth may be more effective than pure water, but they may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands with cold or hot running water.
Running water is recommended since fixed washbasins may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem to be relevant.
Rub your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap instead of pure water.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and rubbing for a longer time removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Washing in a sink can re-contaminate the hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let it dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are more easily re-contaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial and lacquered enamel can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep your hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or baking with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "improvised nozzles" and other low-cost options.
An improvised tap is a simple technology that uses a jug suspended by a rope, and a lever operated by the feet to pour a small amount of water into the hands and a soap bar.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
A growing volume of research suggests that towel papers are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene presented by paper towel, heated air hand dryers and the most modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% higher in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air jet dryers caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the palm area near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying their hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. The researchers also performed tests to determine if there was potential for cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which projects air out of the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the unit potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hand dryer with hot air spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
The towel papers did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Handwashing with wet hand sanitizer handkerchiefs is an alternative to lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates reduced with their use.
Clinical hand washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to soap and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the interlacing of the fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents recontamination of the hands by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
A study revealed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can lower the rate of catheter-related infections in the bloodstream by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and friction in the health system sectors.
The organization’s draft guidance for hand hygiene can also be found on this website for comments.
An applicable review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body fluids/blood
before an ascetic task, and
after patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soaps "medicinal" or "antimicrobial") confers an exterminating action to a hand washing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" the hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine antiseptics, sterilized towels to dry the hands after washing, and a brush others to clean the hands.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms to the elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, water in the forearms should not drain into the hands.
After handwashing is completed, the hands are wiped with a sterilized towel and the surgical gown is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after you meet a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and an additional little significant benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Washing with common soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand sanitization with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds for each revealed that the alcohol-based hand sanitizer reduced the antibacterial contamination by 26%.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers to reduce the influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands. Interventions to increase hand sanitization in hospital environments may involve raising staff awareness about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and seeing alcoholic and advertising hand sanitizers.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different health facilities.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water sources, soap or handwashing resources in people’s homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to conquer the universal practice of handwashing.
For example, in most rural Africa hand-washing taps near any public or private toilets are rare, although there are inexpensive options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low rates of hand washing may instead be the result of ingrained habits and not the absence of soap and water.
Encouraging and advocating handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and trigger a long-term change in population behavior.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF’s “Three Star Approach” which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to three maximum stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be a part of the promotional handwashing campaigns carried out with the aim of reducing diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign trying to get a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has released the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of handwashing in developing countries to DALY classification.
However, one analysis suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two forerunners of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English “founder of modern nursing.”
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with “techniques for proper hand washing” were hung next to handwashing sinks in public toilets and in bathrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression “washing hands” means declaring reluctance to take responsibility or to be conniving about something.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a phrase of more general use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clear an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and usually attach more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of “cleaning,” such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual hand washing characteristic in many religions, including the Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, Tevilah and Netilat Yadayim in Judaism, the washbasin also in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam authorize hand washing after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam allow hand washing before and after meals.
Workplace Hazard Controls for COVID-19
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational health and safety methodologies to hazard controls for the prevention of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Adequate hazard controls in the workplace depend on the workplace and the work itself, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
According to the Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), the functions with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory tag, and a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Functions at average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or direct contact with people who are not known to be contaminated or suspected of being contaminated by COVID-19, but may be infected due to current community transmission or having traveled abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments, and in the large-volume retail market.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include used ventilation of high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings and provision of personal protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care and morgue workers who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to too high if workers perform procedures on people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 aerosol generation and collect or handle specimens from those people.
Suitable hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have several effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they become ill, have to take care of other people, or are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of which products are in demand and the means of purchasing those products (such as shopping outside peak hours or for delivery or drive-thru services).
Finally, the shipment of items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be stopped. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors for individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls needed to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action and preparedness plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The goals for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people who are at higher risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a framework widely used in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls for effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, ultimately, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the work policy or procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the hazard to the worker, adjusted appropriately as needed (breathers, for example), used appropriately and continuously, inspected regularly, stored and replaced as needed, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of appropriately to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), jobs with low risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, and the use of respiratory labels, including covering sneezing and coughing, preparing containers for handkerchiefs and common garbage, preparing for teleworking or for other cleaning and disinfection equipment, if necessary, disinfection and disinfection.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or relief from other symptoms, and also recommends that employees have policies for sick leave that are flexible, allow them to be employed by the home.
According to OSHA, jobs with average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known to be confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to current community transmission in the company’s locality, or because the individual has a recent history of traveling abroad, in a country with high COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public such as in schools, workers who are in contact with the general public, workers who are in contact with the general public such as in schools, workers who are in contact with the general public, workers who are in contact with the general public such as in contact with the general public, workers who are in contact with the general public such as in contact with the general public, workers who are in contact with the general public such as in contact with the general public.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolating the sick person from other people for a distance of 6 feet, with the assignment of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer him a face mask, or requesting that the sick person cover the mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The crew must wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a bag for biohazardous waste, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include delayed travel by the sick passenger, self-isolation, and immediate communication to the onboard medical center if anyone experiences fever or other symptoms during travel.
For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community broadcasting, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large groupings such as physical education classes or choirs, or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between tables, tighter arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using a separate health care location for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, prolonged dispensations from school can be considered. For law enforcement authorities performing daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who come into contact with individuals suspected of COVID-19 or with the confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medicine technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during the seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposition of used PPE and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and morgue workers to be in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
Functions at high risk of exposure include drug delivery, healthcare, laboratory and medical transportation workers, who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens from these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive specimen collection.
Work in high exposure mortuaries include workers involved in preparing bodies of people with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure makes it very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease, including when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure may be appropriate in some morgue scenarios and in the area of health.
Specimens should be handled with caution at biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter the hospital be separated into two distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals working at a distance of 6 feet from patients with confirmation or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 Particle Filtered Facial Respirators or Superior Quality Respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of jumpsuits, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
The WHO recommends only a surgical mask for screening staff at the entry point.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or carry patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial protection, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients to enter a room with a patient with COVID-19, using only the PPE needed for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it while monitoring multiple patients with the same use.

We find ourselves in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Their challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and community building, which are the foundations of that organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege to work.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have you all as co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
This person reminded me how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol it is that this essential feature remains online and available to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, because you keep the workplaces active, pay our co-workers, and keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but the way we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the coming days and months.
In this meeting, we consider what we think is an action appropriate to what we are experiencing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this period.
We want to end stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to leave for a while, that's okay.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily work expectancy will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise provided.
We are not declaring a holiday. If you can work on normal schedule, it may be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy groceries or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
This rule would not even need to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
No attestation or paid leave is required. Just tell your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure key areas of work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please inform Bryan of the training and certification industry so that his industry can help you and ensure that your situation receives the appropriate attention from management.)
People who work hourly will receive the full payment.
We’ve said this before, and we’re committed to honoring our commitment to our hourly contractors and employees.
Everyone will receive their wages based on their normal work schedule under normal circumstances.
Salaries are independent if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give you full support.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remember that your well-being is more important.
We just ask that you communicate to your manager, so that we know what to expect and can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to do.
Site Reliability Engineering, HR, Reliability and Security and Fundraising teams (among others) perform essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate current goals and shift our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is a lot to do for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us in the future.
We do not intend to “double up to recover lost time” after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and will work to set new goals and deadlines as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of working hours per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and that employees prioritize the essential work, personal care and care of loved ones, while accommodating those who need or want to work on a reduced journey in the coming weeks.
The schedule extension greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the Annual Planning team for their leadership in this process.
Office Status, Exhibition and Cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco co-workers may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, as a precaution, we employed an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance lobby and all elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is employing its own protocol of care duties using products that are safe for its attendants.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all Washington employees.
Last week, our Washington office switched to a fully remote setting, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing renting an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
Limit the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them into several days.
Define the meeting, have a schedule, and send in advance materials for reading.
Use videos as standard, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make it easier to collaborate and connect in real time.
Have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone to monitor questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
Participate in the ?remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to help increase remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editing marathons, until the WHO declares an end to the pandemic.
We advised you that we understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete your agreed grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying your goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and community-themed conferences.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be of sadness at the shutdown, but also of relief at the clarity and ability to keep the focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia, and in other situations.
The communication resources team is working on creating a page in Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Staying up to date on topics related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with whatever it takes.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email and all other information related to COVID-19 in the company wiki.
The communication resources team will update these pages and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a core workflow, or the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, be sure to notify it and work with the communication resources team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive subject, send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandonment of our work and obligations.
They are, however, an acknowledgment that, at this time, our work and obligations will likely need to adapt in ways we haven’t adapted to in the past.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to support at this time, so that we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world with the service they depend on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably, months ahead.
We need all of you for this to happen, so we need all of you to take care of yourself and your family so that they are in their best condition when they need to be.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!

The angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and elevating Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug aimed at treating cardiovascular disease. ECA2 also works as a point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and a C-terminal amino acid and cholectrine transporter domain in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-pass type 1 membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of the main pulmonary alveolar cells of type II, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight to ECA.
ACE cleaves the type I hormone angiotensin into type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn cleaves carboxyterminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-Hhe).
ECA2 also cleaves several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the primary entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of SARS-CoV spike protein S1 and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosomas located within cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the serine-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to hypothesize that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help in fighting infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing with the standard of ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls.”
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with a lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of the 24-hour effects (duration).
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications to help monitoring in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Various frameworks for creating contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues have been raised, especially about systems based on tracking the geographical location of users of the application.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with a person carrying COVID-19.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be ceded to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and offer a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government declared that the contact tracking app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar app is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand plan applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential absence of effectiveness if the acceptance of the application is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful “coronavirus” apps, Apple sets limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them only to “official” or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should prevent further discrimination and marginalisation;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for by law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and citizens’ rights to respond to abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters ohne Grenzen (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its device operating systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created to use central servers only for intercom (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a unique app, the system gathered tracking information from multiple sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate text message warnings for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government also made location information publicly available, which is allowed due to sweeping changes to information confidentiality laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralized one.
By April 6, 2020, the details had not yet been released.
Privacy-preserving contact tracking is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography dating back to at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-respecting solutions, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinating effort that encompasses both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN)
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during the collection and use of location or path crossing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication "Apps Play Dirty: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a push that develops privacy technologies and originally founded on the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and managers, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that came together around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of warning and tracking applications, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government application, became open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control mobile platforms Android and iOS, announced a contact tracking initiative, in which they claimed they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system provides for implementation in three stages:
development of tools to allow the government to create official coronavirus tracking applications while preserving privacy
integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to address persistent and assumed surveillance issues by first distributing the system by running system updates, and later removing it in the same way as soon as the threat ends.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug repositioning, re-profiling, reassignment, or therapeutic substitution) is the repositioning of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a transfusion of convalescent plasma and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drugable proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these binding points provides the reasonable design for the development of antiviral drug effective against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that he then perfected and analyzed for their structural similarities with the more similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in his preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical trial design.
Chloroquine is a malaria drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from New York state would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an Emergency Use Authorization (EAU).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized through the AUE only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors said they are using the drug when “there is no other option.”
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine preventive use.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a Wuhan study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence to support the drug is sparse and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to stock it up and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for the Trump administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about targeting resources to repropose drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir exhibited in vitro antiviral activity against phylum, pneumonia, paramixo and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which can cause transmissions or more serious diseases.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C occurring for hospitalized and severely ill people with COVID-19: two of them are placebo-controlled (in China and Canada), while the other does not have a control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing for azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclesonide) from the company Teijin, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is underway with 200 patients, to be recruited among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria, to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing lung complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women who are breastfeeding or do not use effective contraception have not been included in the tests.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which has led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients is looking at the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages. The study was announced on April 14, in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable to give new purpose to approved antiviral drugs developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as capable of receiving a new purpose for treating patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab-COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus disease vaccine (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with clinical trials completed, there are several ongoing attempts to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a large spread of the outbreak in 2020, which led to considerable investment and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The Epidemic Preparedness Innovations Coalition’s initiative, CEPI, declared in April that the needs for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 diverse technology platforms being researched and under development during early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The goals of the largest platforms that have advanced to Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). Another 37 have been announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being designed).
A phase I-II test performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (follow in pre-clinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a molecular staple vaccine, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.

On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner at Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine with technology similar to that used for neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a Generex subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that they were initiating a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested on humans “in the next 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington at St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in the western Maryland region, announced that they were working on a vaccine.

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the preclinical trial and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, India’s Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated pace, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a Coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in research in the lab, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian stated that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "large sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, a mRNA-based candidate vaccine currently in preclinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and its candidate for the final vaccine could leave for human testing in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a research consortium for the COVID-19 vaccine involving Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI’s total investment in the development of the COVID vaccine.
CEPI’s other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving sequencing from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Nearly the same period, the Canadian government announced $192 million specifically to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national “vaccine bank” of several new vaccines that could be used if other Coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "The MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines that elicited potent antibody-specific responses to antigens [in the mouse] that were evident to start 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A subsequent randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal specimens, such as the ACE2-transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates a need for containment measures for level 3 biosecurity to manipulate live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have already been tested on non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful model for vaccine development and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed Phase I of human clinical trials, and three others in progress, all of which are virus vector vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as the SARS Coronavirus.
Betacoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have already been cured. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced upon exhalation, they typically fall to the ground or stay on surfaces rather than remain infectious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by polymerase chain reaction of real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for those responsible for its care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend no use, some recommend use and others oblige use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, coughing, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty staying awake, bluish face or lips.
Less common, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed at different percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest tightening and palpitations.
In some, the disease can evolve into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is normally six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The role these asymptomatics play in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who have no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
China’s National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sperm and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Loud speaking releases more droplets than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Science suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside people’s rooms contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted through the air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through the stool, if the risk is believed to be low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before the symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, usually one person infects one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Products with soap degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, disabling it, as well as eliminating it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, while the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with household soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in the alveolar cells type II of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury has been observed in 12% of infected people who have been hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in the serious disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high thanks to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for ACE2-expressing respiratory tract epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic T cells that secrete GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with IL-6 secretory inflammatory monocyte recruitment and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at the necropsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is the polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or cold sample may be used.
Results are usually available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, tests using antibodies (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) were in development but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience with testing has shown that its accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in bilateral multilobar matt glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (thickened lobular septums with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, atypical large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoretroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with too many people, frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with your hands unwashed.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, as well as covering your mouth with the inner side of your elbow if the handkerchief is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public meetings.
The distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from each other.
An effective drug for the prevention of COVID-19 is not known. Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for COVID-19 control is to try to lower the peak of the epidemic, also known as "curve flattening".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
He also recommends using alcohol-based hand antiseptic with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where commercial hand antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is given by means of ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepsis."
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under analysis.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms and in the early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care physicians and U.S. pulmonologists have put together treatment recommendations from various agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risks of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures are being performed that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in insulated rooms for airborne infections (IAIS) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions. The CDC summarizes guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blanket, respirator or face mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to wear respirators instead of face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
They have been designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-described uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure at two levels.
Whether either of these leads to the same benefits for people who are severely ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits that aerosol particles spread, compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in the elderly (those over 60 and especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have sufficient hospital beds per capita, which limits the health system’s ability to cope with the sudden escalation in the number of serious COVID-19 cases enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans that have pressure control mode and high level of PEEP are needed to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung and pneumothorax injuries associated with ventilation.
High PEEP level may not be available on older fans.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials are underway with several antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
While new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, several of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are in the advanced testing stage.
Antiviral medication can be tested in people with various diseases.
The WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in the efficacy and safety tests of potential treatments. The FDA has given temporary authorization for the use of plasma from recovering people as a treatment in cases where the person’s life is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies necessary to show its safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been carried out.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The application can detect “near contact” using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities. Big data mobile analytics, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people they have had contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who are allegedly with coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect people who may come into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect who is discovering the quarantine.
Italy’s regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told by cell phone operators that “40% of people still circulate.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience quarantine difficulties, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “The rise of social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis is a perfect storm to harm people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may have a mild evolution, with few or no symptoms, resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of serious COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 data is missing. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders, and damage to the heart, kidney, and liver.
Clotting disorders, specifically increased prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, whereas renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median manifestation of initial symptoms until death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), men had a 2.8% mortality rate, while women had a 1.7% mortality rate.
Histopathological examinations of lung post-mortem samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung imaging exam looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission, heart damage was detected due to elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of comorbidity mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Under-reporting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be over-estimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive treatment or die, compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about long-term after-effects of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authority found a 20-30 percent drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who have recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by coronavirus-positive tests at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worsening of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin, through overflow infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency disease codes U07.1 for deaths resulting from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, no laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global lethality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) on April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not restricted to time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths should have been formally recorded as such.
In addition, the German healthcare system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had COVID-19 death confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for both men and women.
Mortality is highest in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The biggest risk for men is in their 50s, with the difference between men and women only approaching 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking women and the development by men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking sex-related COVID-19 infection data.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, explained that "CO" is "crown", "VI", "virus", "D", disease and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 was called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “COVID-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19” in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronaviruses".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the "Wuhan coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended “2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease” as interim names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 guidance against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal zaragogues and respirator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on the required schedule, a local startup reverse engineered and printed the 100 necessary valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged, which quickly spread across the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is underway in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY Trial” to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with the most likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the whole virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response from the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 clinical trials underway since April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs makes up the bulk of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries due to a report in late April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There has been an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir by compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA published an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors who treat people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be further studied in vivo after demonstrating low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the protein from the initial spike in preparation for the transmembrane serine 2 protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-storm properties of cytokine. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the completion of a small study.
A non-randomized phase 2 trial is underway in Italy, after demonstrating positive results in people with the serious disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of death for some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of a different cause-induced steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled, randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies specific for this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of strongly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
