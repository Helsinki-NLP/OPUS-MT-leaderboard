Parliament did not ratify the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament has refused, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the proposed annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs rejected at second reading the proposed amendment to reduce penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for concluding an a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the sentenced in December.
Tymosenko called the ruling a political revenge of the regime and provoked a process of suspicions of bias from the court to the west as well.
The proposal to overturn paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 Members of Parliament.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners have yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are the Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals?
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary law of Sharia law and we already know what it is about.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a robbery one cuts off the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, those who do not respect the faith are punishable by capital punishment...
It is the Qur'an that will unite society composed of opposing tribes in the place of the personality of the dictator.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot represent and as we surely would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly astonishing that Islamist warriors accepted aid with gratitude from unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with every attack.
When it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam and our poilitics turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "cruises".
Without land use, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
As long as we do not allow these followers of Shariah.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states published GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market breaks all records.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, while France's GDP is projected to grow by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better positioned than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the 0.1% forecast), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was at the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that we are moving towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts’ predictions.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter according to the forecast and periodically recalculated data.
The eurozone and European Union economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The yield on 10-year bonds is 28.45%
Bond yields from Spain and Italy are climbing to critical limits.
Problems are beginning to be felt in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
Yields on Czech bonds remain below 4% as the situation worsens in the region.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should be the guarantee of last resort .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate qualifying for 200 million
The representation of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also defended with a good deal of luck in the second half and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with detailed reporting.
No particular excitement during the first half and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification in the European Championship.
The Montenegrins found themselves under pressure even in the second half because of a precise Czech defense.
The vicitmes of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent in the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the chest of Czech football.
From the first few minutes, we played football.
Both teams found it difficult to mount combinations and the game focused mainly around the centerline.
The pressure from the national footballers did not manage to break through the Czech defense, which responded accurately to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred college students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan created a human shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology center where uranium is processed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest report that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at destroying Iran’s nuclear program, the targets would be not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The feeding of an obese child: does not take breakfast and takes cold cuts for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, 9% of schoolchildren will be overweight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the patterns that surround it are.
On the tables of obese children, for example, charcuterie is found 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to survey conducted with awareness-raising action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of big kids, sports is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today - only 15% answered that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic participated.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever company.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from the sixth to the third grade have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children who are overweight, even obese, is the lack of proper diet and not enough physical exercise.
“Only half of the children surveyed say eating breakfast five times a day – in case – lunch – tasting – dinner, which is a basic principle of a good diet,” says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and cold meats for dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes a few basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students’ families eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
And the worst that's been reported is that one-tenth of the population doesn't have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthy fries are more often consumed.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children surveyed exercise regularly but for parents this is half, only 15%.
Prepare Your Food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
“The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal, in terms of healthy eating.”
Among their favorite dishes are lots of cakes, meats and sweets.
“The most alarming is notably a high preference for sweet lemonades,” the survey results indicate.
For lunch it was the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
The children did not want starches at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Heading to Health
The survey also showed that children are willing to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the "Obesity is not a coincidence" awareness session, there was a determined willingness to move towards a healthy diet," the survey results indicate.
The most notable was for example with regard to sweet lemonades as children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often ticked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as their main course and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour pellets or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn’t think about what would happen next.
Presentations by three professionals of the specialty, character dress and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it is really "stuffed".
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) dealt with how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, no particular curve, another of overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically reduce wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We came to beautifully emphasize the character and also not to dress too prominently of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between the waist and the hips in such a way that skirts or trousers do not pass at all, it is worth making it to yourself.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is invaluable.
In a bespoke skirt you will feel much better than in the one that constantly slips, winds up and doesn’t fit around the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford Tucker style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that with regard to what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We have to take into account the current appearance, the type of personality fashion as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress up" Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know about the Victoria Secret campaign.
Deep down, it makes me happy, because it’s better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost 100 kilos lately (don’t take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work the graphics.
Moodboard, as they say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist does not dress in this way only the physique but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (on given products the trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, has kept us on board with all of this.
But this...until Sunday
The stylist must have an overview
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse look to Saturday's session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka, fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with only one outfit in a different way.
Variability is a prime example.
Like for example this trench coat that should be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with shoes and take a photo like a dress.
Or just pull up the sleeves or collar and immediately get a new look.
“Play with that,” he said.
But I particularly enjoyed the advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
“You can then start contravening it,” Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why you try to learn these rules, what to do with them, what to do with them, why, while sometimes you see something else in fashion magazines.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben, that the stylist must have much more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have about ten pages (so about ten models) I have to be ready to "cut" at least about fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to count on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make up half the success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists is still frigid.
And known faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seem to pass in the second row).
And if someone gets a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he dictates to us with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then it remains for us to navigate on google and make sure if the boulevard info report the celebrity in question, if it has lost weight or grown up etc...
Honza and Mario put us on the heart Sunday that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he dresses, so it’s important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
“When a manager asks you to sort out her wardrobe and fill it with new items, you can’t throw it all away and say, ‘Oh, my God, what a horror.’
"You'll find some things that you'll find pretty and he'll advise you with what to wear," Mario says.
This one has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It’s the one you hang around your waist and have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, hair removal rollers or nurse pins, there is also nylon yarn (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple can not be used).
In order for us to be not only people who listen but have tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly reseem shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could damage, for the most part outdoors.
And so we glued and glued.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently injure ourselves.
So we really need skills.
Mario was pleased when he congratulated me on my creation.
The contempt I'm mentioning is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of class
I am beginning to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run competes across America.
Revision
Originally a race without problem is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do in a routine morning commute to work.
It fulfills everyone’s ambition to a certain extent, but it’s useless if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitled part The Run produced high expectations before its release.
It promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed racing series and to release a kind of game from the playable games that would not be counted with just points.
So we were curious about how the added passages will be in which the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As it is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what we expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole thing pulls down because of a few unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of incomprehensible laziness on the part of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has characteristic problems and to fix them starts to participate in illegal races throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race is done on another route and the stages planned in different environments that stand out from each other quite well and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also pretty nice even if the graphical technical level is the same as the previous series.
This is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very visually pleasing.
The tests are also occasionally decorated with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Besides that, the different races are well arranged one after the other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments you strive to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you will race against the watch (classic duel with the chronometer) and then again you are waiting for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police entering the game and trying to make the situation difficult.
The novelty is the off-vehicle passages.
Rather, it’s an interactive animation when Jack mostly runs away in front of someone and you have to help him by tapping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer times of this type than you expect (to be specific there are only three).
As a result, it is like this because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that embellish the game.
The driving pattern is in the tradition of the previous games.
Which means that at the moment there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said to be negative.
When it comes to realistic simulation, you’ll need to look elsewhere.
But although we can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything is okay.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
In contrast to the model of driving, that of collisions is not yet at the point.
We don't expect complicated deformation and collisions from this game, but when you don't have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, so it's not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your self goes into crazy volts.
Or it is in crumbs.
Thanks to the reboot system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you have broken the figure or you have gone out into the setting the game brings you back to the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and you have to find the solution by remembering from memory the piece of route in question.
The great thing about this game is that the same actions are in the same places.
For example, there are certain corners that you have to pass in a certain way or else it does not happen.
Otherwise, you will encounter "civilian" vehicles in the same configuration as if you were arriving first, fifth, 5 seconds early or one minute late.
What makes you angry is the situations when you see the opponent easily pass between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and circumvent them or brake them.
It doesn’t matter if you go in front of it because it is “calculated” in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about the weather, and you always have the same opponent ahead of you in the same place.
This irritates the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long deck in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes you it hides the view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a good many times.
It can be understood that the goal of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And that’s a shame because through a simple driving pattern the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don’t have time to follow everything that happens.
And it doesn’t matter if it’s because of the concept of 50 unique itineraries, that the order of the races is such that there’s no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You have to pay attention to the petrol pumps on the routes as you can change cars but most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for straight highways and super exotic sports cars on very technical drives for example on lacing roads in the mountains.
And the challenge mode, which are racing in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main regime of the story.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with Autolog, which compares your results with those of other players and gives you other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult moves to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you ride in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (in advance) and behind you comes a subway train that sends you the car directly to the scrap.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought when creating this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is as a rule nice and in some cases really great.
What is embarrassing is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not hold up and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true for accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer of any use to you.
The sound part is good and the track is your choice.
In order to please as many people and especially the youngest audience a new soundtrack was created in the style of "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
Overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confusing.
If the game didn’t have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game feels like it’s not over.
The fun is really good but be prepared for the mistakes to hit you in the eyes with the force of an aerodrome reflector.
The Velvet Students in concert with the choirs of Charles University

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a hard war.”
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," said Milena Vicenova, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, in a statement.
When she managed to describe the different EU bodies and their relationships in such a comprehensible and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers from Charles University’s Faculty of Law could envy her, she showed how much she takes her motto “understandably and openly about Europe” very seriously.
Ms Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
“From the beginning, there was criticism that he is ugly, that he is a leather-rounder, that he cannot fulfill any mission and I have to say that he has taken everyone’s breath away because he plays his role to perfection.”
“He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, how to communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction Europe needs to take.”
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", thus as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater legibility of the Union's policy vis-à-vis states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency a success two years ago.
The Czechs solved the looming financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She called the government’s downfall very negative and damaged the Czech Republic’s image.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has been in full swing" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved even now.
In addition, we must approve the new Union septimal budget, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be thin and with a view to saving, which branch will take priority, which countries will be helped the most, at least, everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted pickles, bananas that are different sizes or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky.
She wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the EU institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, Czechs have a reputation for being eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative aspects more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
She believes that the fault is the result of several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a cover letter and the lack of support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?' and he's not at all happy."
According to Vicenova, in the near future, tough new fiscal policy rules are awaiting member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
“We have countries in the eurozone and countries outside the eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation.”
In the first place it was said that the countries that want to cooperate with each other and those that don’t want to stay in their corner.”
“There will be a lot of institutes of this kind and there will be a truly two-speed Europe,” Vicenova said.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis according to which all the themes having an impact on the EU should be discussed among all EU members and not only the members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
The IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the word that most closely expresses the IBM strategy, the closest one would be “the long term.”
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm’s first chief executive, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved as long as people are willing to think.
His slogan "THINK!" became the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
It was the foundation of Watson’s carefully crafted corporate culture.
For us, IBM means long-term thinking of continuous forward-looking movements.
IBM survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it always remained true to its core values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more," said the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began caring for his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only American employees to have paid for vacations, insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-crafted system of rewards for inventors and merchants.
Similarly, IBM has a well-designed customer relationship system.
The company was at first brilliant at discovering talent – as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus had a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman – Virginia Rometty – who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has worked at IBM for 30 years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
Over the past few years, IBM has been doing what we call jamy, online brainstorming, from which a lot of future strategies and innovations have come.
No wonder he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are almost 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a safe position in the business field.
“From the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology,” said Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM – or the “Great Blue,” as it is familiarly called in the United States with regard to its slogan – in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services from server products to nanotechnology.
She holds numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of her employees have been awarded a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are for example the cash machine, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the floppy disk.
IBM ended up this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example has not managed to bet on an OS/2 own operating system, the online Prodigy service or the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the forward movement you cannot emotionally stay hooked on the past," Palmisano said.
For this reason IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it leaves.
Unlike, for example, the competitor Microsoft that at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are formed for one-fifth by software and hardware, have a leading place.
However still in 1990 it was with more than the strongest participation motif representative of hardware.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during which time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology prospects.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it overcame the new financial crisis .
IBM trades according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
Does it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis unconcerned?
The IBM share price projected from 2008 on into a 120 percent rocket, the firm's net profit continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to handle other crises.
IBM History: From slices of cheese to flights into the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80s of the tenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the firm’s founder – the company’s identity and culture have so far been based on Watson’s ideas.
Watson ran the Kusqu firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson’s leadership, revenue increased to $9 million and the company began expanding in all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable to the firm that after 40 years of management it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos – on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time under the name IBM 5150 came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been successful at IBM over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept.
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
In terms of commerce IBM recently developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps marketers manage the entire trading cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno’s strategic outsourcing center.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it’s over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for the future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova asylum in the summer in her house, she did not know that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not reject the singer.
He confessed in public that he loved him.
Over time Darina resigned herself, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartsova separate there will be no wife to welcome her on the doorstep of the house.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out.”
“He will no longer be my beloved and lost old ass, but a man with whom I have a special relationship,” Rychtarova said, showing that she has separated from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is no problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I will stay with Iveta and not change.”
“My wife has set up a wedding on paper and I respect it.”
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we talk completely normal but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop it.
“We don’t sleep together and I’m not interested in knowing where she’s going, with whom and if she has a relationship.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take all the responsibility," concluded Joseph.
Women’s worst vices: Does it matter to you too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all of them, both of them, are able to get them out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of feminine vices that manage to pump the blood from the veins of men.
Purchasing
Does half of you say you are addicted to purchases?
Do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy and in packages at the time of sales?
In your case, we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, who would resist the window-shopping of clothing stores, to look for yourself for nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become for men a real hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve told your spouse he’s waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
“I would need to lose at least 5 pounds – should I start exercising?”
"Do you like me?"
Don’t these phrases remind you of anything?
Yeah?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the issue that you should stop taking care of yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about her appearance.
The strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become poisonous.
Cleanliness and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless ride.
Washing windows, vacuuming, cleaning floors, dusting, stripping the bathroom - and that twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he is walking with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have soiled the sink, soiled the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you are suffering from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put this worn sweater in the trash."
"Are you going to put on those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this digging job on your partner several times a day, you’re really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much digging work...
Defamation, Persiflage
Defamation, persiflage, but also insults against someone are also typical of some women.
Women are especially drawn to relationships and so are content to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets out a little harmless stalking here and there.
The hand on the heart is a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persevere, even despise others and are especially dangerous for their surroundings – especially at work in a women’s collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey forward Jagr participated twice in the Philadelphia victory during Monday's NHL ice game in Caroline and is again leading the productive Czech players for the contest.
From the point of view of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who again made one more pass and was named the best player of the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told reporters across the Atlantic that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
“Sometimes that feeling falls on you,” Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers’ first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the palette and presented it to scorer Maxime Talbot.
One second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second half belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically to Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said of his center.
“I never thought I would play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him.”
“I’m really happy with that.”
“I want to play on him.”
“All these years in the NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it’s my turn,” Jagr said.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended in two-on-one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area."
“He hit the pallet, I picked up speed and (Read) went to the furthest corner of the cage.
“I tried to hit him and I got there,” describes the game’s final goal from his point of view.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo he came out in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candidates didn't stand up to an experienced defender their two-way butt they lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than losing fists as they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It's nothing."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to do, that's how it is," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement was not enough and we couldn't resist."
“We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our area.”
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, a Czech defender, took part in the 30th attack on Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly in the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a westward inclination and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist bloc (also for Czechoslovakians) to travel individually even within the framework of socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovakian citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but you had to queue up all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good acquaintance" within the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn’t won yet.
The currency deal that was the condition for traveling west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who couldn't travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs were buying and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989, Czech travel has undergone a major revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their peak, Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The removal of visas in the 90s of the last century in the western neighbouring countries has caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical trait of a Czech trip at that time was to take with you your own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average salary increased which caused around the year 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter connections that through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
At the end of the 1990s the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world apart from the US, which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008 the EU removed visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully fit into the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time ever again in history spent more than 15,000 kronor per person for holidays abroad including ancillary charges.
The General Assembly must find its President but this may end in a situation without a solution "one pat"
Nearly 5 months of Czech football is already without a president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Czech Football Association is not yet known after another General Assembly that is scheduled to take place Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on what voting rules should be applied.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did football go back to divergences between the Association's chambers that could not agree on a common candidate.
This was completely demonstrated on September 16 when it was necessary to choose a new president.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was not even a question of dealing with how to elect.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, statutory representatives or also officials with full powers.
In this one point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the help also of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Divergences continue over the election rules.
It is too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also brought nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nerves remain the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The apple of discord lies in the fact that either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Football Association Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model wins in the third round the candidate who will have received the most votes in percentage in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to be withdrawn to win the candidate who will have received the highest percentage of votes of the two chambers.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
“Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely deny the bicameral concept,” admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian party and who better not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the rules of the elections established according to the statutes benefit the most Pelta among all the candidates.
“I want to vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association.”
"So that there are not yet any sluggish ideas imagined by a representative like in the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a first-time candidate and who in his presentations defined himself especially against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
"Qualifying today in the European Championship should calm everyone down."
“Football will once again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more drive for cooperation,” added the Jablonec officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in managing football both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
“I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense.”
“It’s not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations.”
“This can again cause a blockage in the General Assembly.”
“I still hope that healthy reason will win,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell if the entire direction of football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee to the retaliatory field.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parties in the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union that must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to fight for the position of President because he does not see any correct candidates.
If Plzen’s head of footballers Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigning for this high position.
“If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I don’t stand for election.”
“But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate,” Paclik told the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl for precisely trying to prevent Pelta from getting to the head of the AFRT which would a priori be given favorite for this election.
Paclik also points out that in the event that he wins the elections he would hold the position of President only until 2013, the year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in the role an experienced and high-level manager but who is not related to the world of football.
“I’ve talked to people who would have the profile,” he said.
“For me it was terrible when some people told me they didn’t want to be identified with Czech football at the moment.”
“I would like to change that image,” he added.
What, it is said, particularly embarrasses Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of the delegates' General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold the position of President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying merchant, it would be even less supportive of football," Paclik said.
What shocked him again was the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago during wiretapping in an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta left without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago, "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen."
Should Paclik win Thursday's vote, he should prove he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
“He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with.”
“He has great capabilities.”
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he wouldn't be able to."
“I’m not putting my nose into what I don’t know,” said Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he spoke out for the cancellation of the Referees’ Commission with Ludek Macela, which replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to run private companies and that he also runs the club of Plzen since last year, which celebrated with his support in May last year his triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it.”
"I would curb the influence of certain interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik, who does not express his dislike for Sparta leader Daniel Kretinsky.
He would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power with high-level policies would allow for more money for sport from the gaming tax.
“That’s one of the key points that the new president should be addressing.”
“If it’s the gambling tax as the political parties state, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT president should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"It's not the ideal."
I don’t see any reason to pass on my actions from the Plzen club to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should end pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidate Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future the disputes about the settlement for the elections.
The Jablonec official is ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believes that today's success of the football performance should calm that guerrilla war before the vote.
Pelta before the September election that did not take place promised precisely to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last minute just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay could well allow him to defend his vision of leadership in football and to present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday.”
“They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association,” he adds, but he is primarily connected with the club of Jablonec, who has worked for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That’s also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly statutes were approved that were not as perfect as they all realized."
“If there weren’t all these various interpretations, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that caught the full attention of the delegates.
“If I become president, I take it as my personal mission and I’m ready to take full responsibility for it if it doesn’t work out.”
"This is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl, which he recognizes with regard to his legal training, and that he is well aware that his opponent-candidate will be his first Vice-President.
Nor has he long attacked Tonas Paclik who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
“He’s been playing football for a year and he’s had a few successes.”
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta told his opponent but remains, he says, true to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to the national representation.
It should be a win for football.
"And I would also try to end all the cases that begin with that of the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sectors so that we can get enough money for all the football," the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring any change in people.
“I should get to know all the employees,” he told Strahov, where understandable nervousness has reigned since there was no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“If there’s one point of contention about how to vote in the third round, we’ll be able to outdo it.”
“Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head,” Pelta optimistically says two days before the day that is likely to determine his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT would start working hard
"If current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association at Thursday's General Assembly it would not appeal to many people, it seems.
Rajchl promises, however, that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wants to make systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I want to take care of football as a whole.”
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and youth-friendly football."
“But I’m not saying I’ll do all this alone,” Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
“I’m a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific area.”
“And I’m going to be distributing difficult missions so that football can take a big step forward.”
“Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting hard work rather than criticizing others,” he added.
He stated, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
“About me, I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if it's worth it and if I have people behind me who will keep putting sticks in my wheels and cast doubt on each of my actions," he said.
“A lot of people have told me I don’t have to give up because they would give up too.”
“It’s a trust I can’t betray,” he says.
What motivates him, it is also said, is to continue the work begun with Hasek.
“For the last two years there has been a lot of work in fact and I don’t want to let it go.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something that Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
"Behind him are people who would play football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen."
“You can blame me for a number of things, but I’m sure you can’t put up with one.”
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to play football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only with those who have been chosen.
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for Czechia.
“And if there are those who say otherwise, I’m willing to do my best for Moravia.”
“For example, it is time to consider the second division being divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose victors would end up in the first division.”
“There would be no situation like currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
“I constantly feel the support of the Czech House that has elected me its Vice President and knows that with me there will be successes,” said Rajchl, who envisions among his future successes saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, negotiations on contracts with televisions and on the game law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
“No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year.”
“If elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would make no noticeable change among the people in the Commissions.”
“He wouldn’t want to spoil his successes,” said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.

UFO-optic pools, beautiful pools of Budapest: Who travels through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after having toured the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in soda baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the last 18 months, there is one thing that should not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked at the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that were waiting for her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor pool pleased her, she immediately noted in her notebook all the interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreiheiten (Bathing Jewels). The municipal indoor swimming pools of München, the historic bathing palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She has conducted her "travels to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
Meder explains that she doesn’t have much interest in the sport but he feels attracted to the water in a totally different way.
It's annoying that swimmers should just look at blue tiles and settle for the stench of bleach while joggers breathe in the scent of bewitching spruce forests or can hear the buzz of happy park birds.
"I once wondered why the pools should always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water reinforces the architecture doubly
A swim in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real treat for the eyes: "Instead of a floor you have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It's transparent on one side, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building on the other side."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, stepping stones.
The small image volume "Badefreiheitn" makes a 190-page interesting report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to take a leap into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Next to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of baths whose pools are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in a sezberían find).
On the other hand, the heated outdoor pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While you have the whole city in your eyes from one roof of the Zurich bath, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can see the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background rises the Ötztal mountains towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of bleach does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulfur, the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The odor comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its sludge sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool – a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded plot of land.
The bath designed by the architect Dushan Jurkovic in 1902 was in the meantime closed.
Taking a look through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the blossoming of weeds between the tiles.
She observed the opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad’s thermal bath palace.
This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have come out since its design in 1844 but also a Moorish room in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favourite bath of pool expert Iris Meder - and not only because it is native to Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a great achievement to merge such different building styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural Speculation
German bank examines commodity speculation in detail
Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on commodities?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the group leader then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg - Airport
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that stock market speculation on global commodities is pushing prices upwards and that banks share an accomplice to the global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is aligned against the head of the Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Commodity speculation was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the opinion that bettors have detached themselves from the offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted differently to criticism from U.S. competitors: He promised to investigate the allegations and said, "no case is worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at stake."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining Foodwatch-Report’s allegations.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of directors of Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how much today's banks are harming the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly obligated today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank said on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything that is planned within the Board of Directors.
He could improve his brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And when it comes to possible losses, he has little to worry about – his successor will worry about it.
One in two would terminate investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only eleven percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many customers of the bank would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their entourage, 49% replied that they would think about terminating their account to change their banking institution.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and acts as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about modern post-war architecture, its clear shapes, its glass sheds, its bright and bold looks and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the world exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its lightweight and suspended steel and glass construction.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture to this day.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian world exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at Vienna’s South Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the artworks, so not a good environment.
However it was used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has become increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "Maison du 21ème siècle" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect.
The new start was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career in her youth as an art skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she has particularly carried out the work of transformation with politicians and monumental protection, she has obtained public funds and sponsorship.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba, whose foundation bears the same name, have been exhibited, a café and a bookstore are located there, and an office is to be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensibly transformed and expanded Joseph Olbracht's secession and he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and his change of use.
In the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was "a gulf of energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, fiberglass-reinforced insulating glass was installed and the roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridge beams have been reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a panel of dimmed light between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - this is almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remained, the house is painted in a shade of red-brown rust protection.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also please the monuments protection office," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to raw soil in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City" story.
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance shot of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the newly planned "central station district" with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city in order to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a multi-million-dollar winter crisis package.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend in this regard more than 70 million more this year.
The Bild-Zeitung newspaper previously reported, citing an internal crisis plan of the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway installations and docks is expected to double to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the docks of snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track devices needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Station Chief Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway society had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had years of work to do, as it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked much more often in the workshop, after an axle rupture took place on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
German bank Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this giant of the sector catches up more in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Markets Regulator is bringing a whole series of charges to big banks that would have led cooperative banks to make false promises about buying financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost tremendous value during the financial crisis and drove banks down.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties initiating proceedings in court," a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York said.
In comparison, the Bank did not admit any faults.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed concessions from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks aside and in the summer he sued JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Regarding the issue of mortgage documents it is about "Mortgage-backed Securities".
The credit unions are at the root of this.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, at the moment there is a stormy wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisors have taken numerous remedies to seek redress or to sanction breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She accuses 18 major international banks, two U.S. state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of benefiting in kind from about $200 billion in mortgage deals.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA for several transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities are demanding that Frankfurter answer for “substantial losses” but without citing a specific sum.
Deutsche Bank dismissed the claims as unjustified and said it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett Increases by $10 Billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests huge sums in IBM’s IT business.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not investing in IT companies, given that the long-term evolution of companies shows only bad predictions.
However, he read IBM’s reports and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers IT services and systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
A Warren Buffett investment is considered a knightly attack on the world of finance.
As a result, IBM's IT business now has the right to be called "Mr. IBM".
Buffett revealed on CNBC that he has been buying IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM has never heard of this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been focusing for some time on IT services as the operation of accounting centers.
The IT pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both software and consulting as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
But instead Buffett is attacking the railroad, lubricant or machine manufacturers.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a number of major groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
This 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM shares increased by one percent on the stock exchange.
“Big Blue,” as IBM also calls itself, has a total market value of more than $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn’t want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even talks about a “bloody ideology”, which would now be reborn.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks the spectre that had long been thought dead has reappeared: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this extreme right-wing context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany has never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology?" "That was the title of the online publication of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The Sabah newspaper, however, points out that one of the perpetrators was a v-man of the Constitutional Protection, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right mud.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted in a rational way: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony on the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports from some Turkish media have the effect of a slap: “Germany’s gift for the fiftieth anniversary” is the title of an article on the Turkish platform “Haber X”, which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of deriving unambiguous conditions.
"It's starting to smell," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He points out that people were murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and these had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it hasn’t come to the minds of German authorities much earlier to do research in some suspicious right-wing circles, the authors are astonished.
More than one is prepared for at least rhetorical or even drastic means: “If the case continues to be sloppy, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defense and armament.”
“It will be the best self-defense.”
"The internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the pertinence of the punishment of the entire network," Selen writes.
What this means if domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The picture of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, to what distrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks have, however, heightened the sense of self in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks which the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech at the time, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if a man's value could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many Germano-Turks has been towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time around.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has in the meantime slipped from one crisis to the next.
It's a German who has to lead now.
That’s certainly not what Axel Weber imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was learned in July that he would hold an almost as spectacular position in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss major bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, hailed; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently obtained solidity and passed kind remarks on future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded in the Turnaround."
"I look forward to the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS stock trader in London had hijacked all of the Bank’s security systems and burned about €1.7 billion.
The head of the UBS board of directors Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
of the UBS Board of Directors has since been regarded as suffering - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board as early as May – not 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adjustment.
Suddenly he took responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, UBS is huge on one side – until recently, it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other, it has been skating for years from one scandal to the other.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, quiet and solid, but also cunning, she had combined with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
“In today’s world, we’re asking ourselves: how could I have just been so wrong?”
He was profoundly mistaken.
In 2007 it turned out that for the first time something was wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli surprisingly retired, who was considered to be a top intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later I realized why he was gone.
The division of the bank had flared with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross on billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this she actually found investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed over in silence, to the point that its name was never even learned.
But that was only the first shot.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank was once again expected to announce billions in losses, with the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrawing.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its investment mistakes, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank has bought tens of billions of troubled securities from the UBS, while the Swiss Confederation has donated six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to house such big banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 amounted to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
“We couldn’t save the UBS again,” says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, it was followed by the second.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the affluent clientele, who had cheated the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unwarranted profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS more or less published that it had helped with tax fraud.
At the same time she has lost something that has always been her capital in competition with wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus the bank had lost its credibility in a few months in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid in tax fraud.
And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as it was thought, that the UBS would get away with it, it followed this unfortunate story of title dealers: a single title dealer burns 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And we publish: with risk management in investment banking it still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, we have seen that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
So the chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure: "the UBS problem is that it does not have risk control in hand."
However, it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long assumed their function, that of becoming guardians of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich goes hand in hand with the strong cliché of the Swiss private bank – it’s only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from Zurich Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's can be found here among the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
We arrive at the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered in marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day turned away from the market – or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, he finds - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would have spread further.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And yet they have long adapted to the ways of Anglo-Saxons."
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book The UBS Crash.
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks formed a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and it has been continuously growing.
What helped was that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS completed: a rich but lethargic bank with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer one, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great, modest intellectual, who understands it very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has made his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli until the end.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought his models were reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remembers the leaders’ meetings during which the Wuffli Group leader always spoke the same slogan: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which documented the success of the banks at that time.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In terms of currency and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
The corporate advisors, who had the responsibility, however, pointed out one weakness: in international interest operations, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
The UBS would have shortcomings in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Desperate for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packed and passed on valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages – but which has also kept risks.
Even when other banks had been looking to go down for a long time.
"Still in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," Geiger said.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved more difficult than previously thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and are so far bankable.
The man who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: ending investment banking, concentrating on asset management, returning to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t want to go that far.
But investment banking must atrophy vigorously, as far as is clear so far.
Next Thursday, the head of the bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank split with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has imposed himself: he must conduct the UBS business on a sustainable basis, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring investment banking back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are certainly the questions that Axel Weber has already asked himself.
He said publicly so far only that he was going to pick up an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe over the weekend has discouraged US investors.

Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, only confirmed this caution: “It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do anything to end the crisis,” he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle at the winds and entered the American technology industry.
Its investment of more than $10 billion in IBM has supported the stock price of this traditional group, and allowed it to score almost more than 1%, against the trend of commercial management.

Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, freus are considered a "bird problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals have not been allowed to hunt cities for a long time.
Some people love them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplying due to the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote to the "°bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to drive freus out of cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
Protectors of nature based the problems of cities also on the exodus of particularly protected freux: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional living spaces.
Hunting, planting and felling typical hatching trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 hatching pairs in the Westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity due to the slaughter of horns in this region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with sticks particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, eviction, is useless," said Leer city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
Destruction of nests using water under pressure or cutting down trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals are moving away, large colonies are dividing and they are dispersing in other places."
Eviction is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of evicting animals to an aversive packaging and eye-catching offers, in order to allow them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospected "information panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-Training-Educational Baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing the lives of these highly intelligent freus.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of noise caused by birds: "Here's a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Freux not only use working instruments to get to a feast but they themselves make their tools as working instruments.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge were testing four freus recently, how far the intelligence of birds is coming.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized that a stone must have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning crows then had to solve a tougher problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their loot with their beaks.
However, the researchers had put pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four are successful from the very beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a Bosnian and Turkish coup remained unsuccessful.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the playoffs at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and knocked out Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal misled Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after 0:0 of the game, their fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the play-back game by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was more hot in Turkey's 0:0 draw against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other draws for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic with an 11-meter penalty played by hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was faced with a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a 30-meter free kick forward into the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her remote shooting qualities and fired at a distance of 25 meters to do 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half-hour did nothing, had their first clear luck thanks to forward Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship of Manchester City initiated a headball directed towards the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attention.
After an attack against Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other side, Stark awarded an 11-meter penalty played by controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 vice-champion of Europe managed four strokes and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the cross had to come to the rescue of the already shot Czech world-class goalkeeper, once again, the forward of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the Zagreb football miracle during this time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the 2002 EM third bench, the Croats were able to enjoy their fourth round in the European Championship final.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long range shot only the post, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd Minute, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had already taken over with a 4:0 success the first stage for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed to the top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defense was able to prevent a possible goal from the first-scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and squeezed the ball onto the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” said CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
To date, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this rapidly expanding country.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase revenues to €20 billion in 2015.
Last year, Walldorfer posted revenue of almost 12.5 billion euros.
Currently the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked so well.
SAP has been active in China for over 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our business (...),” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information.”
The personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a long list of characters that cling to your heart.
A tip to get started: tear this page down carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in detail. In this novel by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the haze of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book which he accurately describes as "a work of anti-history."
It has some well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors or discussions about strategies and materials.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a “book describing what it might look like.”
“Beauty and sorrow” summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulancemen and vendors.
Some will become heroes.
Some will lose limbs, go crazy, or lose their lives.
Their lives are wavering here like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are lit.
Peter Englund's book deviates from traditional history books.
It brings a denial to the idea that World War I can only be summed up by the terrible trench war on the Western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that stinks the rope.
When gunshots sound in the distance, and you’re a home mom, do you stay or run away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts has been compounded by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"Beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly taken from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them deal with deprivation and the ability to get away with it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He is currently working on alternative food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from cooked rice crushed into sheep's fat (and finished with a fake wood bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
He states that "837 permitted substitute meats are registered in sausage production. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive toward savagery and declares of war: "You feel that after all this is what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky by hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no beard behind it.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is very likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
“When you’re resigned to sacrifice, you hope to have an audience,” he writes.
It is, unfortunately, rather like “a convicted man strangled in secret.”
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“Conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the early century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as there are heroism.
Peter Englund talks about the soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
“We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread over the genitals in hopes of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
“The most desperate people apply it to their eyes, which translates into lifelong blindness.”
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps how the war “triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are waging war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory," or Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West," rather than complete.
The work of Peter Englund is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I’ve read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it was as if he had come up from his book, grabbed this page with your hands where the list of people is listed and burned with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen as Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the outset that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not be rehearsals of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which went against the department’s settlement and spawned a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean up Zuccotti Park from its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the course of the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was held on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better anti-riot training – anti-terrorist measures that involve quickly displacing large numbers of police officers – to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders given to move around the park came “at the last minute,” said one accustomed, referring to the operation as “a simple exercise.”
“The few police officers I know who were called didn’t know they were going to Zuccotti Park,” the person said.
“The only ones who know they’d go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy.”
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police officers wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighborhood – dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people would come and go to the park during the day, in the manner of migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was necessary to proceed when the park had the fewest people," he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The recorded lights and messages ringing from the speakers appeared to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were hit before 1:45 a.m., police said, giving occupants time to collect their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the police department’s chief, said the move was for security purposes only.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly retained by the officers.
Browne said the TV camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the protesters’ thick business wreckage, including luggage, plastic lawn and bags of sheets filled with clothes, sanitation department teams followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were released on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hung up together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services have been called to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation was completed about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Mostly for “disorder to public order and rebellion.”
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most senior officer to have been on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of policemen waited along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if needed.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as Pine Street, south.
We have seen the police expand the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the hood of a police car, and others were spotted puncturing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood emerged flying from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The school aid union sues the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory layoffs, with a disproportionate impact on schools hosting underprivileged schoolchildren.
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, 37th District Council, in an attempt to have the layoffs canceled.
Six hundred and seventy-two school workers, parents' coordinators and other employees, among the lowest paid in the city, lost their jobs on Oct. 7, when union leaders compared the layoffs to political vengeance for not allowing the city access to a health care fund run by workers' groups, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
Municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council replied, mentioning that the dismissals of school grants were not specified in the budget.
The officers of the 37th District Council said they would fill out a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits to the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's Department of Education will be the defendant, and the complainants will be represented by eight dismissed female workers, all of black or Latin American origin, like most school workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of layoffs in schools in the city’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and barely a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school workers have lost their jobs in Brownsville's 23rd District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school workers at Harlem’s 36th Public School, where 68 percent of schoolchildren live in poverty, the lawsuits state that “It’s not a neighborhood of affluent parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget gap.”
The budget of public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each underprivileged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents’ coordinators.
The memo used the term "overtaking" to describe the action, although "overtaking" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six coordinators of parents have been dismissed", and "not only because of overtaking".
Mission complete: Congress agrees on Libya issue
It would eventually appear that Republicans and Democrats had reached an agreement on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and U.S. troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution is about honoring the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It is bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may be harmless, but the Libyan debate has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties clashed, as well as with the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to allow the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure aimed at cutting funding for US operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission has therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory – Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
Congressional indecision has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now take action.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution “congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide lawmakers as it did last June?
Senator and Chair of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
In the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on a constitutional amendment to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost every Republican in Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but that is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments to be tabled in Congress, on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that "would control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but they give their supporters – particularly the new Republicans who want to gild their CVs – the chance to boast of being the “author” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August called for a House and Senate vote to amend a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment banning the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of states are opposed to it.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as quick as they have been in the past.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slowed from the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
'Massacred but not beaten' Gabrielle Giffords says in first TV interview since shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on a television show on Monday night, sang Broadway’s “The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow” and said she wanted to get better rather than go back to Congress.
When she appeared on ABC's "20/20," alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show approached his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, passing through the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult."
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, responded "pretty well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of "20/20", aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special show traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, with his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair as doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask her to change her breakfast menu.
The videos released by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' recovery: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?.
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with doctors, said she does not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information for the first time about the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated while awaiting trial.
"There have been many deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
At her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
“So I’d say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t beaten,’” Kelly said.
You were just slaughtered.
And you're going to get better, get better, and come back stronger than ever.
More compassion than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans of New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in a tie suit stood at his feet to applaud him.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer present at the gala, in which Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, also participated, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were presented as some sort of orphan,” the military senior wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have developed between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say a few soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits.”
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to appear unthankful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect as they faced insurgents and traveled to faraway lands.
Others would wonder if “an angry and violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who had him interviewed subtly asked if he would be able to cope with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after he returned from the fight.
“When you approach the subject of service, you are confronted with negative impressions,” Colonel Cancian recalls as he talks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely praised by a country as unfamiliar with the military and seeing little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people largely focus on the depth of a military’s suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost, or the extent of injuries.
The military faces increasing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the military for alleged inaction on rape.
If so, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"It was a wake-up call," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texan has set aside its concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman’s room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will look forward to the decision of justice in a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and which will decide whether a trial against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of failing to stop the widespread rape in the military, thus violating the soldiers' constitutional rights.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number amounted to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke claims to be attacking the gallant military, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders."
The lawyer also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future prosecutions.
Her strategy: instead of assembling all the plaintiffs in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will initiate multiple trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
“The alleged wrongdoing is inherent in the complainants’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, women’s soldiers’ teams are playing an increasingly important role, particularly in getting in touch with local women.
Out of these two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives – two-thirds in combat.
It is time for the army to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three more trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center prepares a case against the four major military academies for allegedly fostering a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the nonprofit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for people claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were introduced to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5 percent of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the military were prosecuted - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Susan Burke's case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informs the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell police officers, doctors and commanders about her rape 11 times in detail.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her assailant - due to a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge at a trial in which she was asked about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of her assault.
Six people testified as moral witnesses for the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was rendered,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commander, 'It wasn't his trial, it was mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Whether the Lyman case and the other plaintiffs will move forward or not is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.
However, he points out, “In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.”
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction lies between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents as responsibility.
“The odds are heavily against them... but it’s important that they try,” he adds.
These things change only when the good guys have the will to fight.
If the lawsuit does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs’ attorney, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further lawsuits.
“We will continue to fight the military on this issue until there is reform,” she said.
Where until we die, one or the other of the two options.
Walls Have Eyes: Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy outlining his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being caught in deadly insanity in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, faced his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with a few of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific accuracy – the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett’s team discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their own future.
By coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens.”
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new must-have tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues such as social trends, through “Likes”, wall-posting and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content a day, the “data supernova” generates an explosion in search, increasing the number of search jobs whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you might not approach on the street.
“Before, when you tried to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in,” says Jamie Bartlett.
“Facebook avoids all this – you have direct access to their information.”
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and her colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their intoxicated exploits were vastly more likely to be alcoholics than discrete students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that students’ colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would too often speak of alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle.
“We know how to identify children at risk, who would otherwise not be recognized.”
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied statistics regarding the love situation and Valentine's Day, the 2010 midterm election turnout rate, and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information differently than by going through the Internet, it’s something else online.
“I don’t think a large number of users have ever thought about whether a researcher can study their profile,” said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London’s Knowledge Lab, according to a 2006 study he conducted by looking at his students’ Facebook walls.
“As far as they knew, exchanges were only seen by their friends.”
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and pen remain the best tools one can use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
“Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect – and social is not in front of a computer.”
"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars,” he told a courtroom filled with 500 people.
“As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it because you hold your mandate as organizations that support an ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for an additional 12 weeks, barred him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
“I found him cold and inhumane,” a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian TV channel NRK.
“I wasn’t comfortable, but I personally stepped forward a bit after seeing and hearing the suspect.”
Wearing a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the courtroom.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast “resistance” movement, the judge determined that he was not insane. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the entire nation.
“I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but that’s not the case,” a relative of one victim said.
“It would have been much easier.”
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs' Lost Interview at the Movies This Week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will air this week as the first part of a film in major markets, is how much this creative mind had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer; he identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a flowchart enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease, leaving them to think that a brilliant idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates d'idea from d'manuel.
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traces the birth of the computer, and he sat down for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
By that time, Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple for about 10 years, already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aiming for a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the major copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly raised, is the basis of the 68-minute film called Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in cinemas next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems here surprisingly excited to expose technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs weighs his thoughts clearly, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs’s perfectionism resurfaces, when he seems eager to hear Cringely’s questions, giving him elbowsticks to speed him up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, Steve Jobs evaluates what he sees as good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision for the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read Steve Jobs’ posthumous career reviews, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences from Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
“During all these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs goes on to detail his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" assessed at the nose and then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed accurate calculation of business costs.
On the Opportunity to Play a Tour to the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack into phone networks and make long-distance free calls.
The device has been the subject of many previous writings, but Steve Jobs’ euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We wrapped the ball in different things a half-dozen times and you were screaming in the public phone and it would happen to you a minute later on the public phone next door,” Jobs laughed.
“We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn't both know much, but we were able to invent a little thing that could control great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without that.
Steve Jobs goes on to recount a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have worked out: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices leave insanely laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett’s approach):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looks for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's Palo Alto research labs, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube, and I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On Improvisation of Innovation:
Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a glance.
Early in his career, as he settled down to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 credit days, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember some big arguments... I was yelling at by pretending it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse we could make for $15 that was incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are running low:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Suppose you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, what after?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are these types of people] who end up leading businesses and product-focused staff are pushed away from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can’t imagine designing a good product versus a bad product – the manual labor required.
This is what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been 10 times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They wrestled defeat from victory.
On Innovation as an Artistic Form:
“A huge piece of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are some compromises to be made... Some things you can’t do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories, too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made out of personal taste, trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring those things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health law opponents as court meets
The day the Supreme Court meets in camera to examine the issue of political discord, namely whether opposition to President Obama’s health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were spotted at a law firm-sponsored dinner that will defend the case in the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference to discuss petitions for review.
One of the cases involved a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 a.m. is expected next March, and the result will likely be likely to favor the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue about rejecting the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general of the United States during the George W. Bush administration.
Clément’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, a top Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health law.
Star guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: both judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue with the Canon 4C code, which states: “A judge may attend fundraisers from law-related organizations and others although the judge may not be an intervenor, guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event.”
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“Judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court.”
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dispels any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics saying they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’ wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was solicitor general of the Obama administration when the first objections to the law were brought to the level of the court of first instance.
Her critics pushed for Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in the defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record $18 billion order for airliners
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle airliners, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated $1 billion market.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order for 50 of its products.
This is a big deal, however, when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $ 18 billion.
Equally incredible is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need in the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft with a total value of $450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 two-aisle.
It was the airline Emirates based in Dubai that placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said on Monday that the airline Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six aircraft amounts to more than one billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
“These customers in particular have immense value.”
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So they have not only the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually harmful to airlines as it represents their biggest costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would make money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point as these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil rises, Dihora said.
“They have natural risk coverage,” he said.
Emirates’ order strengthens Boeing’s dominance in the large-vehicle market and helps curb the attempt to encroach on competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the aeronautical show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the larger version of the A350, which rivals the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing back its beginnings to increase its momentum as customers demand to increase its cargo capacity and autonomy.
Boeing’s shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister clearly beaten in Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the run for governor.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister appears to have lost her attempt to gain access to Michoacán governorship in violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
Early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of this western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon told radio on Monday after the election.
“They threatened our candidates, our election agents... They seized the ballot boxes, installed roadblocks... and forced people to vote” for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until losing the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out only from a few Calderon, who were at the top of the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother’s Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a leftist candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the initial results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection with drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence persisted.
A week before the election, a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, however corrupt the Michoacán elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging with a view to next year."
BASD urges Asia to help the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the eurozone emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would impede the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the director general of the Manila-based BASD, said the world’s two fastest-growing economic powers needed to “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe’s difficulties with an “indifferent eye” and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe’s leaders and resources would help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all together in this crisis.”
“Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not safe.”
“So if China and India can help, there’s nothing to stop them.”
In recent months, the eurozone has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has skyrocketed dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The booming sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the global economy will go into recession, and has prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Nag predicted that the IMF would channel any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance – such as buying the bonds of the U.S. financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater negotiating power to Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's trade and industry minister, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro zone as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a slowdown in foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and uneasy,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges to meet and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get the 1.2 billion Indians, at least 800,000 of whom live on $2 a day or less, to accept aid to Europe.
“One day, they will discover that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and going on vacation in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it,” he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the eurozone crisis was likely to cause “significant repercussions” across Asia.
BASD’s forecast for economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now faces “loss risks” due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop “relief plans” to protect themselves from economic downturn and significant capital leaks.
Pentagon warns of potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that impending automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields, to civilian rallies.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more in cuts is imminent if Congress fails to agree on spending.
“The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said Congress’ failure to reach a budget deal resulting in what is called sequestration would result in 23% cuts as well as the freezing of many new projects.
“Such a significant reduction, applied indiscriminately, would render most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a ship – and seriously undermine other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote.
“We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we almost certainly should send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our readiness.”
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
“Although wartime funding of foreign contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in core budgets,” Panetta said.
“Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and oversight of contracts that support the war.”
“Salary management staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.”
“We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon during the publication of Panetta’s letter.
“It’s not a consequence we can live with, and it’s certainly not the one we should be imposing on ourselves.”
“Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent senators’ warnings increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself has come to the top of the Pentagon, accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing tough choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen - a military with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free brigade."
"It's a fighter jet, with not enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don’t have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission,” Panetta said.
“It’s a depressed force, poorly prepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries.”
"Indeed, it invites aggression."
In an addendum to her letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could “generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk assumed in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could move to the cutting edge, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship, and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Putting an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its proponents say it is a critical step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines shows how pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies have destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has gone dumb by quickly issuing contradictory denials with irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to covering an extramarital liaison.
And then, none of those who have lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton sparked by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been instances where teachers have given test responses to students in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie to each other three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to shout: "I had you," deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades from prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research on such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lies have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don’t stutter, blush or stir at all times.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified lie detector can uncover the truth by examining the statement structure, facial micro-expressions, question formation, and response time.
I’ve spent several years examining scientific findings in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge about deception, and it’s clear that deception detection is a modern skill that’s easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating, or managing.
Good liars are skilled at reading others well, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more lies "centered" while women tell more lies "centered" - usually to protect someone's feelings - than married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as an unbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called "setting the benchmark data".
This helps provide a reference point for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe your subject’s posture, laughter, vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally stirs their feet permanently so as not to throw unfair accusations when you see them stir their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for indications of verbal and nonverbal deceptive behaviors.
Think of these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean towards an exit, change posture significantly, or present a “post-interview” relief – an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult issues have passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to seek to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to your subject’s vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson skidded using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use distant language: "I haven't had sex with this woman...Miss Lewinsky" or completely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wooden tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing the skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial Pipeline Plan Will Be Disrupted After Threat of Late U.S. Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - angering unions while soothing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still earn its approval.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department’s announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of Nebraska’s dunes and the Ogallala Aquifer, vast groundwater sources.
“It’s a real way forward,” Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The State Department’s re-environmental review would likely have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year’s election, although officials deny the policy’s involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed his support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do so, he would have to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have staked on the estimated 20,000 oil pipeline-related jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pushing for legislation to force the removal of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would pose only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department's inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle, launched into a violent outburst in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited out of fear.
The singer’s “Lady Marmalade” tirade frightened 18-month-old Geneviève Monk, so much so that she suffered “personality changes, sleep disorders” and “increased fear of strangers,” her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his nursery teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk walked down into the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and laid down her daughter for a while.
“Someone came up behind me and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and went to get her,” she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
“She said to me in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter by the door,’” Roseanna Monk said.
“I said, ‘What you say or think, I’m not interested.’
She became enraged and began to use vows - the word "" and the word "" with a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother – who still held Geneviève in her arms – and had to be held back by her entourage who dragged her into a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started vomiting, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
Lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return our calls for comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family is considering donating all the money it received to a child cancer charity.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informality increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment fell and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-named of change, which has generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main economic indicators.
February’s low temperatures, aside from causing losses of trillions for the agricultural sector, limited the state’s economic opportunities for growth, caused a 3.6 percent contraction in overall economic activity in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic 31.16 percent decline in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of jelly assignments issued by the Mexican Council of Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the rest 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chick peas.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, which increased the unemployment rate of the state during the first three quarters of the year, because from January to March 55 thousand 053 signooens were unemployed, with a rate of 18 per cent in the second half of the year.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly depending on the actions carried out by public policy.
“What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in an illicit way it is not easy for them to work to earn them, to invest them and to use them in something,” he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
“The number of people leaving the state to work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of entry difficulties and second because on entering they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which makes unemployment rise,” he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labor market in Signoen is aggravated considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in this state work there without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Aside from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the state's lag is low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to records from the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly earnings of the workers from Signoen was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the State FDI reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, representing a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government of the State has a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government requested in July at the public congress the approval of a loan of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was of 2,600 trillion pesos and until November the government did not see any profit in the sector.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employers' sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés' Government demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year was really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we had to align the effort of all and especially the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events like the frosts at the beginning of the year have held back the state’s economy and restricted its yield and growth.
“The low economic flow is produced by several events, among which frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of e flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close well below the expectations we had,” he says.
Redefining the Vocation
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, we want to channel the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important to detonate the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he says.
Much to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he says.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marihuana
A person living in Novolato has been sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days fined for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General’s Office has informed that the convicted small trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for an offence against health, in his variant of possession of marihuana for sale.
In accordance with file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on June 7, 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was driving in a white pick-up truck carrying a black bag in the vehicle’s luggage compartment and in the copilot’s seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Crime Enforcement Centre.
Debts to contributions to works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrans may not be finished where to register serious delays due to lack of economic resources, reported Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that, while construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk because the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to offer contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25% and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is going to end soon they have not given us anything, even if since July they have had to give us some," he says, "and we, to not register delays, have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State Administration had not provided at that time.
“We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, had to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid,” he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the managements so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end, they have not given us anything."
Court Validates ‘Analog Cutting’ in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called “analog cut” from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree that details the actions to be taken to achieve the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, due to the fact that radio and television regulations are an assignment reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions provided by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of ministers also resolved to dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister-President said that he disagreed with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also do not consider that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, whose constitutional mandate is the direction of the state.
Substitution of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this translates into better radio spectrum exploitation, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing change, he argued, would be postponing the benefits of digitalization that involves a public-interest decision that does not only have a technical dimension, “because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the State Executive".
He recalled that many countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, has in any way invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative, he assured.
The possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoacán is analyzed
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the "vote-by-vote" count is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal reform in electoral matters.
It will be remembered that Michoacán did not approve either his Political Constitution or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral process to come into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel had omitted its publication of the Off-State Law with the deadlines laid down by the Off-State Law.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and described as "invalid and illegal" the state's proxy vote for constitutional reforms, because it has no right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there are no minutes of votes and counts in the record of the ballot box is not found in the president of the ballot box; or there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all ballot boxes of the election may be achieved when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate who is supposed to have won the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the party and/or the co-sponsor.
The total count of the vote can also be achieved if at the end of the common count it turns out that the difference between the supposed winning candidate and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party from which the candidate came second, in which case the electoral packages that have been the subject of the partial count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday towards the night, and Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a mass of requiem.
According to his family, the last wish of the lieutenant-colonel was for his ashes to be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving tributes to others who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest ones attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the vigil chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes to the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues in the technology bachelor's degree and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part when he was preparing for the bachelor's degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the driver's sister.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she considered that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared a lot for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it, because they said he even had truck pain; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his relative, for this he knows that his uncle dies doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His Last Farewell
With honors was said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute that was headed by Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force as he studied sports in 1985, directors and students of the Sallo Technological Institute.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all officials of this service.
The remains of the Saltillo-born Bacio Cortés pilot arrived (incinerated) at 6:05 p.m. to be handed over by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group’s esplanade, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and his other parents.
Three abandoned corpses located in Cadereyta NL property
A few hours before they were found, the military had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the stroke of grace, in an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km drive from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has beige and coffee color the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
A metre away was another individual’s body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on the stomach.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, because no sockets were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends directed by an organized crime group towards the other, apart from a few bullet holes in the latter and in the portal.
11 Captured at Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defense presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to be related to seizures, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to published information, in a first made on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and managed to save one who had been deprived of liberty.
They were confiscated from three buildings and one cell phone; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas."
In another event that took place on November 12 at 06:00, military personnel made a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By stopping them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested at La Frauda, when he tried to escape while seeing the soldiers.
Clandestine burials are attributed to them in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire Eurozone.
A presidential palace statement said Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he can form the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats in its majority, even if it is not clear when the new executive will take over.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he said.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well laid out," he added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy is battling a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a harsh austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability has placed the yield on Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland have had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We have said that we will greatly support this government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency.
Monti’s chances for success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced him to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers’ groups and youth and women’s organizations.
He will end his meeting tour on Tuesday night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, who enabled an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections advance.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist it should only be trained by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convoked participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 summoned by the two countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While the national and European champions, the number one in the monthly FIFA rankings, account for a large register of A-class inter-selection games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain year-round intense activities in national league and cup championships and disputes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated playoffs of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish National Team is that of goalkeeper ?ker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, headliner of Barcelona, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke forward Raúl González with 102.
Loan of the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana, are left-back Junior Díaz, with 48 appearances and goal scorer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one, and ?lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still starting.
The historic scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in his turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to happen in this country.
That’s what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil, last week.
The band is in the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour and will make its only stopover in Central America on Sunday.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles band The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once on vacation; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we’ll be able to spend a few days there.
So it makes us excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensely the previous days.
What is your message to your most devoted followers?
Thank you for staying with us for all these years.
It took us 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does it add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve offered over the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing there.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next door to Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we learned it, through the people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never been there, we have no restrictions as to what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's the point of this?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, which is why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to perform each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t performed in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and may have forgotten about them.
It makes the show more interesting to us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting to people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us had imagined that we were going to be a big rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for over 20 years makes it sound like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together excites us a lot.
We love each other and love to create music.
We’re lucky to go to places in the world we’ve always wanted to go.
Things couldn't get better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of big groups.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
This is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it’s much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to still be friends with all of them and it’s an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours has been together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many bands normally last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we all care about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to everyone to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity hasn’t been easy; however, thanks to your success, you’ve been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don’t spend too much time on tour because it’s easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect the music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn’t really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn’t release a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think about the incredible person that Andy has been and how he made me laugh with music a lot, it was always a pleasure to talk about it.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and this was the band we liked the most, so we’re looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it has to be very distracting.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's lyrics live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bass player, what are its influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam keep up grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the bands that came up at the same time and, if that’s relevant now, I think that’s wonderful, because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first, his music had darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting, because I think there are songs on the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, that qualify as very obscure songs, although these may sound a bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there’s a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, mean that to me.
I also think that you can be happy and even that way you can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he has in the feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from a variety of conditions, including a four-times-operated tongue cancer that is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the release of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, arguably, he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has been operated on four times for tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 pounds, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving time in the National Directorate of Special Operations since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of various ministers and bosses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the high point of a long agenda of meetings with the political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans resident in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be “propitiate for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations,” according to information published by the South American presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to hasten the implementation of tax exchange agreements to break out of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) “gray list”, integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachio plumber moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores around the world, was designed from the beginning to make good use of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile system, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses,” Nintendo Spain’s specialty press officer Omar Álvarez said during the video game’s presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", as hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a fast and smooth game play.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the more experienced will be able to take a "second turn" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional incursion of Super Mario also assumes the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo winks at fans of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustache plumber has to navigate platforms mined dangers to free Princess Peach.
Even though I player finds novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves Portillo’s extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to judge him there.
In a press conference, Colom said that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he had "not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given rise to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did presupposes an executive approach after exhausting all the judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former representative for the period 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted of misappropriation of Q120 million to the Department of Defense when he was president, which was the trial before extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
Entity was born to avoid marginalization of uneducated youth
The record of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
To this is added the long hundred years of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in an event celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats that more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping poorly trained, unemployed, drug-addicted or marginalized people.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijov.
Alongside the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to the mayor and current eco-socialist municipal councilor Ricard Goma.
Also attending in the large hall of Fabra i Coats was the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the general director of charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
The president gave Trinijove as an example of how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro parties, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
There is evidence that the nightmare of residents at 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned the building they were illegally occupying at noon yesterday, where they organized micro-partyes that despaired the neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From this day on, there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of that of water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, its business fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property were doing her unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner had to respond to complaints from the neighbors about the noise, while according to the latter, the trouble was not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The head of the nightclub explained that the problems were so great that she even concluded an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common life and civility that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were robberies as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in the property".
Yesterday also, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police moved to 35 Montral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportuneness of the call beyond the controversy on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already-extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi Bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises by itself: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this former caste of elect speak of when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have come forward.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green blocks has not been carried out.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the verdict of the architect for which the title of "Collserola gates" contains a "lexical trap": one should not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban planning world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The dangers deriving from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and which had in the Forum area "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
“Limiting something already means setting the next step,” that is, overcoming it.
“We need to think about new planning tools, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can cause real disasters.”
By sticking more to the question, Modol believes that, by simplifying, the side of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Board of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the mayor offers to his corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he hears that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubtful" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success," he says) that one had to create: "We architects should only be an instrument."
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the bases of the contest there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "We have called 16 cross-sectional contests - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he opted to participate in the 16 contests.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can clash in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In his opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the strip immediately superior to Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, Casino Red’s legal guardian granted forgiveness to the mayor’s brother in Monterrey for the lawsuit brought against him for alleged blackmail.
After spending 72 years arrested, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red grants him pardon before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale bombing, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded the payment of an economic quota for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against Mayor PANiste's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of Public Prosecutor 3 for Patrimony Offences, he was transferred to Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He stayed there for the next 49 days when he was given a second order of detention after the Public Prosecution Officer dismissed the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadereyta penal center allegedly for blackmailing with a million and a half pesos the owners of the Red Casino; but he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention center as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine the guilt of Jonas, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing its operation.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself in front of Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could regain his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Prosecutor attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and which of the partners of the gambling house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to file 197/2011, legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal and subsequently no claim can be filed regarding the trial brought against him; no compensation for damages and no punishment will be required either.
At 3:50 p.m., after the court hearing, Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The clerk of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, traveled to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been legally pardoned and his file would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people died
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter crashed directly into the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the take-off of the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees within 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements for transporting personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations made in the impact zone do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In research it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was presented in a structural way.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For now, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services assured that at the time of the impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was operating at cruising speed and this happened on a soft ascending ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruising operation at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, TBS holder Pérez Jácome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual Theft:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was performed according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned suitable conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico, there were layers of low-rise cloudiness.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew sought an area of lower height and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact took place on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The model of dispersion of the remains of the aircraft makes it possible to assume that the helicopter collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
At the site of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple ground contacts.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above the average sea level, the ground had a slope that went from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disjointed along his journey.
The information provides evidence that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the encircled area around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact took place under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and youth; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and youth, called the 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol that will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
Investigators are invited to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where evidence is made to minors every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the target of 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation is to know the components and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires related to food.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of their diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that Saturdays will be applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (seeking to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
“The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there has been a 77 percent increase in obesity for boys and 47 percent for girls; in the case of overweight, there has also been a dramatic increase,” said the IMSS expert.
He said the rationale for finding markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American, 30 percent European and five percent African heredity and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity results in the inability to burn the excess energy that is consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the full evaluation of the children, which makes it possible to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even says that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is handled in a confidential manner, and doctors give it in writing to parents, who are told each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - cornmeal pâté wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt from UNAM would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a blend with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cassis each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who assured that if the construction and maintenance process of the bituminous pavement is adequate, the cassis could even be completely eliminated.
During his conference A Technological Opinion on Cassava, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for developing asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and therefore, cassis formation.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The QC researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it generating effort, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, according to the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, is put a last layer called rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide grip in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be cared for.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and as a result causes cassis.
In the process of formation of a cassis, he says, the first that spoils is rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid frequent formation of cassis.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair cassis easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What's missing from Valle's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna to fail to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle received her 14th title as a princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico ascended with the crown and the sceptre, the department already sums up 14 titles of Princess and Melina, which were close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Alveola Arenaro (1979), Patricia
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Pretty Face of Vogue, the titles obtained by the crowning Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took her away.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What was the book that marked you and why? asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it's a form of culturalization, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is 'The Little Prince', it's a pretty deep book.
Now I am reading Crime and Punishment, it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called The Burning of Blood.
This response did not please first because of the term "culturalizing" and secondly not to explain concretely how each book quoted had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what needs to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses put forward is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota hinted that being the favorite, the ovationate and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best handmade costume, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she did not shine on the scene".
And it was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Even though the two parades seemed self-confident, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on RCN’s “Come en casa” program, said that the fact that Melina was named a princess “confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the queen’s crown.”
In addition, Valle avoided the press in the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For this reason, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
“Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before starting the Contest they are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for his blemishes from his back and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good diet and responsible physical work.
Queens coach Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the candidate of Valle was the surgery she had undergone.
“The surgeries are good, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that.”
For this award, which the National Beauty Competition presents for the first time, after the swimsuit parade arose a cruel prediction that was fulfilled last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo was making to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So was the work of the person of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Cali typist went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4th, a typist of the Cali ITC went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists working in the ITC’s local offices, this week was the turn of “availability” of Eliazar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses he specialized in typography, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against the alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who ran the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to carry the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He didn’t have a beard, he was dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much leaner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a picker and a lantern, Eliazar compared the corpse’s fingerprints with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a typist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know about our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the corpses, typists support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of those captured.
When captured, many offenders present fake ID cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different robberies,” he recalls.
Fingerprints can also dispel or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative may be a suspect in the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it puts him on the scene.
A CTI typist explained that we extract "fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a picker or strip is used to pick them up.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of deductants, or to the National Civil Registry.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without papers,” said the ITC expert.
He explained that not everything is how it is shown in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything that one touches does not necessarily become a footprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is made.
'Indignant' defies authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were tumbling in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large proportion of the people have acceded to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied New York authorities on Tuesday by attempting to re-enter, through a court order, Manhattan’s place where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were tumbling in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allowed the 'indignados' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square again, we will settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the ‘outrageous’ response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the camp and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignants' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church Parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization says there were hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the movement and tried to intervene in favor of them before the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned compound - remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, during which we must analyze the legality of this morning's evacuation.
Some demonstrators who had been displaced so far were carrying and distributing copies of this court order at that time and were even handing it over to the officers who were monitoring the square, which caused “some small clashes,” Bray said, denouncing the fact that some officials hit the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or from enforcing “laws issued after the start of the occupation or from prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but warned that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters "violate the law".
Bloomberg said it had ordered the evacuation of the place because it was becoming “a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm other people,” because “certain stores had received threats” and residents were afraid “for their quality of life.”
“This morning’s evacuation at dawn was disgusting and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests of American workers than it is in defending the financial interests of American workers,” the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
"Occupy Wall Street" officials also said they do not plan to hold "major actions" on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will play the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show.
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian actress Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
Private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will release on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images from the TV show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread online broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary supporting in a crib a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth," appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special also features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American whore Kim Kardashian during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that has become the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since World War II.
Early estimates by the Government of Tokyo estimated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have subsided.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn the page definitively: GDP rose by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter – for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 – also assumes the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructure, use the deficiencies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up mainly due to changes in domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo turned to the domestic market when the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “shelter values” elected by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the unrest forecast by the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic buoyancy is determined by the health of major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, took responsibility for their weak results between July and September the contribution of the yen.
While the markets continue to be based in the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not let down its guard.
“We need to follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy, said yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that the majority of member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being restrained.
Because it dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone has even been below the average, which is in the 100 level, dropping eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens fuels doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but Conservatives won’t sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to entangle itself in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is rather imposed by the Brussels demands than by a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the one hundred-day period established in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the New Democracy Conservative party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures that he demanded in no case.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit on October 26," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not cast doubt on his position: “We have committed ourselves to assisting the Transitional Government, but we have committed ourselves to nothing more.”
The conservative leader has gone one step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the bodies that need to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the vain impact of Papandreou’s referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will only unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign “an unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible.”
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading place at the global level in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one whose goal is the reduction to half the volume of people who live with incomes.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and takes on this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originated during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women".
We have “reached many goals” and “we face many challenges.”
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are coming out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The momentum in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an “admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty”, the work of which she has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project yesterday brought him the title of "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid on the part of the "bank of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said micro-credits presuppose “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty”, and now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "whom all close the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned on the agenda but was imposed in the fall, especially to satisfy activists who consider the government’s policy too lax vis-à-vis the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, after their speeches, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The Chancellor's idea - and the motion - is based on a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro”.
For the chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the president of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is in any case one of the motion's proposals adopted by the congress, which was clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the weight of each country on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted to increasing the weight of Germany.
Concerned with calming the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but she has also not sought to win her congress on the backs of “small” European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticize arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of “French-German friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is sick leave fraud?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launched the sick leave offensive.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and give a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and welfare.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to save money in a context of rigor, but is no less foreshadowing an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
First of all with a view to budgetary savings: the government is considering imposing a fourth day of care on private employees before taking over a work stoppage.
In short, without a specific business agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of pay, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks to arouse anger, but that would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic in scope: imposing on officials a day of non-compensated care in case of cessation of work (they have so far not had a delay of care, compared to three days in private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also relaunching the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
“The controls will be much more important and, moreover, if you are caught, you will pay back,” Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday.
As with other cases, the ad effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of stop-of-work fraud.
It has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often paid off.
The French are no sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were granted in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted in 2008 for 5% of health expenditure, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this sum, 46% concerned maternity leave and work-related accidents, and 54% concerned sick leave, or €6.2 billion.
2.5% of health care costs.
In 2010, French people had an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any sick days.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France ranged between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud represents very little compared to black work.
As for fraud, it is only small in scope.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 means that checks are systematic on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 made for short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of cases "inadaptated or unjustified" out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, therefore, 169,000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who have had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little compared, for example, to that of black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme in order to rebound its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said in front of Parliament on Monday, adding that the hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
“To continue the efforts to rebound the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” said the head of government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on 27 October will be the “main task” of the new government, as the country’s participation in the euro zone “is at stake,” he added.
As a result, Papadémos predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “to around 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, on Monday supported the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
"We will not vote for further measures," he said at a meeting with his party's New Democracy deputies.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and fighting against waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Olli Rehn, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary €8 billion loan without written assurance from all parties that they would support the planned measures, replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to Royal Society of Canada report
When it comes to palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of a major report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
Early on, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
If Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has engendered a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death.”
Whether medical or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, this rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions that run counter to the federal government's position, which has already said it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization leads to abuses in enforcement, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on incompetent or non-consensive persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, said yesterday, there would be more cases of such overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," Downie said.
Canadians support euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, respondents estimate 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing patient care, the situation is less clear, say the report's authors.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
When it comes to palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some health law experts have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada’s expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme", inter alia because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
“It opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 years old could ask for help to commit suicide,” says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the person's autonomy above all other values that contribute to the social fabric of society.
“In society,” he says, “there are beacons and constraints.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called a “pro-euthanasia manifesto.”
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, specifically challenges the report’s data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Leave Power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the premises of the Foreign Ministry.
Diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with Russia’s support, resists them and denounces a “conspiracy” against the country.
Two days after the Arab League suspended Syria, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, took a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s forces were still killed.
“If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the King of Jordan, a neighboring country of Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Turkish mediation efforts with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had failed.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a “strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking on an increasingly harsh tone” in the face of repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have died in southern Syria’s Deraa region, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed "in exchanges of fire and shelling with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a news conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was “going towards the end of the crisis.”
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not bow,” he added, assuring that “the bold plots against Syria will fail.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which he said was entrenched in “paranoia.”
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis relief plan decided on November 2, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities under protest and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday deemed the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis relief plan, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for some time for the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain “sacrifices”, in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament.
“Monti spoke of an important program with a lot of sacrifices,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the talks, after meeting with the designated Council President.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he expects Mario Monti to seek a vote of confidence in parliament by Friday to ensure the new government has enough support.
The consultations will end with Mr. Monti presenting a short list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In “democracy, there are clear deadlines” to prepare a government and its program, he said, saying he was “sure that the markets will be patient and understand.”
Its designation by the president had initially been hailed by the markets, but concerns have picked up particularly after an unexpected drop in industrial output in the eurozone in September.
The prime minister-designate should be a team of mostly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to House Speaker Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti committed himself, once he took office, to working urgently and with the aim of making Italy "re-protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn said: “Even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change.
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of budget balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for more stringent measures.
Italian boss Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that does not have growth can not respect the deficit parameters".
Mr. Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "teacher" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place 200 billion euros worth of government bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist has helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA said last week it was "seriously concerned" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, reportedly worked for three decades starting in the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA referred to "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a member state informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear program of his home country."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence declined slightly or progressed little, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offenses increase again,” the human rights organization Human Rights First said, “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be considered a serious human rights violation,” said Paul Legendre, head of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he added, adding that this could lead to improved police reporting on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual belonging.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
Micro-blogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" make it possible to follow more clearly, live the activity of the other "Twittos", the users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they send messages, subscribe to new accounts, have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “on a small percentage of users in August” before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast a message from someone else, ?followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of insiders, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were arguing over the value of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” writes ?jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed,” sniffed Dannykronstrom.
Austria
Inclusion of a "golden rule" in the constitution
Austria’s ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democratic grand coalition government decided on Tuesday to enshrine a budgetary “golden rule” in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by Austria’s sovereign rating agencies (triple A).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a council of ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were to be lowered by only one notch, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian-Democratic foreign minister.
Austria is responding to a request from the Eurozone summit in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", with Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to move public debt to 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen fort
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was rising not far from the historical levels that prompted Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record of vigor since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has steadily risen since then, boosted by purchases by investors who consider it a “safe haven value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar went back under 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency is detrimental to the archipelago's exports because it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign revenues by Japanese firms when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan struggles to rebuild" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region, Noda said, fearing that this price increase of the yen would kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third-largest economy returned to growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households hit by the disaster.
But the prime minister said the price of the yen did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “appropriate measures,” hinting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of treasury bonds by 5 trillion yen (47 billion euros), increasing the limit on the amounts it devotes to purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros).
Eurozone:
rates are rising, stocks are rising
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weak countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the eurozone, the European stock markets are sinking a little more into negative territory, this Tuesday 15 November.
At 10 a.m. in Paris, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With new strains on borrowing yields from eurozone states in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to make up some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed fears from market participants about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of variation as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area is penalizing the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it backed down after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has called on the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with suffocation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the “main task” of his government.
Spain is in the crosshairs of markets as parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between Germany’s and Spain’s 10-year bonds has reached a new historical high.
Pending growth figures for the euro area
On the statistical side, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised its second quarter figure downwards, with gross domestic product (GDP) falling 0.1% instead of stagnating.
And it is really the fourth one that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., as the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If there is a subject that can not be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influences the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy for an election to be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that nuclear power holds there.
The debate will be fruitful only if it explores the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will result in a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless it deprives a huge portion of the world’s population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to overcome the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate disruption, a subject that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident did not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case with Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a substitute source, nor with Switzerland, which just wants to build only the latest generation plants.
Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by restarting the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the discourse.
Berlin's choice will result in higher electricity prices, an energy dependence compounded by the increased use of imported gas, particularly from Russia, a rise in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
In a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is worth pondering.
European champion of wind power, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; by virtue of which, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Therefore, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not express opposition in principle to this energy, the polls show.
Let us remember that our country’s energy policy has helped to build an industrial chain of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Highly exporting, it drives a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them highly job-creating and non-relocable.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros a year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years when the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, nor is there any diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power plants as well as the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the French and German safety authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it able to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the clear path to seize leadership in the unavoidable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made the news, with the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming in passing that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
It is because there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between left and right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising almost 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fears of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers were shared on both left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be accorded to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve our “migration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps electorally payable; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migrant flows on economic growth.
Restricting immigration anaemia growth and harms employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are likely to replace national workers, especially low-skilled workers, who are putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national wage earners, with the bulk of their jobs in job-deprived sectors.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the job offer.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will struggle to work in a country that is experiencing a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on nationals' salaries and employment.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in long-term real wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenues minus expenditure) of €150,000 to public budgets over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the term, to go and get the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, when used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be thought
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be sufficient for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct manner possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an ease of thinking.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an “instrument of oppression”, as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also, first and foremost, a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true Greek referendum in this respect will have been double revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought of in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a dispersed order.
A white-seing to the absolute European monarch or a leap together in the void of nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want couprets, but a common exercise of right, serene and continuous choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we can no longer stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bends to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, that suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
Together, Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except, of course, to lead us to disaster.
After having long fought against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone now calls for the European economic government.
Or so.
But thinking without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We need to take on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution in interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic Europe, a real European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let’s make Europeans.
"Contactless" smart cards become widespread
The world smart card fair opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most powerful segment is the contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or pay for your purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been deployed.
But the big supermarkets put the double bites.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards.
To move up the pace, banks must now equip their customers.
“Two large French institutions have committed to systematically disseminating contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, general manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to make transactions.
“They were late.”
“But they should finally see a real boom next year.”
“We plan to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale, too, said yesterday that it is preparing to market an offer that allows its customers to pay contactlessly with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is spreading
Paris is concerned about ties between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected for a long time, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers has now “acquired the certainty”.
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French men in Niger last January reportedly uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their captors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
The Terrorist Axis
The analysis of past calls points to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we must wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We’ve known for years that the sect has outside financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these “supports” have been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourse of Boko Haram or in his modes of operation, which now involve the use of increasingly complex and identical suicide bombers or explosive devices as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of unworthy enlightened people.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram – which means “Western education is a sin” in Hausa – advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicises itself and demands strict respect for Sharia law while its activists engage in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, nuanceless.
The army is invading the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on the sect would radicalize and leave its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the police’s secure HQ in a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the UN headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, which al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, in an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete with simplism and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been multiplying thunderous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans – often unsupported – are fuzzy.
Mitt Romney, who is best placed in the race for the nomination of the "Great Old Party", has threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them "for manipulation of their currency", a theme that bears on in an America exasperated by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if it involves the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that “flatters” emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran,” he boasted.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranking candidate, shows an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering China’s military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop a nuclear capability” – apparently ignorant of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, said he was ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine when it came to anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of its naïve dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq, on its misrepresentations in Libya, thus sticking to it a weak label.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers Obama’s national security record, which eliminated bin Laden, to be rather positive.
From Iraq, she is wary of the military interventions that lead to the lull.
And, arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to revive its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The Nord Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, directly connecting Western Europe and Russia to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated on Tuesday in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands Mark Rutte have turned together the steering wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the West European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive in Western Europe each year via a first 1,224 km tube connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is to be completed by the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third one on the same path.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge yard looks like victory.
The project was strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to shut it off from Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But this is at the cost of a weakening of energy Europe, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has managed, in just five years, to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas consuming, and whose deposits are in decline.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically,” François Fillon confirmed when inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how big gas contracts are as political as they are economic.
All of this explains the wide smiles displayed by the Gazprom executives, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of steel sheathed in concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at 200 m on average.
To build it, minefields dating from World War II had to be avoided.
“A hundred had to be kidnapped or destroyed, as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
There was also a need for more measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts over its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but project managers gave it up when the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state-owned company permanently set up off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have foreseen the welds to have a leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced into the tube, one meter wide in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, it delivers accurate information about possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to run for 50 years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars on departure, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Joined were the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture, Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to the company, for 20 renewable years, all gas transmission capacities.
“Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” Müller said.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to pay their fees, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specifics of the gas that arrives, before it is transferred into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, of hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, elastic, leaves of a broken white color, as if aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design notebook but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which designates a varnished cotton used to cover benches for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought back an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces sold.
We are far from the confidential production of the early years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, because the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, has almost 100 employees today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city center and has managed to impose her identity.
“We have followed the air of time and this new need to write, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies Moleskine’s development: recently, the brand launched an exhibition “Detour” where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a range of supports.
A success that envied: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th Week for Disabled Employment opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy implemented in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still twice the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the whole population.
Discouraging?
“No,” said Éric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, the association that organizes the Disabled Employment Week.
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable."
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher.”
"But there is still a lot to do."
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before they get to work.
They are rather elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that complicate the return to employment, and that "are the node of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, general manager of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit workers with disabilities.
Here are the objective brakes.
It remains the unspoken, evolving mentalities, certainly, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur association for the City indicated that the managers interviewed have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of workers with disabilities, set in a law of 1987.
The latest known figures, dating from 2008, report a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of "taxed" institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, rising from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses,” says Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before taking on the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match gives them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the podium of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace.
Five months after the mood gesture of his striker against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise to do about him.
“I’m very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he’s Belgian.”
“I want to move forward,” said the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances in the club and in the selection, "it is a whole, he justified himself."
"In Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
“I have to take my marks.”
Moved against Romania on Friday night in preparation for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Without omitting the notion of “pleasure”.
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the successful campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supportive,” he says.
Of course, this contributes to further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
Especially since in front, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We met just now."
“To be able to play against them is only happiness.”
With goodwill, Leekens, for his part, spoke of “pride.”
"Pride" to play "a gala match."
"Pride" also to note - as a "neighbor" - that France has "become a very high level team" just over a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a job of thunder," he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be happy to share the plane with the Blues heading... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting bigger,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll be aware of it in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento’s Portugal are starting their return with great optimism against Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the meantime, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt, the Selecçao, which he has been at the controls since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to unwind.
With the game going (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
“It’s a good result, but there’s a certain risk because we didn’t score goals on the outside.”
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even if the part is obviously "very tight", says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
“We are expecting a very tight match, but we are quite convinced that we can take the lead,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroz's successor said.
The draw reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
No one can suffice for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but there's a certain risk because we didn't score goals on the outside," Bento said.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put as much pressure on the Bosnians as possible so as not to "give them time to think."
That’s a good idea, if you’re realistic this time.
