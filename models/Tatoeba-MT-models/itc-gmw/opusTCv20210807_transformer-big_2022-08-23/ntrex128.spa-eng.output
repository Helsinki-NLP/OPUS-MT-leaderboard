Members of the Assembly (AM) in Wales are concerned about 'looking like muppets'
Some Members of the Assembly are bewildered by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This confusion stems from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Assembly member stated that his group was concerned "that he stayed with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A member of the Assembly of the Party of Wales commented that his entire group was "unpleasant" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation jump from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the naming of the Members of the Assembly will be the matter of the Members themselves."
The 2017 Wales Government Act gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals that revealed broad support for calling the Parliament of Wales to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option garnered most support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring Assembly President Elin Jones to the head, who should send the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the operation of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of Assembly Members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say in the question of what they should be called when they deliberate on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country’s name will be changed to “North Macedonian Republic.”
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its bid to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin remain silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the older people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“Today, there is neither one thing nor the other.”
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods that neighbors go to regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of goods will not last as long as leaders hope and that “sooner or later, they will return to the starting point.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who won’t help the sanctuaries left in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and will therefore speed up the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshipping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of St. Martin, under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who were reluctant to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged, and while Father Johnson’s parishioners were making plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the lane.
The Rev. David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called it “the campaigns of the poor.”
In July, the expert who played the chimney called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the world’s first lantern used by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who went to play the larger Riverside Church lantern, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese would "try to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Scuba Diving for Lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving for lobsters in California the day the lobster season opened, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that "he was screaming that he had been bitten.
,
He had his collarbone shattered,” Hammel observed as he came to the boy.
“I screamed at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark,” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The first responder, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablad, to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans boost UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialized employees in the hallways of their beauty and style establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at 2.800 trillion pounds and growing compared to falling sales in fashion and household goods, the largest beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successfully surpassed, the same will be done in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the shelf space that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test its concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first newly opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift to daily purchases of small amounts of food from local stores force supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said the stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets into hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is believed to have boosted grocery sales and made these acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion about how to split the revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in its supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury’s 281 pharmaceutical facilities to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's commented, "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles in ways that enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offering is designed to suit every need, and an attractive environment and comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is “furious” after Holly Willoughby breaks an 11-million-pound deal
Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, went "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke an 11-million-pound deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time to devote to the fashion and accessories brand Truly.
This business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones by leaving his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the golden TV girl admitted that her new deals, valued at as much as 1.5 million pounds, left no time to devote to Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The deal had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was shaping up as a favorite to double Willoughby’s fortune of about 11 million pounds.
As Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented, “Truly was by far Holly’s top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her going for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved totally amazed.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow headquarters, ready-to-sell products."
Experts believe the departure of presenter This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that last night “there was no business talk.”
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump commented with his mocking voice as a “news anchor.”
"I have not renounced anything."
He said Kim is interested in meeting him again after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate response” from the US to the first steps towards North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he said, the US continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s outlook was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
“We got along great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: an end to missile tests, help to free hostages and bring the deadly remains of U.S. soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had had to move, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, which complicates things a bit," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send Palu, they are still not sure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency agency, said authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure improvements central to his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko’s administration, which is facing re-election next year.
In addition, it must face the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch this: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge equals the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a 89th minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 meters from Chelsea's goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it at the second pole.
The action sent him over the area and headed towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell into the net.
“I was trying to put myself in that position to take the ball and players like Shaq always play very far ahead, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think too much, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midfielder made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that move, before turning around by racing near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the midfield.
Afterwards, he made a nice pass into space that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and ended up throwing the ball into the net of the second post with a left foot kick that Liverpool's Alisson Becker couldn't stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at Estadio San Paolo, in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia Tsunami casualties rise to 832
The number of casualties from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country’s emergency agency said early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and unleashed waves as high as six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man as murder suspect after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, which resulted in the arrest of a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O’Hagan commented: “The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
Also, I would recommend to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to catch something on dashcam to contact us as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his apartment, but police tell him no one can enter or leave the building.
He was perplexed when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now informed that they will be allowed to re-enter in a few hours.
Someone heard an officer tell a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the spot in tears.
He keeps saying, “It’s terrible.”
At two o’clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon controlling the block of floors.
Anyone who has information that sends an email to DM ?MerPolCC, calls 101 or contacts Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, registration 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament becomes the latest commemorative success for “rewriting history”
Its ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestions as “crazy” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that getting Oliver Cromwell’s figure out of Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
He may sacrifice the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent representation of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebrating.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, it is clear, monarchy.
Whether it is a fully accurate description is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebrating and commemorating.”
Murdering Pig Attacks Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a southwest China market, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered in blood near a well on the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs from a well in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to a nearby well was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-kilogram pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and shattered,” the cousin, whose surname is “Wu,” told The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to stop it from attacking anyone else, while police were collecting evidence on the spot.
It appears that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, this is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 295 kilograms cornered a farmer on its tractor until his wife scared the animal.
After some pigs ate an Oregon rancher in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs aren’t usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What we have to do is have the right respect for them,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rainfall in the southwestern U.S.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it travels over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind gusts of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, from Sunday at five o’clock in the morning (Eastern time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressures are starting to build up in the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will start driving intense tropical rains northward toward the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain hits the approaching low pressure, there will be heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible desert detachments.
Heavy tropical rainfall will cause rainfall of nearly 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding may occur with rapidly worsening conditions.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not at all recommended to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn cannons into raging rivers and storms will cause cracked winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rainfall on specific parts of the southern California coast.
Torrential rains may leave up to two centimeters of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slippery.
This would be the region’s first torrential rainfall during the wet season.
Some dispersed tropical bathrobes will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain generalizes late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense changes in temperature in the U.S. will be observed due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes this involves drastic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the central U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will try to recover and re-expand.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., a warm early October is expected, with widespread temperatures going to be around 26 degrees from the Southern Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures as high as 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high chances of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's appearance
More than 20 million people followed the heartbreaking testimonies that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, gave Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the policy was still on hold and the media were interrupting its usual schedule to rebroadcast Friday’s latest news: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a state of drunkenness and that he tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company accounted for the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it’s an audience similar to that of a playoff or Oscar football game.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s designation, was the leading channel, averaging 5.69 million viewers during an all-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him Friday morning as he tried to climb into an elevator to attend an appearance before the Judiciary Commission.
While receiving these reproaches, broadcast live on CNN, he was downcast.
“Looking at my face,” one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He continued, “You have power when there are so many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, he would tell more in his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and radio broadcasters were broadcasting it all live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Senate to be voted on.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate over the next week, which some Democrats had been asking for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was fundamental, as it became clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “doing politics” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “doing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers’ alleged Brexit plan, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to levy each other’s tariffs was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree homicide charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A $350,000 bond has been set, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge District Court of Instruction issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police forensics lab, Southern University police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked local police forces for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“These are the things people always care about,” Wade said.
A Volcano Casts Ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police as thousands took part in opposition demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes in later hours and police used batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups, with messages such as “neither forget nor forgive”, confronted unionist protesters with the cry of “Viva España”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, though the turnout was low, as people who were against the secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to avoid a rally in support of the National Police.
The demonstration went ahead, but she was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit narrow, victory in last December’s regional elections, pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detained, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pretrial detention since late last year, announced that he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for hitting a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly hitting a Londonderry home with a car.
The incident occurred Thursday around 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the entrances and the building itself.
At some point, you may have shot yourself into the car with a crossbow.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by winning the second loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as head coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference. Gary Holt's came in second, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard’s have yet to win any away wins and next Sunday they face the Hearts, the leader of the table with eight points of advantage.
Earlier, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their winning streak in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still not savoring defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a blunt visitor
Holt's team had to have gone one step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson outstripped the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the goal, and then Alan Lithgow took the shot after being interned to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the goal.
The host team was content with letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with standing ball plays.
That’s how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free throw and Livingston sought an entrance, with a combined play from Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who struck the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession, but could not pass the defense of the host and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
That game continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor rejected Scott Pittman's shot by one kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another Livingston move.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly entered, but they were always clear. Two penalty requests were rejected, one after Halkett's entry over substitute Glenn Middleton and one for a hand.
Livingston's "Phenomenal" (analysis)
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an upward trajectory.
His style of play and squad have barely experienced changes since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt's way of strengthening the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they were short.
They lacked to materialize the moves, as they only managed to get into the opposing field once, which is a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters rallied nearby to see its president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Deptford traffic accident: A cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford, southeast of the city, toward 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by the paramedics, but he died right there.
The accident comes after another cyclist died after being run over by a vehicle that broke out on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from Saturday’s crash site.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform their relatives.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured After Riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation produced in a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Center Directorate.
Riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still going on.
Specialists from an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, involving eight inmates and affecting a pavilion.
Officers received assistance for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time behind bars.”
Long Lartin Prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after an inmate attacked him.
In addition, riot control agents were asked to come to prison in October last year to deal with a serious altercation in which prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (arid areas could benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen earlier this week when the last collections of Hurricane Rosa crossed the desert’s southwest, at risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had preserved their tropical storm state or depression within a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rain, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Shoe in Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of flash floods, Rosa’s rains can be considered a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico’s Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum gusts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to recur in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"Torrential rains of between 7 and 15 centimeters are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters," as reported on weather.com.
Rosa will then head north from Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then head south from Arizona to Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger to Rosa or her remains is heavy torrential rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects in an assassination attempt after another 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains “stable.”
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, Somerset Police said.
The agents have made an appeal to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the pettiness and anger' of Democratic Party
“To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the merciless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered the pettiness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “Americans saw the cunning, quality and bravery” of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a lawyer with an admirable record of serving the public,” he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh’s candidacy when discussing the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“It’s five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t show up, but it’s a race,” he said.
"That's why I'm going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates."
Trump said Democrats are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first key Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to be held no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia earthquake and tsunamis, the number is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves ravaging the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When yesterday it was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it ravaged everything that was on land,” said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He added that some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Technology Evaluation and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s major earthquake was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “major” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the 300-km coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake’s epicentre.
Communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received much criticism for failing to report that a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a footage taken by an amateur and shared on social media, you hear a man standing on the top floor of a building warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, carrying ahead buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately validate the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but evacuated people still need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under tarpaulins installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as relief groups were rolling out disaster assistance gears, some people lamented that the displacement of experienced aid workers to Palu was not being allowed.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staffing of foreign personnel can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a catastrophe at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn’t happened yet.”
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of those still missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that shed some light on the desolating stories written by natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small child was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandon, instructor of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
“From my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the release of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the festival that was held on the beach.
However, their messages showed only one check mark in gray, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM reload in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed a Brink employee reloading an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the leisure center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man “came running after Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of the money destined for recharging.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will begin to be called Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
It’s been a while since 41-year-old West was nicknamed Ye, the name he used as his title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance to him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year as he talked about the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s you, it’s us, it means us.
He went from being Kanye, which means ‘the only one,’ to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in uppercase or lowercase, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO vows not to use army against civilian population
Andres Manuel López Obrador, Mexican president-elect, has vowed never to use the military against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would “never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were entrenching across Latin America.
López Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving them monthly grants to study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its I.A. funding.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in AI research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and I.A. professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments then emerge from the I.A. announcements from various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the No. 1 in innovation in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. We look forward to the next breakthrough in the field of I.A.,” Lee says.
Double funding means double the chance of the next big achievement at I.A. being achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that beat Othello’s top American player, and later served as executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China subsidiary.
Lee gave recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the next, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to put a lot of effort into getting government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired top people from universities to work at I.A.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people from academic institutions just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to attract partners from the industrial and academic fields, while the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission has not taken any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether they will change the name of their country
Macedonians decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their name would change to "Northern Macedonia," a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim of its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, the majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the vote will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
In the referendum ballot, the following question was asked: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at one o’clock in the afternoon, no irregularities had been reported.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their votes.
“I’ve come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote in Macedonia’s referendum on a name change for the country that would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and removed chairs in front of tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter like Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide the much-needed investment Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favor, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after filing his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published Monday by the Policy Research Institute said that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV, from Macedonia, revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
Should it fail, it would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch this: Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero dodges all of Brighton’s defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling shattered Brighton's defense in the 2-0 win Manchester City won Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the midfield at the start of the play.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He evaded a defender before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Agüero has some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League competition.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that move, Agüero received the ball deep within Brighton's territory.
He made a nice ball pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before directing Sterling to the second stick.
The Sky blues forward threw the ball into the net just before he stepped out of bounds.
City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 am at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the party to the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the fight by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the mound Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they, who triumphed against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League, still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still pursue their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver audience will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t you want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but seem inclined to let Scherzer launch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington’s right-handed record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump gives a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court selection, when discussing the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
It’s five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s one of the most important. I don’t run, but it’s a race, so I’m going from one place to another struggling to get great candidates,” he said.
“We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all the necessary means, you see meanness, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to get over it to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“We’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, saying the Democrats “were angry, they were bad, they were horrible and they were fake.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee appointing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the public's cries.
“Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I'm waiting for an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of views.
He is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I’m the last in a row of Labour Party Members of Parliament who are told it’s not welcome, and just for saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible national security economic policy on Europe, and it is ironic that these were issues where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I’ve been a member of the local Labour Party Parliament, that’s exactly what Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a “kinder and kinder” policy is already more than forgotten, if at any point it was actually applied.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether or not party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues he once thought shared a similar political vision with began to expect him to radically change his mind and adopt positions he would never have agreed to, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, no matter what I say, there’s a social media slur demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions, and with every “censorship” motion or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice recommending that I keep my head down and not make myself hear so much and that I “would be fine.”
But I haven't gotten into politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a high school student, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my full-school classroom literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councilor or as a government minister.
I never hid my political ideas, either in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political stances or the areas in which I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand this urge to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is headed for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and utilities.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting as I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the game may have decided the end result to some extent, but Ayr certainly deserved the victory in this very entertaining match of Tennent's Premiership day.
They now top the table and are the only unbeaten team out of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to take better advantage of the opportunities, that awarded the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“They’ve tested us in every game and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie commented: “The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan for the match, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the opponent's disadvantage and Jason Baggot got an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, just in the half, he scored and turned a solo practice, which left the score in 17-5 in favor of Ayr in the break.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption from a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which they had to pull on the stretcher, and, as the game resumed, Ayr moved ahead with a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to reap the benefits of having one more man with an unconverted rehearsal by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for scoring Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson did a rehearsal when he was in the back of the maul advancing.
Climo turned it, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent Gregor Henry to the bottom to get the fifth rehearsal from the locals.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the restaurant sector
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems determined to move into the restaurant industry after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that season nine will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though a source at the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “blowing restaurant market.”
'The sea belongs to us': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen Pacific route
Sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings there are navy blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the longing to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice ruling on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course it is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit into the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is waging a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the past four years may have hindered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Likewise, Calzadilla denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime theme as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he said.
“Resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to end nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to deliver on promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come as Mike Pompeo, the U.S. secretary of state, appears to be on the verge of resuming stalled diplomatic talks on nuclear matters more than three months after this summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration to end the Korean War to subdue the North is a “chimera.”
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s seriousness of giving up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric oversized hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that enveloped the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons with jewellery, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of quirky masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation reminded a full diving team, snorkel and glasses included, while another looked like a molten ice cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you’re in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could start to be seen on the streets of shops.
The big hats come with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this hat so impractical that it flooded social media presented another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag as large as the model in a swimsuit that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "Next summer, I expect to see huge hats and beach bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are critical to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary exam results that is reinforced by the individual and collective successes harvested in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the highest level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the centers.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, it reaches his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the qualifiers, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest score.
The data, collected from the 74 centres that are part of the SCIS, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as a fundamental competence that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are on the same level as CTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that, of the reasons given by employers for the difficulties they encountered in filling jobs, 17 % were attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
Potential job opportunities that require languages are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of which career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically advance the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If they know several languages, especially those in developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centers will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools you can always choose from several languages taught by teaching staff specialized in this subject.
Independent schools in Scotland dedicate all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At the moment, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be considered "competencies for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Fans hoping to see LeBron James debut in their first game with the Los Angeles Lakers are about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason that will be held on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicks off a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate’s confirmation vote to fill the pending Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be viewed online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s appearances by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense over allegations of sexual misconduct and have put an early Senate confirmation vote on hold for at most a week as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November election take momentum.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign noted that the five rallies next week are intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and broaden the majorities they retain in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we go into campaigning,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight could attract supporters of “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have coverage in the Pittsburgh media,” as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates it dares to fight to keep hope alive in the face of Sunday’s individual matches.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging impulse pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
“They were six points ahead of us and now they’re four, so I guess that can be considered a little boost,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in their favor and plenty of reasons to be cheerful, among other reasons for the pair formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
Celebrating guttural cries rose in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the match in the 15th was received with a similar cry, of those who transmit that believe the American team has not yet been left out.
"What needs to be done is redouble the efforts and focus on the match," Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple from Europe has four of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way its energy flows with the bustling public make it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, the two at the same time in different holes.
Still, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four balls, after partnering with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn’t get out of.
But on Sunday there won’t be any help coming out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch closely because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the tips they give and the ones they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and is taking a big lead towards the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe advances 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a result of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods, scoring four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more endurance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
Jim Furyk needs to earn eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to defeat a discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who hadn't been too prominent in both games on Saturday, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome games, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, again became Henrik Stenson’s foursome couple, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in southwest Paris, Europe didn’t have it all on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as the benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They achieved an exciting 2-1 victory against Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the initial two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, a team recovering from a four-point difference in individual matches has only happened twice, though Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs one draw to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says ‘there is no chance’ they will be disarmed unilaterally first if they don’t have confidence
On Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened his distrust in the United States and that there was no chance that his country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling facilities for nuclear tests and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States," he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances, there is no chance that we will disarm unilaterally first.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important as he did not immediately reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump secured North Korea’s security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, including by objecting to a declaration of war termination,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced in full swing by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea had been the stakeholder in denuclearization instead of the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in a similar stagnation.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles to U.S. soil after “evil president” Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim a “rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in advancing disarmament, but said much remained to be done and sanctions needed to continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set deadline for this: “We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without non-compliance until we realize the definitive and fully verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo spoke to Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea denounced his “demands as those of a mobster.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all college students sleep longer in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the number one university in the world usually have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her senior year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were barely asleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a one-bedroom image, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it’s not going to change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He claimed that the culture of pride in “sailing the night” still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and a good quality sleep should be “the secret weapon” for students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, which is why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is for students to think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's Tomb Goal to Gerrard's Men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression away from home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first away win since February's 4-1 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as coach, leaving their team eight points behind the Hearts, out-of-control leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga’s attack came minutes before halftime and the under-inspired Rangers lineup was not up to par at all.
Now, the Rangers go down to sixth, Livingston to third, behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers may be in more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly threw an object from the visitor’s background.
Gerrard switched to eight of the starters who won the match against Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 Livingston players who drew a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his highly organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but the Livingston took better advantage of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored two minutes before the start, when Menga made a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs made an in-depth foul for Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send her out by the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he was penalized in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely struggling to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's boring pitch.
Although Livingston’s 34th minute goal went against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with a deep, standing ball play from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher snapped the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the steering wheel was passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to lead visitors to exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's could have gotten more lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a header corner that didn't get in.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a meeting with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTENDO... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
The accountant Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronado", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of jeans scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, it’s used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting on your headphones, you can hear the effect of waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer,” such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking patients’ immune cells and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a diatribe in favor of Trump wearing a MAGA cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore his cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to pound against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to someone white and ask myself how I can like Trump if he’s racist.
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began Matt Damon’s sketch show in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's scorn to social media.
It’s unclear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the post.
In addition, West told the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes wearing that cap.
“They messed with me.
I was told not to go out with my cap on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see how asleep I am?” and added that he was “going to put on his superman coat, because that meant no one could tell him what he had to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments received loud noises from the public on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: “The studio was totally silent.”
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West baffled many when he went out on stage to sing I Love it dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from conservative TPUSA group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE WOMAN.”
Karen Hunter, the host of an interview show, tweeted that West was simply “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying his music or his clothes, or supporting his art) who I consider is embracing and spreading an ideology dangerous to my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Her colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, not forgetting the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted stabbing murder charge at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at an east Belfast restaurant on Friday.

The defendant is expected to appear Monday in the Belfast Trial Court.
Prosecutors will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the male hero stereotype, saying those on-screen roles often conveyed to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes “something has gone wrong” and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of ?MeToo.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones cast member Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that it seems "quite important" to her to address this issue.
“Personally, it seems pretty important to me right now, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?”
Kit believes that television may have some responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity because of its masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that he is “weary of battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard’s play that tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he’s ever gotten out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, she gave me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly to parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced in its entirety, Chinese health authorities said at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by some 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT collective suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have calculated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from GOP senators and claims it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three U.S. GOP senators on the Wikipedia pages about lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said those allegations were driven by commentators and “far-right” websites.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies,” Waters said in a Twitter post.
Reportedly, the published information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted the information online during a Senate panel session regarding allegations of sexual misconduct made against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate.
The leak was made sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staffer, according to the Capitol.
“This groundless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not at all responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement prompted immediate criticism on the Internet, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“She disproves this information with anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests not the temperance needed to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He must not rebel.
You should not question the accuser’s motives.
It must maintain calm and serenity.”
Fleischer apparently wanted to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very serious,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations.”
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they are held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff.”
Johnny English review: Back in action. Rowan Atkinson's spy parody gets short
Now it has become a tradition to look for nods to Brexit in any new film with a British focus. It seems that this is what to do with this new installment of the parody action comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satire about how clearly nonsense we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his salty eyes and inexpressive face, has renewed his license to put the paw for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking movie territories.
Of course, he’s the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to squander glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that kind that played a single note on the theme of Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, it was originally based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in Barclaycard's already forgotten television commercials, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last installment, there are one or two good moments.
I was delighted to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as the propellers collided against the helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for the physical comedy comes to mind, but the humor stays pretty short and is oddly superfluous, especially now that “serious” movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comic ingredients seamlessly.
Humor seems more aimed at children than adults and, to me, Johnny English’s absurd misadventures are not as witty and right as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the dismay of the serving agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and cornered character who’s watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character who’s almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to turn to someone who is retired.
That has to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches in a lame school, although he gives unofficial lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, since it is a spy academy similar to that of Rock School.
English is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his long-suffering former partner Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not used enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful deadly woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the interior of the Volta house.
They were definitely used thoroughly in that last sequence, but no matter how funny and creepy, the whole still conveys a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do real justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies it is developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but charges five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan that the British would work with four days a week, but charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business owners to allocate savings from the AI revolution to workers, giving them an extra day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would “fit” into the party’s plans and economic agenda to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
This shift to a four-day week has received support from the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: A review of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day work week is definitely an issue that the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to back such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At the moment, however, not all of the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not part of the party’s policy and will not be discussed at this time.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his idea of bringing about a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to regain the powers of “anonymous directors” and “benefited” from companies that provide utilities.
The shadow minister’s plans also include the idea that current shareholders of water companies will not recover their full shareholding, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds where 10% of private sector companies’ shares are to be allocated to employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to $500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation around Kavanaugh and whether it could make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for confirmation as a Supreme Court magistrate for at least a week and also raises the question of whether the findings that are concluded could influence any Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to air Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could bring out information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, the allegation came out and I asked him, ‘Did you do it?’
He was firm, resolute, sharp.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immovable.
“I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and would ignore the indictment,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she names have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive poster of stars gathers for an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people travel to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a number of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else that serves to raise awareness about your goal of ending poverty.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved 12 years after reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of so-called “clictivism,” which is called the stance we take when we think we’re doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have gotten world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its shares, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid out or raised.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is “The Power of Nutrition”, a partnership of UK-based investors and executors united in a common commitment to “help children grow and develop to their full potential.” To this end, they have proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country’s malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Cizen contributors.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador of “The Power of Nutrition,” told the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen contributor responded: “It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as human rights and anti-apartheid movements have already achieved, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we’ll feature at this year’s New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to carry out blockade of Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
“If necessary,” Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
“I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier of Europe,” he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
“The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, where appropriate, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In it, he compared Washington’s approaches in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he warned while pointing out that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims come true when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relieve it of its function to Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do so, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says will make Berlin hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which reaches a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is solely due to economic reasons and is yet another sign of unfair competition.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, in Moscow last September.
The American position, however, has met with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) said after a meeting recently between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being posed.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to make amends for our fractured government and finally for women to be among the leaders,” she said.
“After November 6, I’m going to seriously consider running for president.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a town hall appearance and said he was “taking the country the wrong way.”
“I’m really concerned about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said that “it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote.”
On Thursday, a poll was published in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run for the 2020 election.
58% of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% of respondents did, however, support their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation my son is going through, for everything that has happened since he came back, the other families who suffer the effects of PTSD and other wounds with which our soldiers return are very well aware of,” he told the audience at a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who “return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is that respect toward what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to their country.”
On Monday he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, charged with an episode of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to get a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district submitted a “friendly” letter Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name has not been revealed in the “Grace v. Sessions” case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner “and her children, who are members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these Grace-defending states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of international, federal and state law.”
“Under federal law, all applications for asylum must be made unsuccessful under the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” the amicus curiae states.
Lawyers also said in the letter that a policy that denies immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy by claiming that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and “assume a necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“People who leave their countries of origin may apply for asylum on the grounds of persecution or threats based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said when he announced this directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll rises in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
“The situation is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her baby with a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute there are ambulances with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search among the few drowned belongings left in an effort to recover what they can.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous aftershocks, also very strong.
He couldn’t help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to get safe.
I was trapped in the wreckage of the collapsed wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, where he and his family were in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're all right."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Bullying” with “Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily payroll supplement in Iowa’s best-selling Des Moines Register after accusing China of wanting to meddle in the U.S. Congressional elections on Nov. 6, something China flatly denies.
Trump’s indictment of Beijing’s attempt to influence the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials pointed to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to post ads to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war that has led them to raise tariff levels on imports by both sides.
China’s countervailing tariffs that were applied at the start of the trade war were thought to fall to exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, which is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
As Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, China “is further intensifying that pressure with ad postings in our free press.”
“To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press by trying to publish a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, you see only a few discrepant voices and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that people in China can have about the troubling trajectory that is taking place in their country’s economy, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most relevant newspapers evaded the offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts say Republicans are moving away from women ahead of midterm vote with Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there may be a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term ballots.
The emotions surrounding this have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have stated that they want to move forward with the vote.
“In such matters it’s not possible to back down,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s latest attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation was enough to calm down voters disgusted with the matter.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget it tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters who gathered at the Senate gates chanted “November is coming!” as Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is out of the box,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the impact is already very relevant and, in fact, it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among undecided suburban women and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who don’t usually vote even if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony in which he detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that there could be a setback if Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
“This matter has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, NBC News reported.
“It’s no longer just a matter of committee voting or the final vote, not even whether Kavanaugh is on the bench; it’s also about how Republicans have handled all this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they don’t know who they should believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are sided with the latter.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony definitively or likely, while 35% claim Kavanaugh’s testimony definitively or likely.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had lied in all likelihood or definitively during his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh raped her when she was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the technology legend. A company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “to dominate the world.”
“It has to be now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so users can create their own “online personal data storage” or POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
One thing that is unique about personal online data storage is that it is the user who completely decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes, and skills needed for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the included developers who were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could build their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change is going to be introduced where all of their business models are completely modified overnight.
“We’re not going to ask for permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that “its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the net neutrality debate.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the cleric who won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergyman in the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Rev. Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew he had been awarded the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was “of a special symbolism” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned him the decoration for his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann guided his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage", advanced the line before reaching a canyon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “so great that I can never reach his height, but they were very enticing.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a wreath after the parade, which featured the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of an authentic hero is evident when such a large number of endorsements are shown to him."
MMA fans were up all night for the Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay up all night to see the whole Bellator 206 so that in the end you will not be allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose poster featured 13 fights, six included on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until early in the morning just to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the switch to cartoons as “a heavy joke.”
“There’s government regulation that regulates content that airs after 6 a.m. and this wasn’t appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they will modify the show to include British viewers in upcoming editions.
“When I think about the rebroadcast option, I think it can work,” Coker said.
"But it's at 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our own time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the schedule was changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can promise that next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally did. We tried to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we had a good time.
It is a very unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumphant.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn’t realize until he got to high school that “not everyone was like me.”
On Radio 4’s first Desert Island Discs show, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention in talking about gay rights was to convey “hope” to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him begin to downplay winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this mythical show, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
On Laverne’s first show, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, said he felt “inferior” to the rest during his childhood, because “it was not socially accepted that you liked boys and girls.”
He said, “To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has really given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he claimed, so he wasn’t disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to pass on that “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion declared that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, although he said the age difference had never been an issue.
“When you’ve lived so much since you were so young” (he went to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone the same age who’s gone through the same ups and downs as you.
The couple had a son in June who they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global outlook" had changed.
“If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have revolved around ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father would not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had the passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him I wasn’t going to be in the front row,” he said.
“I had his hand in my hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that exact moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine at an Olympics, there was nothing better,” he said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to reverse his form if he wants to prevent it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who was playing at the event every two years to set a record for the 12th time, was knocked out by Captain Furyk for Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has done so many times for the United States, the five-time majors champion had to settle for cheering at one point and, at another, trying to perfect his game on the field and be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the highest moment of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough continually punishes with erroneous blows.
And, if the field is no longer daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they’ve played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points lower at the start of the 12 individual games, started in an impressive way, Mickelson’s match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, he couldn’t say much more either.
“He perfectly understood the role he had today, he slapped me on the back and, surrounding me with his arm, he said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I thought they would be more, but that’s how it came out and that’s how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of us.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s mark of most Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the latest in a Ryder Cups trajectory that has never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
“He’s fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
“I think younger players have loved having it as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It brings a lot more than just playing.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn Knows Leadership May Disappear Very Soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that even if you get a substantial lead in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily turn into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to knock out the others by a minimal margin, winning 141-2-131-2.
"You don't stop reminding you that we did a great tournament at Valderrama; we did it at Brookline and we lost, we did it at Valderrama and we won, but for very little," Bjorn said, portrayed after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leading it with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story will teach me and everyone that this team is not over.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal to meet, which is to win this trophy, and that’s all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no more and no less, than the best players in the world.
Proud of what his players have done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to get ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is the individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you’re there alone, you put all your golfing skills to the test.
That’s the message that needs to be conveyed to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it’s time to put your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as couples, with exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both extremes in the last few days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe held the “Mednah Miracle”.
“I remember every word,” he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
“We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and got them out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and take on Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole route,” Bjorn said of their individual teams.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it won’t be made until at least next year due to faulty systems and progressively rising costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship leading the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery hampered the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as very reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, continued delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) to be outdated by the time they begin service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after it was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – half the staff on the former Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), instead of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in light of the recent warnings about the reduction of Germany’s naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is "running out of ships capable of deploying".
The officer said the problem has gotten worse over time, because the old boats were dropped but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been conducted in a state in the Scottish Highlands, attempts to discover how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
Everything that is found is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide upcoming conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as Daubenton shore bats and long-eared browns from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations on the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of bat calls and what species do it.
A report and a habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticidal papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind,
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts in the field, who are dedicated to conducting regular surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues.
The organization has even inaugurated Scotland’s first and only bat reserve in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it’s the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a fantastic bat zone,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there is still a lot unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks inside the properties, since a breeding colony can be inadvertently destroyed and 400 females and offspring could be killed, which would mean annihilating an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or annoy them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo Denies Rape Allegations as Lawyers Persecute German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled rape allegations as “fake news,” and says people “want to make themselves known” at the expense of their name.
His lawyers have been instructed to denounce the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which is where the statements were published.
The striker from Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of having paid $375,000 to hide the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already garnered 142 million followers just hours after the news broke, Ronaldo, 33, called the report “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false,” says the five-time Ballon d’Or winner looking at the camera.
“They just want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as always.
They want to become famous by just mentioning me, but I can't help it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appear in what they have called “an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was “99 percent” a “good guy” and that he had defrauded that remaining “one percent”.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consented.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she took photographs of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she had "terror at retaliation" and was concerned "about being humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old says she is trying to quash the deal, as she remains traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged assault occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has switched to Juve, an Italian football great for a €100 million contract.
Brexit: Britain would always regret losing automakers
Britain would “repent for life” if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of customs delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stoppages at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s general manager in Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns that automakers are referring to revolve around the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “just in time” mode, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to make custom cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on 29 March, there could be a border disruption that the sector says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to house the amount of material equivalent to more than one day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in that case, production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is “precisely calibrated to avoid such checks at the border crossings.”
“We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to take the opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“Toyota’s evidence, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful supply chain set.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run, added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the Unite union at the plant, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and convincing plan that delimits our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed another week,” as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The anticipation of whether Trump decides to fire the deputy attorney general or not and thus compromise Mueller’s independence has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone he himself was carrying to try to relegate the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied that it was true.
However, on Monday he went to the White House, amid news reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump (who at the time was at the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, though this would delay the Senate vote.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “No date has been set, it could be this week or another one could be postponed, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the march and I will inform the press, as I usually do.”
Some reporters would refute that claim: Sanders hasn’t held a press conference at the White House since Sept. 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting grandiosely, though he said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they brag."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, while citing without evidence: “We’ve contrasted those numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to be held, Sanders said, but “if the press has the option to ask the president of the United States directly, I think it’s a lot better than doing them to me.
We’ve tried to do it many times and you’ve seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visiting him.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week in New York, the president demonstrated why it was so, where he made a casual and, at times bizarre appearance to the journalists who were congregating there.
Secretary of State for Health writes to NHS Scotland EU workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at HHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to stay with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit were followed in which they chose to take the expected decisions this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible scenario in which there would be no agreement.
I know that all of this must be very baffling to you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that reinforce and enhance the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is without a doubt your home and we would love to continue counting on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie was surgically emergency after suffering a head injury on Saturday, when they lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee’s Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“He came to the band and he collapsed right there,” Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for in-depth examination.
A Tennessee State staffer told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, sophomore redshirt, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with whom he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be charged a higher farm transfer tax when they buy property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher farm transfer tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised with this measure will be used to shelter the “homeless,” according to new Conservative plans.
The change will neutralize the success of the Corbyn offensive to attract younger voters
The farm transfer tax increase will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to go to the "homeless"
The additional money raised by the tax increase on the transfer of estates to foreign buyers of property in the UK will go to aid for the “homeless,” Theresa May announced today.
The move is meant as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and bullying those with higher incomes.
The increase in the farm transfer tax will be levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will go to incentivize government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including also the rise in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s new-build properties are purchased by non-UK residents, causing rising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country’s wealthiest areas (especially in the capital) have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining very high prices on properties by eagerly buying land without intending to use it and urged Mrs May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the “shameful housing problem” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of evictions for no reason.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
“The dream of owning a house has become too hard for many people to reach and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real.”
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's coach says his "primary goal" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the Northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the League One (England’s third league division), three points from the first.
She moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a kid and it’s something he’s always done that he wants to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland leader include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear when he switched to such established names at such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, success for me is measured based on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
“The structure and facilities of this club undoubtedly correspond to those of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I’ve achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it should be.”
Ross has only been coaching for three years, having been an assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts coaching staff.
Afterwards, he helped Alloa recover from the downhill to the third division and made St. Mirren move from on the verge of the downhill to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalled referring to when he took over the Alloa.
“I always thought direction was the best thing for me, much more than playing.
It may sound weird, because it was good, I could make a living very well with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to deal with a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that job; however, in the direction I feel good.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’ve managed to do it, it’s the time of my adult life where I’ve felt better, no doubt about it.”

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but it has focused all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits fell by 4.8%, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “The heat of these days and the fact that England remains in the World Cup have still kept the pattern of the previous month of June in July, in which pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, although restaurants have fallen even further.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant business in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs that serve mostly meals also suffered from the heat, though not as drasticly as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to go out and drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose as much as 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM’s hospitality and leisure analysts said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Time and the impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the market of out-of-home activities.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year is going to be especially painful in the face of continued cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for gastronomic operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones they have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, performance data from 47 operating groups are collected and analyzed, with combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents’ backs
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
The survey, conducted on 20,000 high school students, revealed a growth in fake Instagram pages
News has heightened fears of sexual content being posted
20% of students said they have a “main” account that they show to their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced on fake Instagram accounts, a photo-sharing reference site.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being posted.
About 20 percent of students said they had a healthy “main” account that they showed to their parents, while they had other private accounts.
A mother who happened to come across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website saw how a teenager encouraged others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by the independent Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC), found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create Internet spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the direction of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of directors of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track and field athlete and her president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from their great experience internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from having her in their board of directors,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I like to be the spokeswoman for the athletes and hope to be able to contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine if I recovered or to what extent I would recover.
It’s been exhausting, but I managed to fully recover, I had to learn to walk again and I’m currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the sacaleches where mothers with cows are compared divides the opinion on the Internet
A breastfeeding company has split public opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what is theoretically the “first silent breast pump in the world,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a somewhat ironic music video showing mothers telling the freedom the new milk extractor gives them.
Four royal women dance in a barn full of hay as a dance floor, along with some cows, with lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Ordn them, ordn them, I'm feeding their babies, ordn them, ordn them, ordn them, I'm milking my women."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created a lot of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the “horrors” of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to be able to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after they give birth.”
The Elvie milk extractor fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: “Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: “What a more insane announcement.”
However, other people defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted the song was "disenchanting."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I still breastfed, I'm sure I'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but I don't turn it around anymore.
It’s a product genius,” one woman told us.
Another person commented: "It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a breastfeeding pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet pumps placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who take their milk out with the pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is totally quiet, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly engages inside the breastfeeding bra, which makes its wearers able to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD, comments: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breastfeeding pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and approachable way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded down the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Discreetly Displaced to Texas Border Camp
The number of detained immigrant minors has seen a considerable increase, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has remained practically at its usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would endanger their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“About 80% of sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In their effort to prosecute minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to workers in the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for protection will be deported as soon as possible.
According to shelter workers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Advocates say these concerns are heightened even more in larger facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked due to their size.
In addition, moving to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country’s war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly."
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said they were given the right conditions for them to return and blamed “some Western countries” for “sowing irrational fears” that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in Idlib’s last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and has expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front (linked to al-Qaeda), who will “be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, an impeachment or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, peak ratings have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for major nightly news shows.
“It’s a strange attraction that we haven’t yet understood,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of “Designated Survivor,” an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride you made in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” was the reply Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families can reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information crosses the line when you realize that you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000-dollar ostrich leather hunter (“a garment of excessive pride,” in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of scabies.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s in part what makes it all look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, when he tells us about the alternating cast of Trump’s show and his daily twists on the plot (whether going into a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode if you don’t want to be left behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day off the north coast of Kauai, but he was a refuge indoors watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a string.
“I remember when in those days we were doing all this program madness and people were telling us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows in the House’s tightest midterm elections
Not surprisingly, the influx of money is coming to Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, whose structure is recently redesigned, has Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another re-election candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a campaign funding contest between the party’s main financial arms, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although after it backtracked.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” the department’s spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received help of around $140 million in 2017 for, among other issues, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that they intended the conference to go ahead, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, diplomats say, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to treat the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next planned step could be special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also believed to be investigating the possibility that Trump’s campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to stand before voters again, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionalities, and I don’t suggest that Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the contest.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to strike a coup against Hitler. It was only necessary that the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is speeded up or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these tipping points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in good shape since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the Times’ explanation isn’t accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his Supreme Court office is upheld despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these exams, we will find a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial home.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“We managed to get a good point, as Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game thinking we could get something and we got out with a point.
Maybe we could have achieved victory in the end, but overall, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went all out and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they already got a good result in the previous match. But, with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now you notice a general atmosphere that everything will go well.
The team is fine, the guys are enjoying it very much and we are having a good training.
I’m hopeful that we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.”
Fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose sleep
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few people talk about this with their relatives.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes in advance enough.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to get attention, as those options can be a cost-determining factor.
Incorporate your financial advisor into the conversion, as it can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-worth hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses, or insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of legal battles.
Ensure that you obtain a health care power to designate a trusted person who oversees your health care and ensures that professionals fulfill their own wishes in case they are unable to communicate.
You can also prepare a power of attorney for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always up to date.
"It's not just finance that's at stake: what doctors do you have to treat with?" asks Martin.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned.”
A man was shot several times with a carbine in Ilfracombe.
They have repeatedly shot a man with a rifle as he walked home after going out at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and police have appealed to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said.
With communications blocked, aid officials have been unable to obtain any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is a hierarchically inferior administrative region to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but they are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Belt of Fire, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffers earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that affected 14 countries and took the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, and caused a tsunami to hit the southern coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that shattered dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of major earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report released Saturday by Alaska state police.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took away his phone.
Palin has been ordered pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court Saturday, where he declared himself "definitely innocent" when asked for his statement, the chain said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering in reporting a crime of domestic violence, and possessing a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he punched him in the face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck Indonesia’s Sulawesi Island on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake occurred right next to downtown Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital.
There are several videos that circulate on social networks and show the moment of impact.
Hundreds had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Unusually Seek Death Penalty for New York Terrorist Attack Suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal offense since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental van last October to carry out a bike lane attack on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed all eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the death penalty intent notice, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury presented Saipov with a 22-charge indictment that included eight charges of organized crime-assisted murder, typically used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be raised in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction with a life sentence with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved,” Patton said.
The Saipov defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Take Charge of Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that Britain “would already have left” if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Prime Minister May faces to reconcile her divided ranks has further highlighted when a group of pro-permanence Tories have joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep up the plan for the compromise that was signed in Chequers amid attacks by pro-Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and “chaos.”
Congressman Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers’ plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have already left,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I’m going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers.”
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be slavish.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the European Union is completely false.”
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: “I’m just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it and it is not popular among our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their posts when they keep their promises.”
Farage told reporters that politicians would have to “feel the heat” if they were seen to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We will mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, pro-stayers roamed the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists were waving banners of Tories Against Brexit after the group’s presentation this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they had with a party application during the conference's inauguration.
“These are the same people who tell us they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers every chance to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider every chance of running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will run for reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
Saturday’s event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes there being a woman at the top.”
Arrested for gun murder of Sims LSU player
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, has been arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately caused her death,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the crime scene, holding a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-meter-tall Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games last season, starting in 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team’s orders would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the pits and let Hamilton run in the group's queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out strongly one lap later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after an action with the wheels almost glued together that made the Ferrari driver had to reluctantly leave the free interior at the risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and placed seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race as he clung to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he went into pits on lap 44, but could not increase his pace on the remaining eight laps by regaining Raikkonen's fourth position.
It’s been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job of getting a perfect match," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing her of sexual assault on Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, disgusting and false.”
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last few days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false,” he said.
"When you read the posts and leaks, and then say, 'But if I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn’t,” he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t filter her story,” Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.”
But his refusal didn’t seem to sit well with the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented: “I’ll tell you one thing: That’s really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and repugnance, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the 5-3 return game in Dundee.
The Giants scored a two-goal lead thanks to attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie won the local draw before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe’s men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assistance for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan put the local team back on the look of playing in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to equalize the match in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched the match with a knockout in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game by reaching the end of the second half and secured victory with his team's fifth goal by approaching the end.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies so hundreds of people can escape in earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many find themselves trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his comrades fleeing to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his seat at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu’s control tower.
He stood firm to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand people, with the national disaster mitigation agency claiming that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many corpses under the ruins and many people have not been contacted," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, who will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute comes an ambulance with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are they ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared, having said that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that a male passenger could not be seen since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
“That’s an extremely good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes says he and other travelers managed to advance through water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors carrying out dock upgrading work nearby also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Aviation safety data indicates that 111 people have died in airline crashes registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors finished their arguments Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
She explained to the jury how she used cell phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, thus contradicting her earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took to the podium on Saturday and testified that he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford pickup that night, Sanford said he was “lying, because my pickup was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records indicated that they met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is Mindful Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed says hip hop has moved away from its origins in political messaging and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make mindful hip hop popular again.
Performers like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York City nanny sues a couple for firing her after a "racist" text
A nanny in New York will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to an extortion case.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay at discovering that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day at work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTHER BLACK PERSON," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her paw shuffle, an “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and was instead expecting a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Maurice received the pay for the day job and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving compensation of $350 a day for the six-month position of internal work for which he had been hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show you that things aren’t done that way,” he told The Post on Friday and added, “I know it’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they are racist by saying Maurice’s termination of employment was the most reasonable, as they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
“My wife had sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the lawsuit as an “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to go for someone like that?
That’s not a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has rushed to report the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers might not identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It was difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
It’s so funny to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman, was inspired by a toy bear to write the children’s book, he was confident that his job would be turned down, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was somewhat “sweet” after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” added that her father was very proud of her ultimate success.
“He was a very quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost like you had a son who achieved something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad would call regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he wasn’t expected to make it,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got Nad’s call to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be ready with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were slowly depleting and leaving his system.
She had died early and everything was going out.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, oblivious to the terrible experience that was going on.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I shook my head and tears fell on me all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning put on cards to prevent suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said their smile would light up anywhere.”
However, he left the job before he died, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards "so people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don’t feel silent, you have to talk about it.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or anything like that,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he didn’t even look at them.”
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they have to overcome it: "Leave a void in the whole family.
It has left us shattered.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
“I thought if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a time-limited, scope-limited investigation), maybe we could bring some unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going downhill” amid a partisan standstill.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigation to take place?
His refusal is entirely due to chronology.
If, as expected, Republicans perform poorly, their attempts to get the man they want for the country’s highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling on senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's deserter numbers 'fall' with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and high tariffs levied by human traffickers, had been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on this.
The vast majority of northern defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and is often repatriated.
North-South relations, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed broadly to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will in no way be the first to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House, said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a “hysteric” and was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she’s hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and entangled as he talked about his family and his high school years.
On the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the accusations against him “grotesque and clearly coordinated slander” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed his bias against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in office and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll just say one thing: if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won’t be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, you won’t even be fit to be in the court you’re in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to think it’s all right,” Pelosi said.
And women have to wield it.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and she can't let go without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, do I?"
She went on to say, “I was really helped by a woman who was an executive at some company and who told me that she was crying when she got angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
“No, I’m angry.”
And then I kept going with what I was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once that I found myself crying with inexpressible anger. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the moustache and dragged me down a ladder.
“Don’t let them ever see you cry,” he said.
“They have no idea you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad because they think they’ve cornered you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which she had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came to the conclusion that there was no reason not to explore the idea of her running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me between laughs 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As the campaign was already well advanced, it fell behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not enter the race again unless it raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000 gave her only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on attracting voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she became entangled.
“The logical thing would have been to think he had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said, recalling the reaction from the press.
“You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
“Did he cry?”
U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvos from the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while there is still a long way to go before the battle is over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion ($150 billion) in products, charging taxes on half of products entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent retaliation, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match U.S. attacks, and the world’s second-most powerful economy is unlikely to loosen soon.
Getting Washington to back down would mean yielding to demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, pressures from the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can set the stage for a plunge in the economy in either country is actually far more dangerous than viewers have acknowledged so far,” said Abigail Grace, Asia-focused associate researcher for the strategic cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions were improving.
“The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are now in place.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
Another six million people are still living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris (France).
The U.S. now has six consecutive defeats on European soil since it last won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the necessary 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his point of departure into the water in the 16 par 3 hole, thus admitting his defeat against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament’s current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell 5-4 to the European team's lowest-ranking player, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world’s number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio García, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most tournament wins of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a very tough year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to get the cup back.
It is an achievement of the whole team and I am very happy to have been able to help," said an excited Garcia after the European team's victory.
He is now passing the torch to fellow golfer John Rahm, who already defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 Sunday in a singles match.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, as I grew up watching this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we ruined it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it's up to us to tilt our heads.
They have surpassed us.”
