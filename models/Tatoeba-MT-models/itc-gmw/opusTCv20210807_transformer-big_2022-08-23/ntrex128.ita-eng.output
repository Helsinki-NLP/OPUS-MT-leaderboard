Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned about "making the figure of clowns"
Some members of the Assembly are dismayed at the proposal to amend their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This proposal arose as a result of the plans to change the name of the assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the entire political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party is concerned that it “can rhyme with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means asshole and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said he was “open” to changing the name, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet.
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the English pronunciation of the letter U in Yorkshire.
The Assembly committee, which is currently being drafted for the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what members of the Assembly will be called will obviously be a topic of debate for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found broad support for the possibility of calling the Assembly the Parliament of Wales.
As for the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission has expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option has received more consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to come forward with a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include further changes to the operation of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AM and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its requests for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take the result of the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay in order to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s Bells Shut Down While Harlem Churches Are in Trouble
“The elders I talked to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
"There is none of them today."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people attend regularly."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets won’t last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they’ll go back to where they started.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who won’t help the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he says, “and for that reason they will hasten the time when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that much of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by fraternities before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The early white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin’s was acquired by a black congregation headed by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against retailers on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners were planning its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who switched to a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin’s in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by lay leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese was “trying to charge the costs” on the parish assembly even though the latter had not been involved in hiring architects and entrepreneurs sent from the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures Thirteen-Year-Old Scuba Diving for Lobster Fishing in California
Official sources say a shark on Saturday attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream and swam up to him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first it was just excitement about catching a lobster, but then "he realized the guy was screaming, 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His entire clavicle was torn,” he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
“I shouted at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Beach ranger Captain Larry Giles said in a news release that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the area, but that it had been declared not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper chest.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans a push towards the UK beauty products industry
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with lanes dedicated to department store beauty products assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the UK’s major push to the 2.8 billion pound beauty market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household goods sectors decline, the largest lanes dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and adopted in more stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are hunting for new ways to use shelf space once dedicated to televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those present in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of boutique tricks so that most products are vegan – a quality increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will experience licensing at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a shift to buying small amounts of groceries daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to do more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since it acquired the two chains about two years ago, and that strategy has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to restore enamel to its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets into supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with four stores adding an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look of our beauty products departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and comfortable locations make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby walks out of 11-million-pound deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11-million-pound contract with her trending brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer has time for his Truly housewives and accessories brand.
The pair's activity had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby left her Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, furious after retiring from their lucrative last-minute trending branding business to focus on her exceptional new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was "furious" when the golden TV girl admitted during a tense meeting at her trading empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth 1.5 million pounds - didn't leave her enough time to devote herself to their brand of Truly housewives and accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and it was estimated that it would double Willoughby's estate, estimated at around 11 million pounds.
As Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would commit her for the next twenty years.
His decision to leave left everyone involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the abandonment of the presenter of This Morning, one of the UK’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions because of heavy investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and because of possible delays to the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby devised Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent the holidays together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a guest on ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity” show.
A source close to Jones said last night that he “doesn’t want to comment on his business.”
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media to make a comment that some would consider "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the “newscaster.”
"I didn't give up anything."
He pointed out that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first one in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not observe an “equivalent response” from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament operations.
Instead, he pointed out, the US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea, we are achieving very good results," he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationships with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded field, we would have about 200 people right here in front of us,” Trump said.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake devastate island, claiming hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, an essential requirement for activating international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it’s a bit complicated,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is continually subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common structure on other coasts.
The obvious lack of a tsunami siren in Palu, although the alarm was given, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading for Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo has put Indonesia’s sledging infrastructure at the center of his election campaign and has poured money into roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds has hit Joko’s administration as it prepares for re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of the religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes due to street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, fighting using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge draws against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a 89th minute point on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 meters from Chelsea's door, with his team down 1-0.
He touched the left ball before shooting at the second pole.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it turned towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga, sacking himself into the net.
“Just try to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and I gave him a touch and I didn’t think too much and I pulled.”
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after the 25th-minute goal scored by Belgium star Eden Hazard.
Blue’s centre-back passed Mateo Kovacic on heels before skimming away near the midfield and shooting in Liverpool’s midfield.
Kovacic made a quick halfway pass.
So he made a beautiful move that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard passed the defense and finished on the second pole with a left-handed goal over Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at São Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami casualties in Indonesia rise to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, the country’s disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Numerous people have been reported trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings following the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck the country on Friday and generated waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been littered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to appeal to anyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have information that is very important to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location of the meeting this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police said they are currently informing the victim's family members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps repeating, "It's terrible."
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the delimited area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the delimited area controlling the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about this is invited to contact ?MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating the 247 register of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "rewriting history"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects from England performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick’s proposal a “madness” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in light of the current debate over the removal of the statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasty during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe still needs to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressures, in his case of course of the monarchy.
Whether this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-seventeenth century conflict defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure representing a part of that fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated.”
Pig killer rips off a Chinese farmer by killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery, covered in blood near a piglet at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door of a nearby piggy was open.
He claimed that in the piggy there was a large male pig with blood on his nose.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250-kg pig had torn the breeder apart, according to the statements.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and jagged,” said the cousin identified with the surname “Wu,” as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people as police gather evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer's death.
Although rare, cases of human attacks by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to hunt the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst.”
“They just want to play.
They’re playful, very curious... they don’t want to hurt.
Just show them the right amount of respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa's debris will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the US
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains over northern Mexico and the southwestern coast of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5 ET on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a storm is forming over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, she will begin to push strong tropical humidity northward in the southwestern part of the US.
Pink will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture in contact with approaching sacking will create heavy and vast rainfall in the southwestern area in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm of rain is expected in some areas of the southwest, particularly in much of Arizona.
It is possible to experience sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could make river canyons flood and thunderstorms will bring wind to puffs and lift dust.
The approaching plunder will cause heavy rain locally on part of the southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more extensive in late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will descend on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be strong temperature swings over the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature variations over short distances.
An exceptional example of significant temperature differences in the central U.S. will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the residual heat of summer will try to increase and expand again.
Warm early October is expected for much of the central and eastern U.S., with 26oC from the Southern Plains to the northeastern areas.
In New York, it will be possible to reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, a temperature of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate strong chances of above-average temperatures for the eastern USA until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people followed on six television networks Thursday the gripping deposition by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute twist on Friday: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Commission that it is 100% certain that Kavanaugh tapped her intoxicated and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposition, said he was 100% sure this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people named by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting viewers following programs in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, this is an audience similar to that for a football playoff game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all networks, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS operatives Friday morning as he was insulted by demonstrators as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He remained low-eyed for several minutes while being reprimanded and broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh’s nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the allegations against the candidate over the next week, as requested by minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “doing politics” on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of letting the European Union “do politics” with Britain’s future and jeopardize national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside the prime minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Brexit deal, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect their respective duties is “absolutely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Suspect of Death of LSU Player Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson’s DNA on them, reports the CBS-affiliated WAFB television station.
After questioning Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
The East Baton Rouge forensic office issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the police science lab, Southern University police and local citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the area law enforcement for their commitment and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20.
The 198 cm forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what you care about at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano sprinkles with ashes Mexico City
The ash coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity had increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center was checking the various rumbles and shakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash lining car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano that lies 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police teams and thousands of people joined opposition demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by riot police targeted police officers with eggs and threw powdered paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
There were more clashes during the day with police officers who used batons to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of separatists chanting “We will not forget, we will not forgive” confronted the Unionist demonstrators shouting “Long live Spain.”
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
Tensions remain high in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although turnout was low, and Catalans opposed to secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop with violent clashes the referendum that was taking place at seats throughout the region.
Independence groups camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I’ve seen my parents cry for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked,” she explained.
Despite winning a key victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement’s most well-known leaders finding themselves in voluntary exile or in jail awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest with his phone in support of police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both factions.
“The situation is getting tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will run in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Presenting me as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Stealing House With Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly hit a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a crossbow at a certain point.
Menga's attack marks Livingston's 1-0 victory against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston marked the victory
Livingston already promoted stunned the Rangers by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as director of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference as Gary Holt's team moved into the second division with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team is therefore without a home win in the Premiership this season and will face next Sunday’s first in the Hearts standings, from which they are separated by 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its series of division wins by staying undefeated for six games, with coach Holt having yet to see a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
The Livingston wastes opportunities against incisive guests
Holt’s team should have been in the lead well before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow was only able to kick out of the door after entering to meet Craig Halkett's header on the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could have put visitors in trouble with kicks placed.
And that’s how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a penalty kick and the Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to move to Menga, which they were able to score from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated in ball possession but the host team’s defense had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn’t have to worry too much,
This pattern was maintained during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped from the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a throw out of another Livingston game scheme.
The crosses followed each other in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two demands for rigor, after Halkett's contrast with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for hand fault, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and collaborators have changed very little since their return to the top series, but Holt has to be given a lot of credit for the way he has been able to spur the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a masterfully organized defense, while Menga challenged Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the game.
The Rangers were not very inspired.
Despite the excellent performance in some moments with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below these standards.
Missed the last pass - only once they managed to penetrate the opponent's area - and can be considered an alarm bell for the Rangers, who are half-ranked.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at easing relations between NATO allies.
They clashed over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have motivated the intervention for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including numerous Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect dissent provoked by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeastern area of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the shot.
The accident happened months after another cyclist died, raided by a street pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday’s accident occurred.
Metropolitan police said authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses were diverted and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Wounded in Disarmament
Six prison guards were injured during a disorder at the male maximum security prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at the men’s maximum-security Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized agents "Tornado" were employed to handle the riot, which involves eight prisoners and is confined to a prison wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to contain an ongoing incident at the Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison.”
Long Lartin Prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital care following an attack by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to intervene in the prison to quell a violent riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest of the desert, creating risks of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since the 1950s!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest area, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be positive as the southwestern area is currently experiencing a period of drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second-highest category,” weather.com reported.
Initially the path of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land through the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds at a top speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the colder waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected to arrive in Mexico by tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation is expected between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," weather.com said.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, then head through Arizona and toward southern Utah in the late evening of Tuesday.
"The main risk that may be caused by Rosa or her debris is heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern area of Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that such rains could generate potentially deadly flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Assault: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The authorities appealed to anyone who could have taken what happened with their phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘suffered for the badness and anger’ of Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the Democratic party’s “maliciousness and anger” during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, passionately and resolutely denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations of sexual violence against him decades ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified in court defending himself from the prosecution.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a jurist with unspeakable precedents in public service,” he said in front of crowds of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment by talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I really do,” he said.
"For this I fight hard for outstanding candidates."
Trump said Democrats are committing to “resist and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves that hit beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 18 feet (6 meters) high crashed onto the beach at dusk, sweeping away numerous people by killing them and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their beach activities and did not run away immediately, thus turning into victims,” Indonesian disaster control agency BNPB spokesman Purwo Nugroho told Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, homes, it hit anything on the mainland,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, crooked and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was perceived in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the strong Friday earthquake was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geography, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage may be greater along the 300-km (190-mile) coast north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicentre of the quake.
Communications "were totally paralyzed, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alarm was sounded.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming hectic way to warn the incoming tsunami people in the street below.
A few minutes later a wall of water crashed onto the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue interventions.
According to the authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia’s tsunami death toll rises to more than 800.
It's terrible.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where employees took refuge under tarpaulin shelters in the backyard of their office, on the way they encountered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even as rescue groups began the difficult start-up of rescue gears, there were some complaints that foreign rescue workers with extensive knowledge were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations state that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared an area of national catastrophe.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international assistance, but status has not yet been defined.”
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of the missing still held out hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was taken out of a dump.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the missing paragliding drivers.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“As a paragliding veteran, I’m carrying my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours after news broke about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single gray tick rather than two blue ticks.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM in the entertainment center and preparing to hand over more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "snatched up behind Brink's employee" and stole a purse with the money destined for delivery.
Witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information about the identities of criminals is invited to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When announcing the name change on Saturday, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously stated that the word contains for him a religious meaning.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
We went from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, our badness, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He’s just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed the name with or without hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population on the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use the army to repress the Mexican people.”
The soldiers had fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking hold across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
US should double funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in the AI industry, the U.S. should double its funding for AI research, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements by several U.S. government groups about AI, although a formal AI strategy is generally lacking in the U.S.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its programme last year: it aspires to be the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget in AI research would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we need a new revolution in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big success in the AI industry will be achieved in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat Otello’s American player with the highest score and later served as executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese section.
Lee recalled previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be held, in order to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders, it’s the multinationals,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically offered to AI PhD students,” he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its program for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations distribute funds to US researchers, poor quality of academic work is inferior in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a special commission for artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. order to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not registered activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted Sunday in a referendum on the possible change of the country's name to "North Macedonia," a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its demands for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its neighbours constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would harm the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has declared that he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about the possibility that the turnout will reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: “It agrees with NATO and EU membership and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece.”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to pay for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries since the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will respect the result of the vote to make it final.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in favor.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters had cast their votes.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia for the name change of the country that would open the door to NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and setting up the chairs in front of the curtains mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go in head-on, not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll released Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia, indicated that 57% of respondents planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of those 57 percent, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scores a goal avoiding the entire defence of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of defending Brighton during the 2-0 win from Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his point in the 65th minute seem extremely easy.
The Argentinian striker received a midfield pass at the start of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting to the free field.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated one defender before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
He then made a left pass, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right in the net.
"Aguero is having foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at that time.”
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball along his left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues striker pulled the ball into the net shortly before leaving the field.
City will fight against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who maintain an edge of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least one rematch with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
“Even if we play without a goal, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
“Why shouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a first pitcher for Sunday, but are said to be inclined to let Scherzer pitch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first pitcher for the 34th time, on Thursday ran a pitch session and would be the first pitcher on his normal Sunday off.
Washington's pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings for this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really working hard for this and I'm fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump continued: “We see this horrible group of radical Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using whatever means necessary, you can see the meanness, the meanness.
They don’t care who they can hit, who they have to overwhelm in order to get power and control back, because that’s what they want, power and control and we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of “resisting and hindering.”
“And it’s been possible to see it in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, bad, mean, and liars.”
She referred to the Senate Justice Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, spewing loud whistles among the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I look like a -- that was a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
It doesn’t tolerate people who say what they think.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, it wasn’t a big surprise.
After all, they are the latest in a series of Labour members to be told they are not welcome, and all because they said what they thought.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, all ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday’s Nottingham East Labour meeting states that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a member of the local Labour Party parliament, Friday night meetings were exactly like that.
However, today this is not the tone of numerous meetings and the promise of a "kinder and more polite" policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable for party leadership.
All of this began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect a reversal on my part and to take positions that I would never accept, whether it was national security or the European single market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – they follow invectives of insults on social media calling for my withdrawal, denouncing the politics of the center and telling me that I shouldn’t be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am luckier than my other colleagues because the comments I make tend to be political in nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insult levels.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of distrust or modification of the selection rules, the party narrows.
Over the past two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would have gone well".
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a pupil, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that had let my high school class literally fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local councilor or as a government minister.
I never hid my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way baffled by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of what I consider to be your best interests.
Chris Leslie is a member of parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeaten Ayr climb the leaderboard
Two late attempts may have somehow imbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun match of the Tennent championship day.
I'm now at the top of the standings, the only unbeaten team out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their boldness, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "You have to recognize Ayr's merit, they have better exploited our opportunities."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute goal, converted by Frazier Climo, but led Ayr to the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released from the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo increased Ayr's distance with a penalty before, just in half time, scoring and then converting a goal alone to bring Ayr to 17-5 at the interval.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long break due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was stretched out, and on restart, Ayr jumped back in the lead thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climus.
Ayr captain substitute Blair Macpherson received a yellow card and Melrose charged the man extra with an unconverted goal by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
However, the home team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a contrast to Climo without a ball, from the touch of rigor, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the advancing melee of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had done almost since restarting, after Rowe had picked up the football from the David Armstrong area and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to look for the fifth goal of the home team.
Still Game Star Seeks New Career in Catering
Still Game star Ford Kieran decided to move to the hotel industry after discovering he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays with longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth series will also be the show’s finale and it looks like Kiernan is thinking of a life after Craiglang.
According to official report lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to make statements, though a source at the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “prosperous catering trade.”
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters lined with tailoring in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Retrieving it is a duty.”
Across Bolivia without an outlet to the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in the hands of Chile after a bloody conflict over the resources of the nineteenth century is still alive, as is the desire to once again cross the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have perhaps reached the highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and obviously is waiting for the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of intermittent dialogue – Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia a sea outlet under the state’s jurisdiction.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year - has much to do with Monday's ruling.
“We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final rulings indicate that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morale’s belligerent rhetoric has undermined any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions as a result of what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was particularly expeditious.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile” and will have the opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit,” he explained.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as a political escapade.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen Without U.S. Trust
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm from nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to live up to the promises made at the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears intent on restarting stalled diplomatic talks after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an “illusion” that the continuation of sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration of an end to the Korean War could ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington warns of issuing the declaration without first having Pyongyang carry out major disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is willing to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows feature the latest trend in huge headdresses that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to enlarge your headgear collection or completely block the sun’s rays, look no further.
Stylists Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized headdresses on the catwalks for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have raged on Instagram this summer and these stylists have sent their captivating creations onto the catwalk.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like edge that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer’s hat and even a pineapple – but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have sewn lips and look more like a Hannibal Lecter representation than haute couture.
One creation resembled a diving suit with mask and glasses, while another looked like a loose ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the huge style statements, you’re lucky.
Style watchers predict that the huge caps could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats arrive in the wake of "The Bomb", the straw hat with a width of more than a meter that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that has invaded social media has sent another huge creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag almost as big as the costumed model that wears it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringe and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera's spring-summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect these big hats and beach bags to arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the designer has made such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 alumni across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further higher education, chosen careers and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector able to develop and adopt a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and demanded subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will come to his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will come to the heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t rely on English alone if we want to build relationships of trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages scored the highest.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students obtained the highest Chinese-lauded grade, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish obtained the highest grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject choice are considered at the same level as STEM (Science, Technology, Technique and Mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent institutes and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons employees indicated for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a viable job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking to 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff specializing in this area.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need for success, whatever their future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be determined for how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers’ six-game pre-season program.
“At this point in my career I don’t need friendly matches to prepare,” he said.
The timing of the meeting a West Virginia of Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a barrage of rallies.
This is the first of five planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for his choice to fill the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time will Trump’s election be and how can he be followed online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia online at via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week’s hearings by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over allegations of sexual violence with a Senate early confirmation vote pending for a week while the FBI is conducting the investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November election get a little boost.
So, President Trump’s campaign said these five gatherings over the next week are aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so critical to his schedule that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the campaign’s busiest season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, urging anonymity.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh media coverage," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he had won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in the queue in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Courage to Fight to Keep Hopes Alive Until Individuals on Sunday
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum movement is a totally invented sporting concept in which players firmly believe and never like in races like these.
Where would the motion be now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I'd say we're keeping a little bit of a bike," Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, four points ahead with another twelve at stake.
Americans feel like they have a bit of wind in their favor, as Spieth put it, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth has been ruthless from tee to green and is setting an example.
The festive guttural screams grew stronger as the game went on, sinking a crucial putt to make ends meet in Game Four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt that made them win the game in the 15 hole was greeted with a similar scream, which tells you he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
“You really have to put a lot of effort into worrying about your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable version of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but adorable couple is four by four and can’t do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and ninth hole Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the buzzing crowd reinforces the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal off a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European speeches of glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon made it to Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four-ball, when he was in pairs with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes drowned the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not even remotely get back up.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and don’t give, and the way the strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained an important lead on the final day but this foursome session has shown that the USA team has the courage to fight, which some, particularly Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup after ending Saturday’s fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score so far to Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, in an attempt to keep the trophy lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated on an irregular American team in the morning fourballs, winning 3-1.
The U.S. resisted more in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to recover the drawback.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known by the name "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a downed Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more net 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself for two games on Saturday, showed occasional glimpses of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned alongside partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – number one and three on the world chart.
Europe, however, has not achieved all the results hoped for on a pleasant and ventilated day south-west of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a gritty 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned from a four-point gap to singles, although as a starter, Furyk’s team only needs a tie to defend the trophy.
After being second best for two days, however, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea Refuses Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that maintaining sanctions was escalating the country's distrust of the United States, which in such circumstances would absolutely refuse to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any compliant response from the US," he said.
“Without trust in the United States there will be no security in our national security and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to unilaterally disarm first.”
Although Ri re-used the note of complaints about Washington’s resistance to “phased” denuclearization with which North Korea would be rewarded based on gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization altogether as Pyongyang has already done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The US insists on having ‘denuclearization first’ and increasing the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even opposes the ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion of those who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our mistrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader had announced at the U.N. earlier this week.
The minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the counterpart of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was markedly different from last year’s speech at the UN General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to target U.S. territory with North Korean missiles after “the president of evil” Trump called Kim a “missile man” engaged in a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in embarking on the disarmament path, but said much more needs to be done and that the sanctions will remain in place until North Korea's denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday he did not have a deadline, saying "whether it will take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
Cine and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “compliance with Security Council sanctions must continue forcefully and without exception until complete, final and ascertained denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions control North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn’t go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea had accused him of filing “gangster demands.”
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US adopted “compliant measures.”
He said Kim had explained to him that the “compliant measures” he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had pledged in Singapore and actions toward a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counter the growing culture of studying for whole nights powered by caffeine.
A university scholar noted that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He had the idea to start the course after a lecture he had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“A girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now, when I’m in my senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general manager of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a dormitory room, where students can select coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how lack of long-term sleep can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the “white night to study” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to lack of sleep being an ever-growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and good quality sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue, anxiety, he explained and even should serve to avoid gaining weight as lack of sleep takes the brain into starvation mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student enrolled in the faculty of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after taking one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar program of study before enrolling in this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm for when they have to go to bed, as well as when they have to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to falling asleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another out-of-home depression attack with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team was looking for the first away win from the February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 coaching games leaving his team eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and a short-inspired Rangers lineup never seemed able to draw.
While the Ranger now drops to sixth place, the Livingston rises to third, and only behind the Hibernian for goal difference.
And there could be additional problems coming up for the Rangers after Line Guard Calum Spence was cured for a head injury due to an object apparently thrown from the outside of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly overtook Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual line-up that tore a point at Hearts last week and would be pleased with how his well-trained team choked their opponents every lap.
The Rangers may have dominated by possession of the ball but the Livingston has better exploited the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's filtering pass in the first half sent Scott Pittman forward towards Allan McGregor's door but the midfielder squandered the opportunity.
A deep penalty kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defending partner Alan Lithgow was only able to pull sideways on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their game in the area of rigor.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been given a penalty at the end of the 15th following a clash with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers managed to shoot only twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not let himself be worried by Lassana Coulibaly’s header and a soft shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even for his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to handle a deep-placed kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the shift had an almost immediate impact as the wing threw a ball into Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself out of the goal line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased the detachment in the final stages, but McGregor objected to stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton filed a final penalty claim after a crossover with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the count continues... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those uncredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earbuds, you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Say it's just bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many types of cancer and are then re-injected.
An experimental trial of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and then those cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein “promotes the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar process of extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself into a pro-Trump diatribe wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was whistled into the studio during a Saturday Night Live episode after a concluding performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would nominate himself in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA cap, he began a rage against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How you like Trump, he’s a racist!’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he explained.
The SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star teased the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Commission against allegations of sexual violence brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the West's philippine recording was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had a bad time in the backstage because of his headgear.
“I was bullied in the backstage.
They told me, ‘Don’t go out with that cap on you.’
They bullied me!
And so they told me I’m an outcast,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said, "I would wear the Superman cloak because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love."
His comments spawned whistles at least twice from the public and SNL cast members seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with a person who told the magazine: "A deadly silence has fallen on the study."
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many with a performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from TPUSA Conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR TESTING THE MASS.”
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “what it is and this is just wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) who I believe is embracing a vomitable ideology that is detrimental to my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper friend Snoop Dogg called himself Snoop Lion and of course the missing musical legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and then into the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Swords.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such on-screen floors often make boys believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she felt that “something went wrong” and thought about how to handle the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of ?MeToo.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old co-star of Throne of Swords, has admitted to worrying a lot about this issue.
"Personally, I'm very concerned at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?" he said.
“What did we teach men as they grew up in terms of the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: ‘What is innate and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes kids think they have to be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time – how can we change things?
Because obviously something went wrong for young people.”
During the interview he also admitted that he will not perform any prequels or sequels to Throne of Spade once the series ends next summer, stating that he “has ended up with battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s True West revival, the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor has recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing that happened with Throne of Swords.
“I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this regard my future family, and my life from now on,” he explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow, the character of Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported as early as the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has shrunk to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country’s traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators’ data, and speaks of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
The U.S. Congresswoman on Saturday denounced accusations against a member of her staff about posting personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic congresswoman in Los Angeles said the statements were fomented by opinionators and websites of the "ultra-right wing".
"Lies, lies and still contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday, released by an anonymous from the Capitol during a hearing by a panel of experts on allegations of sexual violence against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released information related to a Waters staff member.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were jeopardized as a result of these false and biased allegations, was in no way responsible for the leaking of that information.
This unfounded accusation is utterly false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ claim quickly sparked online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious," Fleischer wrote.
“That means he doesn’t have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
It must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by detractors of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to oust Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Enormous if confirmed," he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters said its office alerted “competent authorities and law enforcement to these biased claims.
"We will make sure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their dangerous and harmful actions for all of my staff members."
Johnny English review strikes again - spy parody with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become customary to search for references to Brexit in every new film with a British twist and this seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, begun in 2003 and brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Rebirth.
Will the veiled self-iron on the subject of how grossly we do be the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and eyes out of orbit has obtained his license to mess things up for the second time – and his name indicates more than anything that it is a comical creation developed for the countries of non-English-speaking moviegoers.
Obviously he is the silly secret agent who despite his strange claims of glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind that contributed with a single note to the theme of moments of Glory at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man who once played Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, which left chaos behind.
There are one or two cool moments in this latest release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers swirl briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems quite under-sized and oddly superfluous, particularly now that “serial” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems aimed at children rather than adults and for me Johnny English’s crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson’s silent films when he plays Mr Bean.
The premise of immutable actuality now is that Britain is in serious danger.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent in charge, a role unfortunately very small for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that overflows the vase for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character similar to Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to recall someone who has already retired.
And this means that the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a school manager in a chic establishment, but who also teaches unofficial lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some cute gags, when English offers a School of Rock spying course.
English is beaten up in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former ailing partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a role as a high society girl in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of Disasters for Her Majesty’s Secret Service are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling into the network of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by smuggling themselves into Volta's luxury yacht and English creates pure anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality mask to gain familiarity with Volta's home interior.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the latest sequence, but no matter how graceful and exuberant, there’s a lot of children’s TV throughout the story.
The whole thing is pretty modest.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Couldn’t the British film industry assign Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan so that the British people can work four days a week but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, while being paid for five.
The party would like the top companies to transfer the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an extra day off.
In this way, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend while maintaining the same pay.
Some sources said the idea would be compatible with the party’s economic program and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day day was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “By the end of the year a revision of the political line is expected to be announced.”
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
At the moment, however, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not part of the party’s political line and is not currently under discussion.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless executives” and “speculators” in businesses for utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also imply that current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, as the Labour government could implement “deductions” based on behavior deemed illegal.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and create inclusive equity funds, transferring 10 percent of the net worth of private sector companies to employees, who end up pocketing annual dividends of up to ?500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, and raises questions about whether or not the government agency’s findings could influence some of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview to air Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to bring something to light that could cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said it while I was going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what had happened, that the accusation had come out, I said, ‘Did you do it?’
It was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems to be carved into the rock.
“I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could withstand a bomb-proof charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vigorously denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And whoever you nominate couldn’t prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that sees the performance of a remarkable roster of stars and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pouring into the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also an awareness about the real purpose of the event, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But, to be precise, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that there are 12 years left to achieve the goal set?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another example of so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel like they’re really making a difference by simply signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “shares” of its supporters, working for a variety of purposes.
It states that these actions have helped to urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, aimed at influencing the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that to date, protected capital funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and performers committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, an ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were implemented calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, he asked, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult journey – sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of those who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to implement 'blockade' and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can, “if necessary,” resort to its own navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russian involvement in Syria – particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate for energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern fulcrum of Europe,” he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the possibility, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not put on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit that calls itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
“The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “unversatile,” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, which for European consumers is by far the cheapest option.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of Nord Stream 2, an “inappropriate” pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the 11-billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to double the capacity of the pre-existing one to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, U.S. Energy Secretary.
The U.S. position triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s flagship industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of the European Union’s energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I see it as a big problem that a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take ‘serious consideration’ of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren on Saturday said she would "seriously consider" running for president following the midterm elections.
At a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and set up our ill-fated government, and that means having a woman at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
During the town assembly Warren said his about President Donald Trump, declaring that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction."
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, whom he appointed to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: “It is natural that there is a need for an FBI investigation before the vote.”
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters don’t think he should run in 2020.
58 percent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such a bid.
The poll found greater support for a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent opposing.
Other names of high-profile Democrats discussed about a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after he’s back, I can relate to other families who are experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun under drugs, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia Support the Challenge for New Asylum Policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are waging a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday presented an amicus curiae memoir in Washington to support an asylum seeker who contested that policy, as reported by NBC News.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Union for Civil Liberties filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and her violent gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate vast numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing rampant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed an asylum application to be filed with undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, District Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be judged on the basis of the particular circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates that principle,” said amicus curiae.
Prosecutors also objected that the policy banning immigrants from entering the country harms the U.S. economy, stating the clear likelihood that immigrants will become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is accessible to those who leave their country of origin due to persecution or fears due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11.
Asylum has never been designed to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly desperate.
“There’s a lot of tension,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her feverish little baby at an evacuation center in the destroyed town of Palu.
"At any time there is an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, scouring through their frivolous personal belongings in an attempt to retrieve whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a shoulder and back fracture, were resting outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to continuing heavy aftershocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he recounted the sensation of the violent earthquake shaking the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
“There was no time to save us.
“I was crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Making Bullying’ with ‘Advertising Propaganda’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper, advertising the mortgage benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press for propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's announcement in the Des Moines Register - the highest-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6, a charge that China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election highlighted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase of an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war that has seen them adjust their tariffs to their respective imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and US experts have stated.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, “now increases that bullying by posting advertising on our free newspapers.”
“In spreading its own propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of free speech and press, placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Conversely, in the street newsstand here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese people may have on China’s problematic economic trajectory, given that the media are under the firm fist of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most flagship newspapers has evaded the offer to publish” his article, although he did not state which newspaper it is.
Republicans are alienating the female electorate ahead of midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Given that many top Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court and stand by her side in dealing with various sexual harassment allegations, analysts have signalled that a negative reaction will be seen, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
“You can’t take these things back,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it either tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan “November is coming!” during their protest in the Senate hall, when Republicans who control the Judiciary Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
“Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation are skyrocketing,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
“People say they were already tall; it’s true.
But they could be higher, especially among the undecided electricians in the suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote despite not liking the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had speculated that a negative reaction could have occurred if Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"It's become a messy whole for the GOP," Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it’s also about the way Republicans handled the situation and the way they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told the news channel.
In any case, Americans seem to be somewhat divided between the person to believe in following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a smaller percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals during a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that derives its origins from Berners-Lee’s solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is “to dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available on a single browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online store of personal data is that it is completely up to the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, says John Bruce, the company’s CEO, is to bring the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, some developers on staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to bring their decentralized apps to life using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team won’t tell “Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely thrown away overnight.
“We are not asking for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to procure commercial energy and an ecosystem that contributes to protecting the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Church of England cleric to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
The lieutenant colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, won recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had obtained the highest level of British military honor.
Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, her two grandchildren inaugurated a commemorative plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “magnificently symbolic” that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and the war machines".
He then rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest gallantry" advanced the line before running with a single-handed cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never live up to and something that makes me humbler.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt really honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by so many people."
MMA fans stood up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to be denied the vision of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some remained grounded after staying awake until the early hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter, a fan described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad taste joke.”
"Government regulations provide that content was no longer appropriate at six in the morning, so we had to switch to children's programming," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Pip the pig," "yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said he will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution until Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages arrived and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We’ll limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally do – and we’ve tried to get so much for the fans, and we’ve just discussed it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ Due to Sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality – but this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize, until he got to high school, that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking in the first installment of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Laverne said she had made her voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that becoming a parent made it less important for him to win the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-time program, Kirsty Young, took a number of months off for illness.
Presenting himself as an outcast on Laverne’s first program, Daley said he felt “less than” anyone else growing up because “it wasn’t socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls.”
He said, “These days, the feeling of feeling less of, and feeling different, were the things that really gave me the strength and energy to be successful.”
He wanted to try to be “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they happened to find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at this year’s Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man – the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “surprised me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so many at a young age,” he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June to a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “whole perspective” has changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that I had to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are things that are more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be here so you can be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I hadn’t yet realized he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
“I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – swimming in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which had particular significance to him in preparation for the Olympics and still makes him come up with goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson put on the bench in Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to get back in shape to prevent it from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the two-year event for a record-breaking twelfth time, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it was often for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between doing cheerleading and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what tormented him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the uneven track regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the course itself isn’t daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth match, faces the accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of their 12 individual matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson’s match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much more.
“He fully understood the role he had today, he gave me a pat on the shoulder, put an arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It’s a Hall of Famer and it’s added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s the way it went and that’s the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never even remotely reflected the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, though Furyk said his presence brought intangible assets to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the meeting room,” he explained.
“I also think younger players had fun fighting against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He did a lot more than just play.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can vanish soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable race.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama where the team, led by Sve Ballesteros, despite a five-point detachment from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimal lead, winning 141-2-131-2.
“I keep repeating that we had a good lead at Valderrama, we had it at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but little,” Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday 5-3 and yesterday 10-6 at Le Golf National.
“So it will be the story that proves to me and my team that it’s not over.
Tomorrow we have to do our best.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It's not over until the dots are scored on the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who’s on the other side: the best golfers in the world.”
Happy with the way his team competed on that tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have surpassed myself.
Tomorrow’s is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the time for individual performances, which is another thing.
It’s nice to be there with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re just your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, you have to bring out the best of yourself.
Then you forget about your partner because he too has to go there and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, counterpart Jim Furyk will look to his players for the best individual performance rather than team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those big games of the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing against the European "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every single word,” he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start immediately with the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the game begins to take a certain turn, the pressure increases in the mid-games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way that we think is appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
“I chose this order because I think it covers the course to the end,” Bjorn said of his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany’s new military ship has been postponed again.
According to local media, the last frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the Cold War times, but there will be at least until next year due to faulty systems and a surge in costs.
The Rheinland-Pfalz commission, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying post-delivery issues tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic markings.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuing delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will already become obsolete when they enter service.
The ill-fated F-125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have noted a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that have rendered the ship useless if employed on a combat mission.
The shortcomings in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the older Bremen-class ships.
In addition, it turned out that the ship definitely weighs too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initials of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involving the new frigates become of particular importance in light of the recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the Navy actually “lacks any ships that can be employed.”
The official said the issue has worsened considerably over time, as the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
New research at a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal how bats use their eyesight to procure food.
He is confident that the findings can shed light on the behavior of the only existing flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and soprano, as well as brown ears and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using handheld detectors.
Analysis of recorded sounds by an expert will determine the frequency of bat recalls and how each species behaves.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed, scaled-up picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the findings can reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating lawns, and how to best maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
Bats are at risk due to construction and development work affecting trespoli and ruining habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can mosquito-killing paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to grabbing a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to spot insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect triplets, and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organization even established Scotland’s first bat-only reserve at the Threave estate in the Dumfries and Galloway region, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The estate’s manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory.
“Here at Threave we have a large area for bats,” he said.
“We have ancient buildings, many centuries-old trees and a good habitat.
But there’s a lot about bats we don’t know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs.”
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before conducting maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal threshing tree can kill up to 400 females and young, perhaps wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them, or destroy their trespasses.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don’t know what their populations are like.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges While Lawyers Sue German Weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to advertise” under his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the accusations.
The Portuguese Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also announced Friday the charge of paying $375,000 to keep quiet about what happened.
In a video on Instagram directed at his 142 million followers, in the hours following the accusations, Ronaldo, 33, chopped off the statements as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false,” says the five-time Ballon d’Or facing the camera.
“They want to get publicity through my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” added the footballer smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s attorneys are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, called “an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the private sphere.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for “moral damage to the extent corresponding to the severity of the privacy violation, considered, probably, one of the most serious personal rights in recent years.”
The event would take place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player’s room, where he subjected her to anal violence, according to statements filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo would get on his knees after the incident saying he was “99 percent” a “good guy” disappointed by the “one percent.”
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sex, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also says she went to the police and hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation deal because she felt "terrorized by retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "coming publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old is now trying to overturn the deal, claiming she was still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time, and this summer he will join Italian Juventus with a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
Britain “may regret forever” the loss of its status as a world leader in car construction following Brexit, said Industry Minister Greg Clark.
He also added that he was "concerned" by Toyota UK's statements to the BBC about Britain's possible exit from the EU without a deal and the resulting momentary shutdown of production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker says delays at borders, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, could affect jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced around 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s general manager in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers are increasingly concerned about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini facilities in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the supply chain risks faced by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on the basis of the “just in time” concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from British and European suppliers for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, border unrest could occur that would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark says Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid these border inconveniences.”
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us to not only enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop, but in the long run, it warns that additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the plant’s union delegates, says the workers are deeply concerned: “In my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reinstated.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred by a week,” as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the possible impediment to justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy justice minister, thus putting Mueller’s independence at risk, has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Over the course of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bed bug to record conversations with Trump and try to remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and rumored he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Wednesday with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh, further delaying the final Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set, it could be this week, I guess it will postpone another week considering everything that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press.”
Some reporters may dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders said the shortage of briefings was not due to an aversion to "exhibiting" television journalists, although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are exhibiting."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
“The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him,” he said, without citing evidence.
Briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
Let’s try to do it, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace the briefings with the press and you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have proved the reason for this, by giving a free-wheeling, and at the same time bizarre, speech to a group of journalists.
Health Minister writes to Scottish NHS European workers to express his concerns about Brexit
The Health Minister wrote to EU staff working at Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance of the UK’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meeting the costs of requests for settled status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: “Throughout the summer there have been continuous negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British government has also prepared for the eventuality of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we very much hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie was operated on as a result of a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after reporting a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost by 31 to 27, according to Mike Organ of The Tennessee newspaper.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He approached the field and fainted," Reed said.
First-aid workers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field, before putting it in the stretcher and taking it away for further investigation.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no news yet about the type and extent of the damage" and that the Tennessee State are trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving out of Illinois.
He had made a total of five tackles before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to new Labour plans.
The manoeuvre will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters
The stamp tax increase will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Department plans to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters with a promise to provide affordable housing and higher incomes.
The stamp tax increase will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional resources will be in support of the government’s initiative to combat the phenomenon of homelessness.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let properties, could amount to more than 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the manoeuvre to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many of the wealthiest areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the state.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson requested a stamp tax cut to help younger people buy their first home.
He accused big construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by taking land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain’s “real estate misfortune.”
MP Corbyn has announced an astonishing array of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and the elimination of unsuspecting evictions.
It also wants to give the council more powers on the construction of new properties.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year I said that I would be committed to re-establishing the British dream, namely that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if buying a home was equally easy for people who do not reside in the UK and for foreign companies, as it is for British workers residing.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.
Jack Ross: “My greatest aspiration is to lead Scotland”
Sunderland’s Technical Director Jack Ross says his “maximum aspiration” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old is drawn to the challenge of raising the Northeastern team that is currently third in League One, three points from the summit.
He landed at the Stadium of Light this summer after driving St. Mirren during last season’s Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I’ve been in Serie B and that’s all,” Ross told the BBC’s Sportsound.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it’s something I’ll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager.”
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn’t feel any anxiety about following such important names in an equally important team, having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town’s proposals.
“Success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back into the Premier League.”
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I think I’ll only succeed if I can get the team back on track.”
Ross's managerial career began three years ago, after a stint as assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a replacement coach for the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa save themselves from relegation to the third level and led St. Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his football career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real turning point,” he recalls about the direction of Alloa.
“I really believed that the role of manager was made for me, more than the role of player.
It seems strange because I worked well, earned a living and had some good results.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with weekly.
I still deal with them in terms of stress and work pressure but the management looks good.
I’ve always wanted to direct and now I do, I feel much more comfortable than I’ve ever been in my life.”

According to one study, the right time for a pint is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has brought more revenue to struggling British pubs and more concern to catering services.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
CGA’s Peter Martin put the data together and commented: “The persistence of the sun and England’s long stay at the World Cup meant that July followed a similar path to June, when pubs were above 2.8 percent, while restaurants were hit harder.
The 1.8 percent decline in catering in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which you mostly drink were the strongest, with a homogeneous increase above the decline of the restaurants.
Even the pubs where you eat have suffered from the heat, although not as excessively as the restaurateurs.
It seems like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and managed bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent a month, while food consumption fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreational and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent decline in sales per year will be particularly burdensome in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurants and only the weather can tell if the more moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary respite.
Global sales growth between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand roll-outs.
Sales tracking company Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes performance data across 47 operating groups, with combined sales of more than 9 billion pounds, and is the industry reference company.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, has secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Instagram” pages.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being posted.
20 percent of students say they have a “primary” account to show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates social media accounts that keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake Instagram” accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they run a cleaned “main” account to show parents, while keeping one private.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, from the UK’s Digital Awareness and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of private schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of these admitted to keeping accounts private.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'Voice for Athletes' on Board of Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected a non-executive member of the board of Scottish Athletics during the National General Assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys deep respect from the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that in Scotland athletics could gain a huge advantage by bringing it into the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope to be able to contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland.”
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently a BBC commentator, found herself unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job but I recovered completely, he learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
I thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
The advertising of a breast pump compares mothers and cows and divides the opinion online
A dairy company has shared opinion online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers and cows who are riding.
To mark the launch of what is called the “world’s first silent and wearable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an advertisement in the form of joking music video to show the freedom to express themselves as mothers given by the new breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, “Yes, I get milk but I don’t have one thing” and “If I hadn’t noticed, these aren’t breasts but my tits.”
The choir continues: “Take it out, take it out, feed the children, take it out, take it out, take the milk to my ladies.”
However, the advertisement, posted on the company’s Facebook pages, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked different reactions among viewers, many of whom claimed it highlighted the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s an unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce the milk, except that their little ones are stolen from them within a few days of birth.”
The Elvie breast pump is worn discreetly under a bra for moms
Someone else commented: “Comprehensibly traumatic for both the mother and the little one.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who will continue to hold their children?"
Someone else added, “It’s really meaningless advertising.”
Others defended her and one woman even admitted to finding the song "fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If you were still breastfeeding, I wish I had one.
When I used the milk pump, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irreverent, but it doesn’t get very far from reality.
This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a fun advertisement dedicated to mothers who use the breast pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like ‘cows.’”
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet breast pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvie breast pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be tucked into a breastfeeding bra giving women the freedom to move, hold children in their arms and even go out while pulling milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the women who use the milk puller to the cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk puller is able to ensure.”
This is not the first time Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children showed up on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to a tent town on Texas border
The number of migrant children has risen exponentially even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and political line of the Trump administration has made it more difficult for these children to take care of.
Most of those taking them into their care were usually illegal immigrants who are now afraid to jeopardize their chances of staying in the country by offering to do so.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential custodians and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had offered to take care of children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
Almost 80% of the people who offer to take care of children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we are continuing to hunt these people down,” Albence said.
To try to prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that some of them will have to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to those working at reception points.
Many will appear in videoconferencing instead of in person, to plead their case of legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unsuitable for help will be expelled quickly.
The longer children remain in care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or escape attempts, according to those who work at reception points and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Proponents of this position say that the likelihood of this occurring is even higher in a large facility like the one in Tornillo where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for children’s discomfort signs to be ignored.
They add that moving children to the tent without giving them time to prepare emotionally or greet friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home even though the war has now reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces illegally occupy Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately without any conditions," he said before the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where there have been more than 360,000 deaths since 2011 and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and support Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions were favorable for their return and accused “some Western countries” of “inciting unfounded fears” that push refugees away from their homeland.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return,” he said.
“What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that in Syria no aid will be allocated for reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has “precise deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, which will “be uprooted.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene a new committee of government and opposition members to roll out a draft constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the group’s work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” without any interference.
Why Trump will win the second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may hope, his presidency should end prematurely due to impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential final ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of the viewers flexing.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first night have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the early evening, up sharply from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” surpassed the network’s percentages by reaching 3.5 million viewers on the top news evenings.
“It’s a fire that people are attracted to because it’s not something explainable,” says Neal Baer, showrunner on ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a brilliant comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, “Because it makes me laugh.”
Chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television show, the plot of Washington’s events can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade ruling, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite or not, and the health status of the global economy.
Stopping to follow the news is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond its duty as informed citizens to follow for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s in-depth research for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skinned jacket (“a garment full of trash,” commented The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Trump’s disgusting descriptions.
For example, I won’t be able to watch Super Mario without thinking about it.
“Part of the reason what it does look like a reality show is that there’s something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars,” about the actors’ shift and the day-to-day plot developments of Trump’s show (in contrast to NFL praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t miss an episode, otherwise you’ll be left behind.
This week I went to see Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and despite it being a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in the house watching MSNBC and in the meantime recording CNN.
He failed to break away from TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented, “I remember when we were once doing all those absurd programs and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.’
“I thought it was a joke, but they were right.”

Influx of external money in the race for the tightest midterm elections
It is no surprise that in the 17th district there is an influx of money due to the realignment of a congressional district that has caused two incumbents to now run for the same seat.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburgh brings on the scene Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is racing against another incumbent member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania overlapping the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that in the old districts electoral colleges had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
The race to the 17th district sparked fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a measure victory in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That position had been held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought to penalize El Salvador because it supports China, then changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather cordial meeting took place between Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization’s leadership group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to bring the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the “recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the decision to impose sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the Americans for drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been worrying for the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and murderers.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold last year a similar meeting that was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September senior management officials made clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thereby definitively renouncing any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, demonstrating the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any further reprimands or punishments from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, anonymously, about the domestic decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who still wanted to remain anonymous.
Study the history
In the report, Special Counsel Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstructing justice, a fact that seems to have been proven by now.
According to reports, Mueller’s investigation intends to shed light on Trump’s possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress passes to Democrats, Trump should respond to these accusations before voters and perhaps a jury of his own just as he prepares for a new candidacy.
There are many unknowns and I do not mean to say that Trump’s downfall is inevitable, as is that of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
On that occasion we failed by missing the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now have to deal with different things.
What if Trump decides to fire deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s position has been complicated since this very paper reported that last year it secretly suggested that Trump be intercepted by questioning his ability to serve as president.
Rosenstein says the news in The Times is not true.
“How will we react if the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if he will be upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to answer for his actions?
If we don’t pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think that we will make it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such a legacy, I can only be optimistic about the future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the convincing tie against Villarreal in Spain, would give them excellent opportunities to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Although midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal due to a knee injury, he believes this result could allow the Rangers to do great things.
“For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We faced the game convinced we were doing well and we brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the tie is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not be able to disappoint.
Last year was certainly difficult because of my injuries and changes at the club level, but now the feeling is positive.
The team is in shape, the guys have fun and the preparation goes well.
So we can forget the problems of last season and think about the future.”
Women are worried about the cost of long-term care
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of care they would like to receive, few have addressed the issue in the family.
About half of Nationwide respondents say they have talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% say they have talked to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, Nationwide’s vice president of life insurance, “people want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t face this conversation.”
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children about it: you can’t prepare your family to attend if you don’t communicate in time what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determinant for the costs.
Involve a financial advisor: they can advise you on how to pay the expenses you will face.
Choosing long-term care financing can include a traditional insurance policy or a life-saving hybrid policy to cover these expenses or continue to pay insurance money as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all the necessary documents to avoid legal battles to your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can oversee medical care and make sure the professionals meet your wishes in case you were unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid in case you were unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: imagine that your elderly parent is rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just a matter of finances, but who are the doctors?” asks Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be prepared for any eventuality.”
Man shot several times with a compressed air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle while walking home after spending the evening outside.
The victim, a forty-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was struck in the chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "random action".
The victim did not see his assailant.
He's not in any danger of life, however, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died as a result of a very strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Communications have been disrupted and rescuers have been unable to obtain any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami struck the western Donggala area in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the so-called Pacific fire belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006 – A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charge
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested on the charge of assault.
According to a report Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she tore her hand phone.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his bond was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court Saturday and declared himself "definitely innocent".
Palin is facing three counts of first-degree offenses, including detention for up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree offense punishable by a day's detention and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing the reporting of the crime and possession of a gun while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome following his time in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after Friday’s earthquake struck Indonesia’s Sulawesi island.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications grids are not working and the death toll is set to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi which is located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the town of Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek extraordinary capital punishment for suspects in NYC terror attacks
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that killed eight people – a rare penalty that has never been committed since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented Home Depot van to plummet onto a bike path along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by siding with pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under the conditions for applying for the death penalty in the southern district of New York, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and also “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury issued 22 charges against Saipov that included eight counts of murder with association with a criminal, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “a real planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
The preliminary notification states that “Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused harm, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.”
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the southern district of New York prosecuted the last death penalty case.
The man, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and charged with passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police say that in front of the investigators he was proud of what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he decided to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As for the 22 counts, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and life sentence without any chance of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s group of defenders had previously pleaded with prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Must Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to "mobilize the popular army" during a Tory conference protest.
When a member of Theresa May’s party parliament suggested he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of Britain’s Independence Party said politicians must “feel the pressure” of eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would “already be out of Europe” if Farage were the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party have been underlined by Tory pro-Europeans who took part in a separate anti-Brexit protest in London.
The prime minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
The Allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and “chaos.”
At the start of Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should be entrusted to Farage.
“We would be out of Europe by now,” he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: “I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan.”
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country.”
Bone rejected views that public opinion would change since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in Europe is completely false.”
Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit advocate, also attended the procession and told reporters: “I simply tell the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it and does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who go around the streets in search of votes to allow us to be elected.
Let go of the Chequers Plan and start listening.”
In an incisive message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers can retain their place when they keep their promises.”
At the rally, Farage said politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they were going to betray the decision made with the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we won’t allow it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class feel the pressure that is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the popular army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, those in favor of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of activists have pushed Tory against Brexit flags after the group was formed this weekend.
The Labour party ridiculed conservatives over security concerns they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus plus deal, for frictionless borders and for borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that he could challenge Trump in 2020 has long been in the air.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a town assembly since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she intends to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington to settle the government and this implies that a woman holds the highest office.”
Arrested for murdering Sims LSU player
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 am on ETNews.
On Friday, he released a video of the murder asking for help identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims brought back a gunshot wound to the head that caused his death,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted he was at the scene of the crime holding a gun and hitting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
A nearly two-meter junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played 32 games, 10 of which started with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of comrade Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately apparent that the Mercedes team’s orders would heavily affect the race.
From pole, Bottas starts well leaving Hamilton to defend against Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stops first at the pits leaving Hamilton in the group's tail traffic, a move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes makes the stop the next lap returning to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtakes it after some turn-by-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tries to prevent its passage inside, risking to end up out after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first lap he is already seventh on his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for much of the race without stopping at the pits for the tyre changer and tries to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen conquering fourth place.
In the end, however, he has to make the pit stop at the 44th lap and in the remaining 8 laps he is not able to increase the pace and overcome Raikkonen, who arrives fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri worked very well all weekend and he was really kind to get me through.
The team has done an exceptional job in winning first and second place,” Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
In a rally Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence on not disclosing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “little, mean and lying.”
“What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, bad and lying,” he said.
“When there are obvious signs that the news is being released and the officials say, ‘Oh no, it wasn’t me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it...No, we didn’t,” she added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion is leaked from his office.
“I didn’t hide Professor Ford’s allegations, but I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did.”
But his denial is not credible to the president, who commented during Saturday night’s rally: “I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst example of body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of attempted sex crime by three women, the president has suggested that Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see meanness, meanness. They don't care who they hurt, who they have to pass over to regain power and control," the president said, according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday's defeat in the Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return race Saturday at Dundee.
The Giants immediately passed in front of two goals on shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team to a tie before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the front.
Francois Bouchard scored the tie for the Dundees before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men that Friday night in Belfast had come back and won the match with Dundee 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won their first three games.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the 3:35 minute on Kendall McFaull's assists, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assists.
In what was a pretty animated first half, Sullivan brought the home team back to the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt provided Cownie with the tie assist to the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer decreed the advantage for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team recompacted and Bouchard regained the tie after a 27:37 strategic minute manoeuvre.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that led the Dundees for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and decreed his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he dies to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off and put them on the safe side.
More than 800 people have died and many have been missing as a result of a very strong earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save his life, twenty-one-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of Palu’s Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, which wobbled fearfully.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This is really sad news for us,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of casualties could reach thousands, and the national disaster countermeasures agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is set to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many others," said Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything it can to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related activities.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
During the year, Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air Niugini now claims there is a missing man after the lagoon accident
The airline of the flight that fell in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to escape, now claims that there is a missing person.
According to Air Niugini news, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were able to rescue the other passengers and crew after the crash while the plane was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline says six passengers were admitted to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy allege that the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses say the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very low altitude.
“And it was really a fortune,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water coming to life, managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he was hit slightly in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to fix up a pier have provided relief using a rubber dinghy to transport people to the shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in plane crashes of airlines registered with PNG but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the burnt woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution’s evidence came to an end in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cellphone data to reconstruct the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have retrieved location data from several cellphones showing that, contrary to what she said, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked if Tellis was telling the truth by saying he was in the Sanford truck that night, the latter confirmed that he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone data indicates they’ve only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
“He erased her from her life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its concluding argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the judgement to pass to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What is Mindful Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting positive messages in their songs.
Bristol-based group The High Breed says hip-hop has drifted away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to their origins and make a kind of hip-hop conscious again.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York City nanny sues a couple for firing her with a “racist” text
In New York, a nanny sued a couple for dismissing her in a discriminatory manner after accidentally receiving a text in which her mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple denies being racist by comparing the request to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who arrived for her first day at work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER NERA," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "embarrassed" dismissed Miss Maurice saying she was unhappy with their previous nanny, an African-American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
He paid Miss Maurice for her day's work and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice sued the couple and, for being fired, seeks compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work she was initially hired for, albeit without a contract.
“I want them to understand that they can’t behave like that,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by saying that the dismissal of Maurice was the only thing to do because they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent her a message saying something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
Would you entrust your children to a person with whom you have been rude, even if by mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real “extortion”, Plasco said that his wife has been giving birth for just two months and is in a “very difficult situation”.
“You can’t mess with a person like that.
It’s not very kind behavior,” the financial adviser added.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, the public opinion court immediately denounced spouses on social media, harshly criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A letter reveals that the editor of Paddington feared that readers would not like a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, comments: “It’s not easy to put yourself in the shoes of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s fun now that we know Paddington’s great success.”
Claiming that his father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a toy bear, would not react well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, who she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she adds that her father was modestly proud of his success.
“He was a pretty quiet man, not a presumptuous person,” she says.
“But Paddington was so real to him that he acted like when you have a son who reaches a goal: you’re proud of it even if it’s not your credit.
I think he interpreted Paddington’s success this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the credit to Paddington himself.
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my daughter who was dying.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter would not make it,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then she called me to tell me that she was going to die in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the drugs the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly fading.
She died a while ago and it was the end.
I had to sit and wait knowing this was happening.
I couldn’t complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back.”
Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
“Nobody knew,” he says.
“All the time I’ve been crying with my head down.
It’s hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Two Women Pained to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide commit to preventing others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she says.
Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said it lit up every room he went into.”
But before he died, he quit his job because depression had taken him “to a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there's a chain effect."
He created the tickets “to let people know that there’s someone they can turn to to talk to, even if it’s a friend.
They don’t have to be alone, they have to talk.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother’s death.
“You never said he felt down or depressed,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
Christmas day hit the bottom. When the children opened the presents, he avoided looking them in the eyes."
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to process: “He tore the family apart.
He tore us apart.
But we had to go forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain: FBI begins investigation
“I think that if we could proceed as he requested, that is, with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “losing calm” because of the blockade of rooted supporters.
Why doesn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
Only five weeks away from the midterm elections on November 6th, if the Republicans as expected get a negative result, they will be heavily weakened in their attempt to elect the man they chose to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators by pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes its report?
It will vote in the Senate, which is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear if Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the delays and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of political refugees ‘decreases’ with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge from South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, says that 1,127 refugees last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are a tighter control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs demanded by those who illegally leave these people.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal emigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to talk about the denuclearization negotiations that are in a stalemate.
This follows the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work together to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday criticized U.S. sanctions for lack of development since then.
“Without trust in the United States we cannot be sure of our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit for the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is characterly unfit to hold that office.
Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I think if a woman had behaved the same way, they would have called her hysterical,” Pelosi said of Kavanaugh’s statement Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Visibly emotionally Kavanaugh denied the accusation of sexually molesting Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was so emotional that he was almost screaming and his throat was tightened by tears as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned committee Democrats who called the accusations against him an “absurd and coordinated defamatory campaign” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves he can’t enter the Supreme Court because he has proven to be biased against Democrats.
“I think he self-excluded himself with his statements and the way he talked about the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if she would try to indict Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if Democrats would reach a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I think if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not only not suitable for the Supreme Court, but not for the court that chairs it now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh evaded questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said: “You cannot send a hysterical and biased person to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be welcomed in a positive way.”
And women have to use it.
It’s a fair fight, months and years of angry attacks from which he can’t get out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And he went on, "It really helped me a woman who was a manager somewhere. She told me that she was crying when she got angry, but she had developed a technique so that when she got angry and started crying she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then it continued.
I thought his was a brilliant idea.”
Tears are tolerated as vents of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office goes back to when I once started crying out of a fit of anger. An older woman, a glacial manager I had always been slightly terrified of, took me to the colloquium and dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let yourself be seen crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they’re holding you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his run for president.
In 1987, when on a boat called Monkey Business Hart's extramarital relationship was discovered and she had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she shouldn't try to run for president.
“It wasn’t actually a well-thought-out decision,” he said, laughing at us 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and there was definitely no need for another one.
Some called him "Biancaneve and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with fundraising and vowed that she would not run if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost cause in the beginning.
She found that some of the supporters who had given the candidates $1,000 would give her only $250.
“Do they think I can get a discount?” he asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, disappointment with the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger at the sexual discrimination she was a victim of), that she was moved.
“It looked like you were in the grip of a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled, thinking about the reaction from the press.
“Somebody might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
Maybe you're planning a lot."
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Favor Beijing
The opening shots of the U.S.-China trade war have been fierce, and while the battle is far from over, experts say a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, has already issued the first warning this year taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new duties on items worth over 200 billion dollars (175 billion euros). This means that taxes will be applied on half of the goods of Chinese origin.
Beijing has reacted every time with similar measures recently applying five to ten percent tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. one-on-one, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon back down.
For Washington to give up, it would have to give in to his demands, but bowing publicly to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US can positively affect China in the long run by diminishing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick policy decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions for an economic collapse in both countries is in fact far more dangerous than has been recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation in the territory is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million still living in Syria are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any conditional aid from those countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the 2018 Ryder Cup beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water at the sixteenth hole of par 3 granting victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his rounds becoming one of the four players of all time to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was first played in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with a score of 5&4 by the lower-ranked Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, gave up for 2&1 to the English Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia, who played eight, became the European player who won the most in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so glad I regained the cup.
It’s a win for the team and I’m happy to have made my contribution,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the witness to his compatriot John Ram who beat USA golf legend Tiger Woods with a score of 2&1 in the singulars on Sunday.
“If I think I grew up watching his matches, I’m really proud to have beaten Tiger Woods,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now the count of his Ryder Cup games amounts to 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think that he is one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team has been trying all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: “I’m proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europe team.
We threw this opportunity away.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've put it all together.
They played better than us.”
Red tide update: concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in the concentration of red tide in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patchy flowering conditions, suggesting a decrease in concentration, are evident in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
The red tide bloom stretches for about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The patches are about 10 miles off Hillsborough County but in fewer areas than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week an average concentration was reported in Pinellas County or off its coasts, a low-high concentration off Hillsborough County, from a low-high concentration to a high concentration in Manatee County, from a low-high concentration to a high-high concentration in Sarasota County or off its coasts, from a low-high concentration to a high-high concentration in the county.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Last week, there were no reports of any cases in Northwest Florida.
