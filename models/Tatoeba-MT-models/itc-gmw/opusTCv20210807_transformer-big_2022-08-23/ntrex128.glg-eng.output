Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned "to be taken as monikers"
Dismay among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to in English as AM, over the suggestion that they should change their name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate arose out of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the assembly across the country fear being ridiculed.
One Labour Party member said his group was concerned that the new name "remains with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "fool" and "pwp" means "poop".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed strong support for the name of the Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the AM title issue, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received most support in a public consultation.
The AM seems to be suggesting alternatives, but the fight to reach consensus could turn out to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules for disabling the AMs and the design of the committee system.
The MPs will get the final vote on what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim of its territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer at the price that has to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin remain silent as the churches of Harlem continue to fight
“The elders I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“Nowadays, neither one thing nor the other.”
He said he could see the bars were gone.
“People are socializing in other ways,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms in the neighborhoods that people go to regularly.”
Concerning the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and “sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the kind of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments from these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street tents, a shopping street in Harlem that was reluctant to hire and raise black people.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building, but as Johnson's customers made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Johnson's father and his successor in St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it for the largest carillon of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who have occupied St. Martin in recent months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish and which is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "pretends to pass on the costs" to the board, although the latter had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors that sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a boy while fishing for lobsters in California
Police said a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while fishing for lobsters in California on the first day of the crustacean's season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help, at which point he swam with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just excitement for catching a lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming, "I've been caught!
They've got me!'
He had his collarbone snapped." Hammel said he noticed when he arrived to see the boy.
“I berated everyone who came out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The first responder, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that they had spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the upper torso.
Officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to start an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to those in large warehouses full of expert helpers.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK beauty market, which amounts to 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow as sales in fashion and household products fall, the largest beauty runners will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and then move on to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those that can be seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of makeup Boutique so that most products are vegan-friendly, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume store, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores; the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the establishments will increasingly resemble shopping malls as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat outlets in hundreds of stores, as it bought the two chains two years ago. Apparently, this strengthened grocery sales and made acquisitions profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute pharmacy revenues in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds was said to be participating in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the image of our beauty runners to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel who you can turn to for advice.
Our range of products is designed to fit all needs and attractive and practical locations mean we are now a cosmetic destination that defies old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby retires from 11-million-pound business
“Dragons Den” star Peter Jones left “furious” after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11-million-pound business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for his Truly household clothes and accessories brand.
His company was compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones sparking by withdrawing from his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate Jones was "furious" when the golden TV girl admitted during a tense meeting held Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant she no longer had time to devote to the household clothing and accessories brand of both, Truly.
The business was even compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and was forecast to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, turned to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It will be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved in the project astonished.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow’s offices ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the abandonment of the presenter of This Morning is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and textiles to the home, and that it could delay its launch even further.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were vacationing together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host on ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we should not comment on his business affairs."
A complicated conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked with the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "little of a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said putting his voice as a “telecaster.”
“I didn’t give anything away.”
He noted that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three pesos after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at Saturday's United Nations General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Things are going well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free the hostages, and bringing home the remaining U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about his relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheater, we would have about 200 people standing around here,” Trump said.
Earthquake and Tsunami Devastate Indonesian Island, Killing Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international assistance, so it is a challenge," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly endures, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been built in Aceh, it is not common to find them on other shores.
Although an alert had been issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between many of Indonesia’s islands poses a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was deployed in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia's deteriorated infrastructure, and wasted money on roads and railroads.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is plagued by a severe lack of funding in the final straight to next year’s re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative way of living the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes because of street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores tie goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a 89th minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still being about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He played the ball with his left leg before shooting the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced to the upper left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga jumping into the air and entering the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position, to organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I came close to Kante and gave it a touch without thinking too much and I just shot.”
Chelsea won 1-0 on the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues frontman passed the heelball to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning near the mid-change and running into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful in-depth pass leading Hazard into the area.
Hazard outstripped the defense and ended up in the second pole scoring with a left-handed shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool face Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday afternoon at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the national disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that came down with the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and that caused waves of up to 6 meters, a spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Killed in Massacre
An assassination investigation was opened after the body of a woman in Birkenhead, Merseyside, was found this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gunshot wounds on John Street, and was arrested by a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked people in the area to see or hear something from it one step further.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make an appeal for anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us who has seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the dashboard camera that you can get in touch with us, as they could have key information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed the body belonged to a neighbor in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she found herself that morning.
The investigation continues as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but police have told him that they do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just learned that they won’t be able to re-enter within a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There was a woman on the scene crying.
He keeps saying, “It’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon watching the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to the MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing the September 30 registration 247.
Cromwell's statue of parliament becomes the last monument to be affected by the struggle to "rewrite history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects from England carried out by his fanatical and puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "shoot" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed Cromwell wrongly for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th-century opinion, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider still worthy of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more so in the late nineteenth century than now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was about monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
A Pig Killer Kills a Chinese Farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by his nickname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered in blood near a courtyard in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to put the vaccines to pigs in a courtyard on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin on Wednesdays from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to another adjacent court.
He said there was a large male with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing almost 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he killed him.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and crushed," his cousin, nicknamed "Wu," told the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police were gathering evidence on stage.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans previously.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 300 kilograms held a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don't tend to be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "trigger".
“They’re just playing.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they're not meant to hurt.
You just have to have the necessary respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy, generalized rainfall to the southwestern United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it flies over the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometres from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to advance north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a valley begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the U.S. East Coast. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical moisture northward, which will penetrate the southwestern U.S.A.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction of tropical humidity with the valvale will create abundant and generalized rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rainfall of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and the possibility of desert landslides.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will approach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise against venturing into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally splattered winds and dust.
The valley will bring strong local rainfall to parts of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause minor debris and sparse roads to flow.
These would be the first rains of the wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain spreads late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature swings in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the US.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm beginning of October is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures to the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the trial of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate testimonies of Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual schedule for a Friday breaking news: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is 100 percent sure Kavanaugh played them to him while he was drunk and that he tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimonial, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen him.
The company counted the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people who watch TV from offices.
To get an idea, it is an audience similar to that of a football final or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day trial, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure on television on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being tapped by protesters as he tried to enter an elevator on the way to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stared low for several minutes while being reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They said, "You have power while there are many helpless women."
Flake said his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator was closed, adding that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable broadcasts were broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination before the full Senate to be put to the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated allegations against the nominee the following week, urging a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of “playing politics” with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May’s so-called Brexit Chequers plan by saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the other party’s tariffs was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Killed: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police arrested a suspect in the shootings that ended the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge.
Officials broadcast the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the stage and claimed they contained Simpson's DNA, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to being the author of the shooting that killed Wayde.
The defense said he was bailed out of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana state police fugitive unit, the state police forensics lab, Southern University police and neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "dueness and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The late 2.01 grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade declared that the team was "knocked down" and "shocked" by Wayde's passing.
“This is what worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano overflows over Mexico City
The ashes thrown by the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several rumbles and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray on the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Catalan police and separatists clash ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia’s secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists contained by riot police swirled eggs and powdered paint that created clouds of dark dust on the streets that used to be crowded with tourists.
There were also refreshments later that day with the police, who used the batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups who chanted “Neither forget nor forgive” clashed with unionist protesters who shouted “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received in the protest, according to local media.
The tension continues to blossom in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although voter turnout was low and opponents of secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped out all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place the same way, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the pro-independence demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hopes of Catalonia achieving independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a narrow, albeit decisive, victory in the regional elections last December, this year pro-independence Catalan parties struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of police with his cellphone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pretrial detention since last year, announced that the following year he would stand for election to the European Parliament.
“Presenting myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we suffer from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry arrests man after car hits house
Three 33-, 34- and 39-year-old men were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry house on several occasions.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
Police investigator Bob Blemmings declared the mesh and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It’s also possible that you’ll be shooting at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The rising Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as head coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise to a level after the Hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, from which they separate eight points.
But soon the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remain undefeated in the division for a sixth straight game; head coach Holt hasn't seen the loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last season.
Livingston misses opportunities in the face of weakened visitors
Holt's team must have gone far ahead of the time they scored, as with their control they caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but his crossfire did not cross the threshold of the goal; then, Alan Lithgow's shot came off driven by a Craig Halkett header from the other side of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger visitors in standing ball play.
That’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers awarded a free throw and Livingston made a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to secure Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession but ran into an impenetrable defense that spared Liam Kelly a lot of work.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop for Kelly.
Rangers guard Allan McGregor stopped a shot from Scott Pittman, and Lithgow threw the ball out on another stop ball from Livingston.
Many crossing passes in the Livingston area were continually cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one by hand and one by Halkett's entry to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Phenomenal' by Livingston: review
Alasdair Lamont to BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
And unanimously, they were excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their upward trajectory.
His playing style and players have hardly changed since he returned to the top category, but some of the merit is Holt's in the way he has pushed the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, led a perfectly organized defense while Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall no break throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well at times under Gerrard's orders, this time they did not reach that level.
The last pass failed. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. A whole wake-up call for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the latest day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to fix relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city has the largest population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters came to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Deptford traffic accident: A cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died in a collision in which a car was wrapped in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a run-off on Childers Street just over a mile from Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in the high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. (summer time in Britain) on Sunday and continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, in which eight inmates are involved who are contained in a pavilion.
Officers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "He has despised prison personnel specially trained to deal with a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between grids.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was learned that the director of the prison center had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials had to go to jail to calm a riot in which staff were assaulted with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash floods (drought-affected areas could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is very likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa traverses the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday in rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that only ten tropical cyclones had maintained a state of depression or tropical storm within a 320-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread within a radius of 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Weather Service forecast 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 on Arizona's Mogollón Board.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocks and the Great Basin could reach 25 or 50 liters, with totals of 100 l/m2 being possible.
For those out of danger of flash floods, the Rosa rain could be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-largest category,” weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on Mexico’s Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which will still have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is encountering cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or night.
It could rain very heavily in some parts of Mexico, posing a significant flood risk.
"Total precipitations of between 75 and 150 l/m2 are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and it is possible to find up to 250 l/m2," reports weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then continue to climb through Arizona and enter southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what's left of it is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause sudden water trumpets and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Assault: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and found a 16-year-old boy with white gunshot wounds.
The teenager was found injured on Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace on Saturday around 04:00 (summer time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains “stable.”
Somerset police said three 17-, 18- and 20-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area during the night.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the mobile of the event.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘suffered the meanness and anger’ of Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the merciless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified in court on his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans" witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and bravery.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best lawyers of our time with a record of unpolluted public service,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
“It’s five weeks away from some of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t do it, but I do,” he said.
“That’s why I go everywhere fighting for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats’ mission is to “oppose and hinder.”
The first Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican assistant told CNN.
Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami kills hundreds and numbers continue to rise
Authorities said Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them swept away by giant waves that broke on beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke ground to the luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“Yesterday, when the threat emerged, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were dead,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB at a prey round in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, house, it wiped out everything it found,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled offshore at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many shops and buildings destroyed, bridges twisted and toppled, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the massive Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, set at the end of a long, narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantitative" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala and which is closer to the epicentre of the quake.
Communications were "totally paralyzed and there is no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, you can hear a man standing on the top floor of a building frantically screaming warning of the arrival of a tsunami to people on the street.
In a matter of minutes the water crashes into the beam carrying ahead buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that caused communications to be cut across Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Authorities say the army has already begun shipping cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees are still in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has been reopened but only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia’s tsunami death toll exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
On the way to Palu, where employees are rescuing in canvas shelters in his office yard, World Vision staff watched scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even as the groups began the nasty task of ending assistance in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing foreign aid workers with great knowledge and experience from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As long as the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can open ourselves up to international aid, but that time has not yet come."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, family and friends of the missing clung to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that lightened the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was taken out of a cave.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandon, head coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional load,” he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread among the paragliding community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were taking part in the beach festival.
However, only one gray mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he added.
$26,750 stolen while charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker reloading a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
In the press release, investigating officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had dumped a cashier in the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's clerk" and stole him a bag of money that he had to hand over.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects leave the stage, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about their identities, contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Or to be formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been known by the nickname Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
It will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her attendance for "emotional reasons," according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said that same year while talking about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
I went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye alone, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is another of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he preferred to call it Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also got tired of putting on and removing the script and using the capital letters.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians again as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students approaches.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in the square of Tlatelolco that "he would not use the military again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing some 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving boys to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in AI.
According to AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, a former employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lacked a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China was presenting its plan the previous year: it aims to be the number 1 in innovation in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are far behind the U.S., and we’re looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubting funding could double the odds that the next AI achievement would be in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is managing director of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-scoring American Othello player and was later executive at Microsoft Research of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology competitions as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government scholarships, Lee says.
“China is not the one taking the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired college geniuses to work in AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think they should offer residency cards to AI doctors,” he said.
The State Council of China published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Center that is meant to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not registered movement for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum if they change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday if they wished to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece and block applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim of its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum’s ballot was: “Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, allege that it is a price worth paying to gain admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would abide by the outcome of the vote and would make it final.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of parliament.
The state election commission stated that at 1 p.m. no irregularity was recorded.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko tabled their vote for the Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country that would pave the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the assembled tents for those who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads up and not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership," Zaev said after his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be “confirming our future.”
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the required.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people surveyed planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May.
Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses the entire defence of Brighton and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took charge of Brighton's 2-0 defence of Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the 65th minute goal.
The Argentinian frontman received a pass in the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before heading to the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green sweaters.
He disbanded a defense before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English frontman used the first touch area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton's wardrobe Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some problems on foot," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“I’m going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky to have scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the celebrities the first lead in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depth of the Brighton field in that play.
He sent a beautiful hole pass on the right side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite post.
The celestial blues put the ball in the goal before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Joker wants to party with the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the fight for the playoffs, there weren't many reasons to force another title.
But an always-competitive Scherzer hopes to throw Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications in the playoffs for the Rockies, who lead the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the national league.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard position with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but continue to try to close their first division title.
“Although we didn’t play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would be to play probably at the highest level I played this year.
“Why don’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the starter on Sunday, but they are apparently inclined to let Scherzer be what he throws at a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his 34th start, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will likely release Sunday on his usual day off.
Washington's right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the outcome in the midterm elections.
“We did everything we did in November.
It’s five weeks away from some of the most important elections of our lives.
This is something big, big... I don’t do it, but I really do do it and that’s why I’m going everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what’s happening now.
And they are determined to regain power using any necessary means, wickedness, and meanness.
“They don’t care who they do harm, who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control and we’re never going to give it to them.”
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder.”
“And they’ve seen that for the past four days,” he said, calling Democrats “swallowed, scorched, nasty and liars.”
He enumerated the Senate Judiciary Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong public wings.
“Remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm..exem, what?
No, no, no, wait... It was the worst body language, the worst I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer open.
They are not tolerant of those who express their opinion.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, the truth is, I wasn’t too surprised.
After all, they are the latest in a series of Labour Members who are not well received, and all to say our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she faced anti-Semitism decisively.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, coincidentally issues Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, the committee meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, that’s no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a “more kind and gentle” policy has long since been forgotten, if ever begun.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and it is judged whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader of the party, when comrades with whom he thought shared a similar political vision began to expect me to be portrayed and take positions he would never agree to, either on national security matters or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly, and in reality, whatever I say, there is a tremendous uproar and attacks on social media censoring center politics, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
It doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how insult levels were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every movement of “non-trust” or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in sight.
During the last few years I have received many advices that urge me to keep my head down, not to be so frank and that then "everything would be fine for me".
I didn’t get into politics to do that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago while still in school, driven by the neglect of Thatcher’s government that had literally dropped my class, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councilor and a government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be mistaken for my political stances and that I disagree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who promoted Friday’s motion, the only thing I would tell you is that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don’t understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting in what I consider to be in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie as MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr takes the lead
The last two attempts may have altered the final result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this mild tenent Premier League game.
Now they lead the table and are the only unbeaten team of the ten.
Ultimately it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, led the team to victory. And coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“So far we have been tested in our game and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said, "You have to admit that Ayr took advantage of the opportunities better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute rehearsal, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned to the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to get the numbers out and Jason Baggot set a wrong pitch.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle, he turned a shot into a solo, leaving the 17-5 mark in favor of Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a protracted stopover by the severe injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field in pandiola and, since restarting, Ayr advanced further through a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with an unused Bruce Colvine rehearsal, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for scoring Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored a rehearsal from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he almost did since the reboot, after Kyle Rowe had picked up the pitch in the David Armstrong area and sent him to third row Gregor Henry to get the local team's fifth rehearsal.
The protagonist of Still Game begins a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be poised to enter the restaurant industry after being found to have been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final one, and it seems that Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a source at Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': Bolivia inland hopes the court will make its way to the Pacific
The sailors watched a naval headquarters covered with aircraft in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are drowned in the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
Retrieving it is a duty.”
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a lost coast to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains alive, as does the longing to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes are perhaps at their peak in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX ruling on gigantic screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate Bolivia’s concession of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give a reason to Bolivia, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the CIX ruling comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicate that the case "was not complicated", says Chilean international law expert Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have been delayed.
"The issue of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill he had in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep up after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken an unusually quick decision.
Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile", and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, had been using this issue for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he said.
“The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can rely on the U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong said his nation would not proceed with nuclear disarmament if Washington could not be trusted.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting stagnant nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s “a utopia” that the continued U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War will double down on the North.
In Washington they resist accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely cover yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the catwalk a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that embraced the audience with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers brought their most amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide flap imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large-sized accessories were enraged watermelons, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the haute couture.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving gear, with the glasses and the tube, and others like a molten ice cone.
And if you're a huge fashion fan, you're in luck.
Fashionistas predicted that giant hats could reach the tents.
The disproportionate hats come just after the "Bomb", the straw hat with a 60-centimeter flap that takes everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought to the catwalk another great creation: a straw beach bag almost as big as the model dressed in a bathing suit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ La Riviera Spring Summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope that the big hats and beach bags will hit the stores next summer, as the designer had such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Private schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, that strikes him.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he will come to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest pass rates in private schools.
68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved an outstanding achievement.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained honorary enrolment in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding.
This demonstrates that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages are taking the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in private and all kinds of school programs.
A 2014 UK Employment and Training Commission survey found that a lack of language skills accounted for 17% of the reasons why employers struggle to fill vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifetime skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those in developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the languages of instruction differ by school.
Some schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others opt for languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of their children, private schools always have several languages to choose from and teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and staff with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
We cannot deny that at this time, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It has to be done.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Board of Private Schools.
Lebron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Team coach Like Walton has announced that James will play the opening match of the preseason against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready,” he said.
Trump's Elections Arrive in Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in closely related cities such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote paused for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, given that Republicans risk losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia and how can you view it on the internet?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address the issue of this week’s trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct and who is holding the Senate confirmation vote on hold for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November election with fresh momentum.
Therefore, these five rallies that Trump will hold next week are aimed at “dynamicizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible ahead of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage of Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate nominee Patrick Morrisey, the latest in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday’s individual matches
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging impulse pendulum is a totally invented sporting concept but in what athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so I guess we take that as a bit of momentum," Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a bit of wind in their favor and a lot to cheer for, among other things the Spieth and Justin Thomas technique, which they played together all day and each has three four-pointers.
Spieth has proved lethal from tee to green and is preaching by example.
Those guttural screams became stronger as his round progressed, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
By getting the putt that made them win the match in the 15th, he threw a similar scream, the kind of scream that he says he believes the American team is not yet out.
“You just have to focus and worry about your game,” Spieth said.
It’s the only thing that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple has four of four and they can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a fool of themselves on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That route, and the way its energy seems to flow to the crowd and from it, confirms them as rivals beat Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to get a win when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio García, the hero of tomorrow's fourballs, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first course ended up with the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely for the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the ones they don’t, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and they have a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA has the stamina to fight, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has a 10-6 advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup after exiting the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods struggling to climb four points to the scoreboard at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but failed to cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four starting games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they fitted in perfectly to defeat a ragged Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without pain or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning fourballs, reunited with his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes addressing a loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant breeze day in southwest Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2&1 win over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned to Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There have only been two times in Ryder Cup history in which a team went up four points in the individual, although as the current trophy holder, Furyk's team only needs to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea Says No to Unilateral Disarmament
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increased its distrust of the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps to show its goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test fields and committing to the proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see the corresponding response from the US,” he added.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament on our part first.”
While Ri resumed North Korea's already well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to "gradual" denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had done with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean peninsula while Trump secured North Korea's security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that first Pyongyang must lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its coercive goal, and even opposes the 'declaration of an end to war,'" Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the American leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the “evil president” Trump called Kim “home rocket on a suicide mission.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work remains to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for that, and that “it takes two years, three or five months anyway.”
China and Russia are discussing whether the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: “Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe full, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, just hours after North Korea denounced him for making "mafioso demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and progress toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new course from Harvard University is making all of its students sleep longer in order to combat the growth of caffeine-stimulated sexist culture from studying all night long.
One academic has discovered that students at the world’s number one university often don’t know the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why do you only tell me this now, in my senior year?’
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basics about how acquiring good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had a major lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how a lack of prolonged sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We don't know that the behavior of the students will change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know this information, just as we have a right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in spending all night awake still exists, he says. And he adds that modern technology and the growing pressure for students that implied lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep and have good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he points out. Even avoiding getting fat, since lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which constantly makes it hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course throughout the campus.
The next step, wait, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to lie down, as well as when they wake up. Likewise, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's team intended to score their first home win since winning 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team resulted in Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as coach, which left his team eight points from the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before break and an under-inspired Rangers lineup never gave the feeling that he was going to tie.
While the Rangers descended to sixth, Livingston climbed to third place and is only behind Hibernian with a goal difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to deal with a head injury after allegedly throwing an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that tore Ayr apart in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livingston 11 who drew a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organized ensemble choked his opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when the short run of Menga's first half sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free throw from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him in the second leg.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Undoubtedly, Alfredo Morelos felt they would have to hit the penalty in the 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only made two shots to the goal in the first half, but Ibrox's former warden, Liam Kelly, barely had problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of the Livingston in the 34th minute could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers failed again in the face of Jacobs' strong lineup.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his cool blood to choose Menga for a single finish.
Gerrard acted in the break by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, which almost had an immediate effect when the left-hander made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead in the final moments, but McGregor rose perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty when he got entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson regained his sight.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTADO... was the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science since then, the accountant Geiger has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
“What is this in the world?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headsets, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "Say, I'm sure it's popping right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” defective cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the defective cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer and inject it again
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting patients' immune cells and "signaling" them to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
The result was not good.
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was impressed in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a make America Great Again cap, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white man and say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
If I had been concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault lawsuits.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded the images of West's critics to social media.
It’s not clear if Rock was trying to mock West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They came with me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I was intimidated!
And then they said I was on my way," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see how I'm going to piss off?", saying that he would "wear my superman cap, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do."
Try it with love.”
His comments provoked cockles in the audience at least twice and SNL cast members seemed to be embarrassed, he told Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave to the publication: "The whole study was completely silent."
They had named West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many bewildered with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West got the support of conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FRONTING THE MAFIA"
However, the host of an interview show, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "being who he is and that's completely wonderful."
“So I chose NOT to reward anyone (buying their music or clothes or supporting their ‘art’) who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
It's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the one officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the song, Prince, changed its name to a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempt to stab homicide charges at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an east Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of Magistrates on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-handling role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the sexist hero stereotype, saying such on-screen roles translate into it that it seems young people often have to be tough to respect them.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has failed" and wondered how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of ?MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that she feels "quite strong" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. What are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not do any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "enough of horses and battlefields".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes his encounter with his wife, Rose, was the best in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so in a way, it provided me with my future family and my life from now on,” she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the family-heritage land of Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health officials said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they say discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff leaked GOP senators’ data, “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three U.S. Republican Party senators on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators from the “ultra-right.”
"Lies, lies and more infamous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, the U.S. government headquarters, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters department and disclosed the information of a Waters staffer, Capitol Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is utterly false and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, has not been responsible in any way for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded accusation is utterly false and a complete lie.”
Waters' statement prompted criticism online, including that of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial was done with anger," Fleischer wrote.
“He doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
You don’t have to be challenging.
You must not question the accuser’s motives.
You have to stay calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, which critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican nominee who ran to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s hard to believe,” he shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department alerted "law enforcement agencies and appropriate authorities to these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that we uncover the culprits as well as that they hold themselves legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team.”
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Back in Action), Rowan Atkinson's powerless spy parody
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and action comedy of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire turn on the matter of the evidently stupid we are in the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English's incompetent jump-eyed, rubber-faced character has renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comic creation designed for non-English-speaking movie territories.
Naturally, it's the silly secret agent who, despite his quirky claims of flattering glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a bit of that guy who contributed a single note on the theme of Cars of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's now-forgotten television commercials, which spawned chaos in his wake.
There are a couple of good moments in Johnny English's last departure.
I love when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval suit of armor and the steps of the rotor make a brief bang against its hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy comes to mind, but it gives the impression that humor has little force and is strangely superfluous, especially when these kinds of "serious" movies, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor has been directed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misadventures are not as ingenious or concentrated as Atkinson's silent-film jokes as he embodies Bean's character.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrates Britain’s super-secret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the distress of the serving agent, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the pinnacle for a pompous and conflicting prime minister who is already suffering a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that as all active spies have committed, you will need to remove someone from the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at some snobbish institution, but gives unofficial classes on how to become an undercover agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunite with their long-suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captaincy, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat lost.
As Batman and Robin return to action, they encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous hawks: dressed as waiters, they set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; they create a riot that illegally puts them aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
Of course, all the arrests come out of the latter sequence, but just as kind and scandalous as it is, it seems to be taken from a children's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does his talent justice?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they charge for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make Britons work four days a week, but cover five days a week.
Presumably, the party wants employers to pass on the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same salary.
The sources say the idea would “fit” into the party’s economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported the four-day-a-week rounds as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party’s approach to balancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party does not fully support the ambition.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day work week does not enter the party’s politics and is not being considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to bolster his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “speculators” in public service companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies will not recover all of their investment, as a Labour government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector companies’ shares to employees, which pocket annual dividends worth up to ?500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week. The question is raised as to whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw his support.
On Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said I'd go to the hearing.
I called him after the indictment came out and asked him if he had done so.
He was firm, determined, and resounding.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be immovable.
“My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and would make an explosive indictment,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened; but I know this: Brett flatly denied it,” Graham said.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive poster of acting stars and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event to end poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the attending audience had to complete a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by Global Citizen 12 years after achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to ask for action or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism,” people who think it makes a difference by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its followers, boosting a range of different goals.
These actions have helped spur global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than $2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and enforcer society that has pledged to “help children develop to their full potential,” with a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition’s ambassador, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as with the great anti-apartheid and civil rights movements that precede us, we will succeed, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to carry out a “blockade” to hinder Russia’s energy exports, the U.S. Home Secretary said.
"If necessary," Washington can resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at the behest of legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade in energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the officer, they have the means and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the capacity, along with the navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy is not going to the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, considering that, in practice, it is the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as having “only one tactic” with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements came as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace that of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was set to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance got the reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry’s leading organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” BDI president Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to Carefully Consider 2020 Candidacy for President, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully examine her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” he said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for president.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public meeting, saying he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was frank in his criticisms of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented in a tweet “of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote.”
However, in a poll published on Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren’s own voters do not believe he will run in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator would not run, according to a survey by the University of Suffolk's Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the bid.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other top Democrats in connection with a possible 2020 bid include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press news agency reported.
Sarah Palin Cites Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) from Track Palin at Donald Trump’s Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, they were arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what’s happening again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers come back with,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans, "return different, hardened, wondering if there is any respect for what fellow militiamen and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun at the same time he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy in relation to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district submitted a court-friendly report in Washington to support a policy-defying asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name of Grace Sessions v. the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
Detivérona in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be adjudicated according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and this prohibition violates that principle,” the court’s friendly report explained.
Prosecutors continued to debate in the report that policy that rejects the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide manpower.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems (including all serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation got worse and worse.
“Circumstances are very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her febrile baby at the evacuation center of the downed city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save whatever they found.
There are hundreds of people injured and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong aftershocks.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in the city.
“I listened to my wife ask for help and then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope you are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Abuse With 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper proclaiming the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, referred to the China Daily pay supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. Congressional elections on Nov. 6, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials coined on Reuters as a new phase of Washington’s growing campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to post ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in a growing trade war witnessing tariff levels being leveled on their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the US, China’s countervailing tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to harm exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a leading exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
In an op-ed written by Branstad and published in Sunday’s edition of the Moines Register, it was exposed that China “is intensifying this campaign of harassment by broadcasting propaganda ads in the free American press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, at the newspaper stand at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese can have about China’s worrisome economic trajectory, given that the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He also said that "one of China's most important newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm which newspaper it was.
The Kavanaugh disaster is losing the Republican women’s vote just days before the midterm elections.
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite different allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent backlash, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans were positioned to move forward with the vote.
“These things can’t be undone,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, said in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) final hour for an FBI investigation was enough to soothe angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, opponents of the "November approach!" flu protested in the Senate aisle, while Republicans, controlled by the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democrats’ motivation and enthusiasm will outweigh any expectations,” Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told reporters.
“It’s already high,
But it will be even more so, especially among the undecided women voters in the suburbs or those between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, don’t usually go to the polls.”
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggested it was possible to suffer a violent backlash if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
"This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench of the defendants or not. The problem is how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect the Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between whether to believe the testimony of Ford or that of Kavanaugh, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony entirely or probably, compared to 35% who support Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% believe Kavanaugh is most likely to be lying during his testimony, compared to 30% who think the same of Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of drunkenness when she was 17.
In contrast, Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her the genitals at a college party when she was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee hailed Inrupt's intention as "to dominate the world".
“We have to,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store online" or POD.
You can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to its president John Bruce, is for the company to provide the appropriate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-owned security company, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to Facebook or Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would change their business models overnight.
“We don’t need your permission.”
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based website.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has risen as an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
During the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Tribute to Bernard Vann, cleric awarded with the Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergyman in the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were tasked with discovering a memorial in his honor at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the feat of his grandfather that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the yoke of intense machine gun fire".
He later rushed to the line of fire and, with "great courage", directed the line forward before rushing with a cannon and no help from anyone, and knocking down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something he could never live with, but a lesson still.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which spearheaded the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero is demonstrated by the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts the roll to MMA fans at the best time
Imagine that you take the entire night awake to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when the best part arrives something stops you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 fights, with six being the main ones, and was broadcasting live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were going to see each other, viewers in the UK were puzzled when they saw the Peppa Pig appear.
Some were not impressed after spending so many hours waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these children's cartoons on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste".
“State law dictates that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., so it had to be switched to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that they will take viewers from the UK into account in future programming.
“I think we can solve it when we think about repetition,” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. there, we can’t fix it until Sunday, which is already Monday for them.
We are working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I started getting a lot of messages and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six. We wanted to give the most to our fans, but we passed and
It hurts a lot.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims that he didn’t realize that everyone was like him until he got to high school.
Guest on the first broadcast of the Radio 4 program Desert Island Discs led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began to talk about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this show, is on sick leave.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked the boys and girls."
“To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what drove me and gave me the strength to succeed.”
I wanted to prove that I was “someone” so that people would not be disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, she became a prominent LGBT activist and used her appearance in the Commonwealth of Australia games to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to talk because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with U.S. director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was a complete surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them have never been a problem.
"When you live so long in such a short time" (at the age of 14 he first participated in an Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth caused Daley to completely change his perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But now I know there are things that are far more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie.”
Her son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley’s father wouldn’t accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son for was tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him I wouldn’t be here to occupy that front row,” Daley shared.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that very moment, at the moment of his death, when I realized that he was really not invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“At that moment I knew that that was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,” he said.
The choice of Heather Small's song Proud is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on tip.

Mickelson in low form ended up on Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will need to improve his technique so that it does not turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed on the bench by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in fourballs or foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, like so many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although he was never the most accurate of players, not even at the peak of his career, at the age of 48 he does not fit on the tight Le Golf National course, where tall grass usually punish the wrong shots.
And in case that wasn’t enough, Mickelson faces off in Sunday’s ninth game to the precise Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below starting the 12 individual games, start off on a good foot, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he couldn't say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role he was playing today, he patted me on the shoulder, he passed my arm and he told me that tomorrow he would be ready,” Furyk shared.
“He was fully confident in himself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think he played two games.
I thought I’d play more, but in the end that’s what it is and we thought it should be.
Like everyone else, I want to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record in the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, a career that never reached the level of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven half-timbers, though Furyk claims his presence also provides intangibles for the team.
“He’s a fun, sarcastic person, with genius and he likes to get involved with people, he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he explained.
“I like to see how good the youngest players have been with him this week.
He’s more of a good player.”
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn fears vanishing advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup singles can easily turn into an inconvenient journey.
The Great Dane debuted in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended up reaching the finish line with a minimum lead winning 141-2-131-2.
"You still think that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; as in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won by little," reflects Bjorn, in the photo, after watching the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for it all.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This doesn’t end until the points are on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we need to focus on that.
I won’t get tired of saying it, I’m focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I’m also very aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted by the performance of his players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory ahead of time.
Tomorrow we will meet another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of the individual performances, and then we have to prove our worth.
It’s great to be with a partner by your side when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you test your ability as a golfer to the fullest.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than his teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of these last-day rounds, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but ending up as a loser after the European miracle at Medinah.
"I remember every damn word," he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players to the final day.
"We have 12 major games, but you would like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the momentum going in one direction, there’s a lot of pressure in those intermediate games.
We prepared our line-up with this in mind and put the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and take on Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
“I’ve decided on this order because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn explained about his selection for the individuals.
Germany's new warship once again postponed
The German Navy's newest frigate should have been delivered in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won't arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and increasing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery issues affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-heretic and anti-ship missiles, as well as concealment technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy the newer frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continual delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "crucial software and hardware flaws" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the necessary personnel on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to have dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as the ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the total project price, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it already reaches the staggering amount of €3.1 billion, compared to the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of the newer frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is taking water.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships to deploy.
The officer claims that this problem is growing, as the old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
A sound analysis performed by experts of all recordings will determine the frequency of calls of bats and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape-scale image of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as prairie creation and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affects children and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightening also pose a risk, as do glue traps for flies, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic surveys, inspections of children and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization has even the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland at the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson, estate manager, states that this is the ideal territory for them.
“In Threave we have a large area for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things we don’t yet know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
It emphasizes the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on the property, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity child can kill up to 400 females and offspring, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or molest them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"There's still a lot to learn about bats, and for many species, we don't know how it's doing to their populations."
Ronaldo dismisses rape lawsuits and lawyers prepare to sue German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the rape allegations against him false, claiming that the only thing he wants people to do is make themselves known using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus frontman was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
The footballer reportedly paid the woman $375,000 to not say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after its publication, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
“No, not a thousand times.
What was said today is false,” said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or.
"People want to know each other using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it's part of my job.
“I’m a happy and respectable man,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they describe as “an inadmissible statement of suspicions in the area of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, knelt down saying that he was 99% a gentleman, but that 1% betrayed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirms that the two had sexual relations agreed by both parties.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt terrified by retaliation and was concerned about public scorn.
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to revoke the agreement while remaining traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Carmakers would leave the UK
The United Kingdom would forever regret losing its position as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, according to Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark.
He added that it was worrying that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need to reach an agreement,” Clark added.
The Japanese automaker said that if Brexit did not reach an agreement, the impact of delays at the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which is in charge of manufacturing Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, we will be witnessing how production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s general manager in Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of automakers is the supply chain risk in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very tight, every 37 minutes pieces arrive from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, the border could be affected and delays and shortages of pieces could result.
The company says it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks.”
"It is essential to have a deal, and we want it to be the best deal, to enjoy the current success but also to make the most of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“Toyota and other manufacturers’ experience is that we need to continue these excellent supply chains.”
Toyota could not estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant's competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year Burnaston employee and Unite union coordinator, said its members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A government spokesman said they had presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
The White House said the high-risk meeting of Donald Trump and Undersecretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed another week because of the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Russia’s aides and Trump, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein talked about using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president under the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is not yet a fixed date, it could be this week or be delayed another week, given everything that is happening in the supreme court.
We’ll see, but you know I like the press to be informed.”
Some journalists questioned that claim, as Sanders has been without a press conference since September 10.
When Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to the reporters' grandloquy, although she added that she would not be the one to deny that attitude.
He also suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president," he said, though he did not cite any sources that endorsed the data.
Sanders said: “If the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, that’s much better than addressing the questions to her.
You’re witnessing how we’ve been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can speak directly to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, solo press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a free appearance and on rare occasions before the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Ministry of Health to calm the mood in the face of Brexit
The health secretary addressed a letter to EU workers at the NHS in Scotland expressing the country’s gratitude and expressing their wish to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government is committed to covering the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working on its decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment have continued, and it is planned to reach the decisions this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal situation.
I know this is a time of anxiety for everyone.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
The partners of the European Union and beyond, provide indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay with us.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a linebacker for the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State coach, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before break.
Apparently, he fainted when he got to the band line.
Coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen in the band line before taking him to the stretcher for a later evaluation.
A technician from Tennessee State informed Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He added that there are no details yet of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in a red jersey, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five innings in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his total to 18 of the season.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher doorbell tax when they purchase a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
The stamp tax increase will apply to those people who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury hopes to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher doorbell tax when they purchase a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to lure young voters with promises to promote more affordable housing and focus on high-income people.
The stamp tax increase will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will be used to support the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rent, may be up to 3%.
The company expects the exchange to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13% of new construction in London is bought by non-residents in the UK, which is driving up prices and making it harder for people who want to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson applied for a tax cut to help new people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping home prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenue on moderately priced homes to fix the “shame of the housing sector” that lives in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reform proposals, including controlling renters and banning foreclosures in which the tenant is not to blame.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
“Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
To do this, we need to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as simple for those people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing as it is for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far off, and the indignity of not having a roof remains too real.”
Jack Ross: “My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland”
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "last ambition" was to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northwestern club, which currently ranks third in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played in the B team once, and that’s all,” Ross told the BBC’s Sportsound.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a kid, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic claims that he felt no concern about succeeding such established figures in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Will success depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly the property of a Premier League club,” he said.
“It’s not going to be an easy task to get there, but it’s likely that I’ll only consider it a success here if I can return the club to the Premier League.”
Ross only takes three years as a coach after a period as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month period within the Hearts technical staff.
In that period, he helped Alloa recover from the downhill draw in the third division and managed to get St Mirren to move from falling to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he ever found himself during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was probably at a real crossroads,” he recalled, about taking over Alloa.
“I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because I didn’t get it wrong, I earned my life reasonably well and I enjoyed some successes.
Playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you need to overcome each week.
I continue to suffer from stress and work pressure, but I like to train.
I’ve always enjoyed training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to have a drink is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heatwave has increased consumption in more difficult British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced 2.7 percent growth during July, but restaurant consumption fell 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of CGA's business advisory board, who compiled the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's longer-than-expected stay in the world of football caused a similar pattern to that of June to appear in July, in which pubs enjoyed a 2.8 percent increase in consumption, although restaurants suffered an even greater punishment.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant turnover during June worsened during July.
Pubs and bars specializing in beverages were the ones with the best results with increases in consumption exceeding the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specializing in food also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It’s like people just want to go out and drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, beverage consumption increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food consumption decreased by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, an employee at RSM, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events remain the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8% per year will be especially painful if this is added to the continuous increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering business and time will be in charge of saying whether the moderation of temperatures experienced during August will provide the much-needed respite for the sector.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The UK pubs, bars and restaurants industry’s sales indicator “Coffer Peach Tracker Industry” collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with combined profits of more than 9 billion pounds and is considered the industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages.
This news has led to increased fears of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account to show their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts (referring to the social photo-sharing network Instagram).
This news has raised fears of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they used a "main" softened account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who ran into the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl who asked her to be "raped".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC chief executive Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that there are so many teens tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the council of the Scottish athletics federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from their extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from its incorporation into the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to serving as a spokesperson for the athletes and hope to be able to contribute and help direct the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic gold medals and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from being able to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I currently do axility exercises.
“Thanks for the messages of encouragement.”
An ad from a breast milk extractor comparing women with cows divides public opinion on social media
A company of breast milk extractors has divided public opinion in the networks with an advertisement in which it compares to nursing mothers with cows to which they are milking.
To announce the launch of the world’s first silent portable breast milk extractor, Elvie has released an ironic music video ad to demonstrate the freedom the new breast milk extractor offers to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of ugliness for the cows to the rhythm of a song with lyrics like the following: "Yes, I moved myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you don't realize it, they're not ugars, they're my boobs".
The chorus continues: “Mother, mother, I’m feeding babies, mother, mother, I’m mulching my friends.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that this highlights the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we rob them of their children days after giving birth.”

Another viewer commented: “Clearly traumatic for mother and baby.
But why aren’t they used to advertise a milk extractor for the mothers left with their babies?”
Another viewer added the following: “What an announcement with so little tact.”
Other viewers defended the announcement, even a woman said the song seemed "very funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
Taking out my milk made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is a bit silly, but I interpret it as a joke.
It’s a great product,” he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they have been dancing with discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be discreetly fitted into a maternal bra, which gives women the freedom to move around, hold their babies and even go out there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative executive director of Mother commented: “The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallels between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it entails while demonstrating in an entertaining way and close to the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time Elvie has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently marched to a Texas border camp
The number of migrant children detained has increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration making it difficult to assign sponsors to the children.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their homes would have to submit their fingerprints and that that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“About 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or are part of their household are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to persecute these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In order to prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court before a month has elapsed since their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconferencing instead of in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and system reports released in recent months.
Lawyers said these fears are heightened in larger centers such as the Screw Center, where there is a greater chance that the symptoms of a child having a bad time go unnoticed due to their size.
They also added that moving children to the campground without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could be trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He also said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem declared that they were giving themselves the right conditions for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "spread of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
“We are turning to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last large rebel stronghold of Idlib has allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions would target jihadists, including soldiers from the al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra front, which would be "eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem laid out the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would get re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting for, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
It would be the “most dramatic end of a presidency.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have increased more than two-fold to reach 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million from four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the ratings of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers on the nights of major news.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, showrunner for ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," she has another theory.
It reminds me of a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell said.
There is entertainment within the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the plots that emerge from Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, suppose something that goes beyond being an informed citizen to spend six hours watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of “anonymous” sources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skinned bomber jacket (“a garment full of arrogance,” the Washington Pos claimed) and the implications of the scandals.
I’m not going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what makes it seem like a reality show is that it’s giving you something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” a space that deals with the changes in the characters and the daily plot twists of Trump’s show (the conflict with the N.F.L., the praises to Kim Jong-un...).

When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was on the verge of confronting the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court by hanging a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back then and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Foreign money reaches moraines to fund the candidatures to the House for the elections of the half of the legislature
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives in office in the race to occupy the same position.
This newly reorganized district on the outskirts of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic nominee Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is presented against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans had manipulated the electoral districts of the old districts in their favor.
The election race in the new 17th congressional district unleashed a campaign finance festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after achieving a narrow victory in the March special elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed wide follow-up.
That position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China and then backtracked.
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a pleasant meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners launched the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to order the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "by recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the possibility of sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was only discussed.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would prove very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from emigrating to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions being applied to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance he attaches to the administration, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any harsh new messages or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations as long as the participants' anonymity was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and he also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was maintained.
Studying History
The next negative case could be Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on the case of possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s justice, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public archive.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to give an account to that body, just when he has to prepare for the elections, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
These are many unknowns and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, as is that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to strike a coup against Hitler if the Western front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that occurred later.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy has accelerated or receded.
Americans are facing several of these tipping points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has carried the water up his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times information was not true.
“How are we going to respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not impartial or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witnessing?
And, above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, thanks to the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was the seat of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to hang Shabbat candies on that table that included a swastika.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win against the Austrians, after the impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain this same month, would put them in a very favorable position to qualify in the Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season to a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to achieve more important things.
“It was a good point for us, as Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game thinking we could get something positive and we got a point.
We had the chance to win in the end, but overall, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were superior.
Next week is going to be another great night.
We hope to be able to achieve the three points, but it will be difficult, because they achieved a good result in their last match, but with the support of our audience, I am sure that we will be able to fight for a positive result.
Last year was tough between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that occurred in the team, but there is an excellent environment at the moment.
The team is good, the kids are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the last season and succeed.”
Women are worried about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants were clear on how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this Nationwide study said they discussed with their partners the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they’re not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance department.
You can start with the next one.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t communicate your wishes to them long in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family to agree on where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider signing a notarial power to manage your finances.
You’ll need to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you’re incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your older father or mother has a medical emergency and goes on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down this information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.

A man is shot with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe.
One man was shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after leaving at night.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not serious and the police are looking for potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, killed at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to rise.
Due to the breakdown of communications, the rescue corps were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Celebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in the year 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that lies along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regency, an administrative region smaller than a province, had an approximate population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic pillars of Central Celebes Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Fire Belt of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004 - A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra, which occurred on December 26, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009 – A 7.6-magnitude earthquake occurs near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and killed approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the regency of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time around, but more than 100 people died due to the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, resulting in the deaths of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charge
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, preventing a complaint of domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a statement published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he removed her phone.
Palin remains in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, in which he pleaded "not guilty, from the outset," when asked, the jail said.
Palin faces three Type A misdemeanors, which means he could enter prison for up to a year and receive a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a type B misdemeanor, punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to the PTSD syndrome he suffers from after serving with the army in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds in Indonesia
There are at least 384 deaths after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death toll is expected to increase over the course of days.
The earthquake occurred just opposite Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos through social networks in which the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors try to apply a few times the death penalty for the suspect in a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bike lane attack on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway, reaping the lives of pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and that he caused them serious injuries “intentionally,” according to the notification of the intention to apply for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors of organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "remarkable planning and premeditation", prosecutors said in describing the way Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South District of New York has not prosecuted a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no repentance during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos he viewed on his phone according to the indictment.
He also asked to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He was found not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys in charge of representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the indictment's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilt with life imprisonment without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize an army of people" today during a Tory conference protest.
The former leader of the UK’s Independence Party said politicians had to “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested he should take care of negotiations with the EU).
In a statement to the rally in Birmingham, the UK “would have left” the EU if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But May’s challenge to reconcile the divided ranks of her party has come to light as she joins the pro-EU Tories in an independent anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the commitments of her Chequers plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, the opposites and the EU.
His allies insisted that he keep fighting to try to get a deal with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated at the concentration of Solihull's Leave Means Leave movement that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been counted on to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in office, we would have been out of the EU at this time,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan.”
He said: “We don’t fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false.”
Tories member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march, from which she told reporters: “All I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity among the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the rally that it is necessary to make politicians “uncomfortable” if they intend to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray the Brexit decision and here we are gathered today to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us the victory on Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved banners with the Tories Against Brexit message after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in a party implementation at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frictionless border, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider her candidacy for president following the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a town hall session in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for reelection in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been the focus of speculation that puts her as Trump’s successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the city hall format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it’s time that “women go to Washington to fix our government’s problems, and that’s why we need a woman in the presidency.”
An arrest has been made related to the deadly shooting of Sims, the LSU player.
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who was going out in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result of this,” Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2-meter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, who started from pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first and let Hamilton race with traffic in the back of the group, something that would be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in pits a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton delayed it after several wheel-to-wheel maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to be reluctantly free from the interior at the risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of the starting grid and climbed back to seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tyres to get faster in the final and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually pitted on lap 44 but could not advance any position in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places," Hamilton said.
An Inappropriate Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for insisting he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an event in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and instead commented that what was happening in the Senate proved people to be “miserable, disgusting and lying.”
“The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the outrage, when you see the people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying,” she said.
“When you look at these posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t go.
I wasn’t.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make any leaks?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document?: "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I wasn't.
Wait a minute.
"No," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t filter her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“Pedia kept his confidentiality and I did what he asked me to do.”
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented on the following during Saturday night's event: "I tell you that body language was not the right one.
He may not have filtered it, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repugnant, no matter who they hurt, who they have to run into to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars spotted the defeat suffered on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead with two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the local team before Dwyer re-established the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to rebound to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three wins ahead of the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal came in the 3:35 minute thanks to assistance from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after assistance from David Rutherford.
In an initial period of upheaval, Sullivan re-joined the local team in match no. 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to score the tie goal no. 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead of the scoreboard before the first break when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard tied the match again with a power play goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen advance Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured the win by their team's fifth goal in the latter half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play home at Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of plane passengers can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller considered a hero after dying to make sure a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
The death toll is 800 and there are many missing after a major earthquake shakes the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area and many people are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the violently swinging Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu airport control tower.
He remained in place to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could save hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take you to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It breaks our hearts to find out,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be thousands and the country’s disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the rubble and not many of them have been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the minimarkets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini claims missing after plane crash in Micronesia
The airline that operates a flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims there is a missing after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew had left the sinking plane without incident.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not been able to locate a passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed from the runway to the landing strip.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered with very little height.
“That’s an extremely positive thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to move through the water reaching their waist to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who were working close to the site on shipyard upgrade tasks also assisted in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline crashes recorded in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but none has affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors turned back to the trials on Saturday in a repeat of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial, she described to the jury how she used cell phone records to replenish the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis met Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his earlier claims, according to The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When these data showed that his mobile phone was meeting Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the podium on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“It’s all about your life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would remain for trial by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What Is Mindful Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol-based group, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and the fight against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get combative hip hop back to being popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A New York City child care provider is suing a couple after a "racist" message.
A New York City childcare provider will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from her mother in which she complained that she was "another black".
The couple denies being racist and compares the demand to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed her anguish when she discovered that child caregiver Giselle Maurice was black when she showed up on her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOON, ANOTHER BLACK," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the caregiver who had just left, that she was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipina according to the New York Post's announcement.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her work day and sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice will sue the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for which she had initially been hired even if there was no contract through.
“Look, I want to show you that these things don’t happen,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to accusations of racism by stating that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid to be able to trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent him a message that she had no intention of sending him.
It's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it was because of a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on!"
After comparing the lawsuit to "extortion", Plasco said his wife had just had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to go for someone like that?”
That’s not very ethical,” added the investment banker.
As the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear according to whether it could be concluded in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself on the skin of a person who first reads it before it's published.
It’s really fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
After claiming that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agridescent" after his death last year.
De Paddington, described as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he eventually achieved.
“He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous,” he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you’re proud even if you didn’t really do it.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
After landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad would call regularly to say he was very bad, that he wasn't expected to survive.
“Then I got Nad’s call to tell me that I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medications that doctors gave him for his heart to continue latticing were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
He had died a while ago and now he was shutting down.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by people and families.
I had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in that moment of mourning over the loss of her daughter, entered the plane with the other passengers, without noticing the ordeal she was suffering.
“No one detected him,” he said.
“My head was down and my tears were falling all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Postcards of women afflicted to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said their smile lit up any room.”
However, he left the job before he died and was "in a very deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented, “I have continued concern that a side effect will occur.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day touched deep (when the children opened their gifts, he made no eye contact with them or anything).”
He said his death posed a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: "He tore the family apart.
Dishonest us.
But we have to go forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), it's possible that we could get some unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was being "erased" due to the paralysis of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
His reluctance is due to a question of deadlines.
Five weeks to go until the midterm elections (November 6th). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling in senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI reports?
There will be a Senate vote, which currently occupies 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea drops under Kim's mandate
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un's accession to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defections during the past year, far from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tightening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs on people on the other side of the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of defectors in the North were eventually offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority fled through China, which has the largest stretch of border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between north and south (which technically continue to be at war) have improved markedly in recent months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they roughly agreed to work to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and under those circumstances there is no chance that we will disarm unilaterally first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is not fit to enter the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not suited by nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever behaved that way, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied accusations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, on occasion almost screaming and speaking while describing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputation murder" organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not access the Supreme Court because it proved that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he is confirmed in office and if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is, if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then you're not fit to be in the Supreme Court, but in the court you're in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about any resolutions Kavanaugh could adopt against the Patient Protection and Accessible Health Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
On confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh dodged questions about whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be overturned.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the courtroom and still above us expect us to say, look what good!" Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise it.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and you cannot expel it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that weird, do I?”
She went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she got angry, but who developed a technique that was that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then, I continued.
It seemed brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, in which I began to cry with an indescribable rage, was that an older woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a distant superior who had always provoked me with a slight fear, and led me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll comfort you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacies.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was taken on an off-marriage adventure on a ship named Monkey Business and retired from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” I laughed 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was advanced, he was delayed in raising funds, so he vowed he would not enter the race for the presidency unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters contributed $1,000 to male candidates and only $250 to her.
“What do you think, I have a discount?” he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not present a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported her, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates, and of anger at existing sexism) that ran out of words.
"You'd think she had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
“You’d think Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"Crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could turn out for Beijing
The initial bombings of the U.S.-China trade war were frightening, and although the war is far from over, distancing between countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year recording key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200 billion, taxing half of the items coming to the United States from China.
Beijing counterattacked in the same way, most recently raising tariffs from five to ten percent on $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has vowed to imitate U.S. measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will remain unchanged in the short term.
To get Washington to back down, it would be necessary to yield to their demands, but to bow publicly to the United States would be much more embarrassing to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions to initiate an economic crisis in both countries is actually far more dangerous than was previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security, a research center.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions were improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore normality.
All necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods are now in place.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another 6 million people are still living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it could receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he said he would not accept conditional aid from countries that support the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive U.S. defeat on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle he offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the 16th hole of par 3, losing his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has shone through all of his series, becoming one of the only four players to score a 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst-ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World leader Dustin Johnson lost 2&1 to England’s Ian Poulter, who is likely to have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups contested, the Spaniard Sergio García became the European player with the most wins in the tournament, with 25.5 points.
“I don’t cry often, but today I can’t help it.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to win back the cup.
The important thing is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in Sunday's individual game.
“It’s amazing how proud I am today to have been able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, a 14-major winner, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled throughout the weekend not to leave the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, the Europeans were in trouble.
We fight.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
The 12 players played well.
We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I want these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to take off the hat.
They were superior.”
Information on the red tide: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the most recent report from the Florida Wildlife and Fisheries Conservation Commission, there is a general reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the commission, increasingly unequal conditions are being observed in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and in the counties of Collier, which may mean that concentrations are being reduced.
The red tide extends approximately 210 km from the northern counties of Pinellas to the southern counties of Lee.
Concentrations can be found 16 km off the coast of Hillsboroug County, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Red tide was also found in Pasco County.
Middle-level concentrations on or off the coast of Pinellas County last week, background and high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background and high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, background and middle-level concentrations in Charlotte County, background and high concentrations on or off the coast of Hillsborough County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, cases of respiratory irritation continue to occur.
No such cases have been reported in Northwest Florida in the past week.
