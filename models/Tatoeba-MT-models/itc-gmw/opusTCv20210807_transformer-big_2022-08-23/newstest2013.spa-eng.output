A Republican strategy to obstruct Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of U.S. governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that made it difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011, 180 bills were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
New electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the ballot, and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 elections, no state required voters to present a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law.
The Republican government hastened to extend the practice to other states.
In recent years, authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike what happens in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with those characteristics.
But often, obtaining the required ID costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to file such a request.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit Hispanic voting.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers backed in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of the election in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 brought the registration rate for new voters down in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored shorter voting in advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter represented only 13% of the state’s voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the same thing happened.
They represent only 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent only 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fiercely opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
The damage could be limited in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that with them it is intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have passed such laws account for 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this regard, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Getting Tested or Not Getting Tested?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It’s more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant in themselves, doubt whether or not screening tests should be done.
To take the test or not?
We asked two experts for advice.
Studies in the United States detected a high rate of infection among the sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of suffering metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from age 50, or from age 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin have a higher rate of risk.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of their cancer. They should be given all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not threaten long-term life, in which case they should instead opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, as it is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it’s important to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not you should get tested.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle prescription to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others are still completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other cancers.
It greatly harms people’s health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic, and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular, lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer.”
The Food Industry
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, they escalate the risks of colorectal cancer.
Deli products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment his investigations are inconclusive.
According to CSC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about each person’s concerns and family history with their doctor.
"Doing the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in effect, that this boson is a partaker of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what’s more, it’s about the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or “least bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists it’s not entirely clear that it’s Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely sure.
Anyway, we assume it's Higgs, because the chances of making mistakes seem small. We'll see what it's about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and don’t try too hard, because it will end up being hurt.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly speaking, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratories’ The Particle Adventure website, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the “particles of force”, by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, I would point out here, are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if he manages to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "light particle" that acts as the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this “disorder” an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon; that is, one of the “force-carrying” bosons.
Most Stable Field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it requires reaching extremely high energies, a bit like an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide over the surface.
That’s why it takes an immense particle accelerator like CERN (the big hadron collider is a 27 km ring in circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick by itself to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way) do not.
Now, what can all these investigations "contribute"? asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and predictions of the MS.
For their part, many fervently want them to meet, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that plugs certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, such as not proposing any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
Consequences
The repercussions of such research in our day-to-day life are hard to predict, but we don’t think we’re wrong to say that it won’t have any.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution their work would bring about.
They looked at scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who produced the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, said that at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light collector in 1969 over the course of his optics research.
Although it was not its original intention at all, this pickup now serves as an “eye” for all the digital devices in the world, which earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In his Dying in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently discussed the delicate end-of-life issue.
The debate should resume soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Le Devoir has tried to see it up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
“I had been given five years to live, but I’ve been like that for seven years,” he says, making a pass, lying on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resignation to help him eat.
Brave, he even comes to smile, to talk to strangers who give him attention, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
“My biggest wish is for diarrhea to be cured, it’s humiliating,” she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
“Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man steps on his feet,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
Going back to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he notes.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer “curative” care.
The biggest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is dying “consciously and drowned.”
But the disease has made her discover her children.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
“I don’t have any more desires left in this life,” she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And she expects, in the coming days, a final visit from her son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aids.
They are palliative care that is given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have one bed of palliative care for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It’s very little, as we know that we’ll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the demand.
Diabetics are no longer controlled on their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died over the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois Centre, the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man enjoying his last family reunion in the yard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after trying everything to survive.
“For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who have cancer,” said Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois Arrivals Center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care facility.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the home palliative care society of the Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this large relative shortage in Quebec’s healthcare that makes many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by palliative care eminences, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, is circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
“Recently,” she relates, “I’ve seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering great pain without the necessary steps being taken to relieve her.
I’m afraid patients want to die just because they don’t get the right care.”
And at the same time, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard’s survival hopes were already low when she left for exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that she wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank their caregivers for not attending to their demands once their pain has been eased thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can’t pretend we don’t understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want to be relieved.”
The making of this report has been made possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from the Canadian health research institutes.
Large-Scale Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP businessmen, fundraisers of political parties and Italian mafia specialists tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable “system”, of which the construction industry is part, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
An "industry" that came out too expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system gets pulverized once we’ve hunted down the big media,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec deputy and former Montreal police chief.
He led the outburst of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible thanks to a thorough investigation into road contract embezzlements in Quebec, which then-liberal prime minister Jean Charest had only agreed to delay.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to keep a proportionate share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, while hoping to be able to "demonstrate the stratagems existing behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government intervenors, investigators and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the "Marteau Squadron" cops, who, since 2009, have made Montreal's "sewer cartel" moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
Over the past few weeks, the unit has been recording allegations of fraud and corruption against city officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally accused.
The latter has caused shock when explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For three years he paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money left and right during the 2000s, granting more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the ruling liberals.
He also admitted to organizing a collection of illegal funds for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills between 30% and 40% for fake extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filling his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of the campaign money was dirty money
Of the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she says she pulls "a thread to be able to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and fish the culprits."
He added that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We’re cleaning up the wounds but it would take a clean investigation unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that the dubious practices don’t repeat themselves.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, meanwhile, states that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is concerned mostly about the role of “politicians elected to the stratagem.”
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was used to finance electoral campaigns in Quebec, she ironizes: “I’ve been told that’s nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes limiting donations to $100 to parties, but that won’t change the donation, according to him, “as long as election expenses aren’t strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: “we can’t fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws.”
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
PSG is not FC Barcelona!
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Advance day by day by your side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't warm up.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by leaps and bounds.
You will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They know that every workout is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
It’s backed by adjuncts like Claude Makelele, who was playing in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like him in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think other titles will be held in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first half of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken away our leadership position.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the final eighths in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to start, to finish the first of our league against Porto in order to receive the round of eighths in the final.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is committed to its means to make this project a reality.
Would not winning the cup in League One, like last season, be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we’re going to put all our efforts into taking that champion title.
In the last season we didn’t get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be good.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home at Troyes, that they still run into things to blame is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to start a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have not managed to qualify for the eighth final, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better to say that we have a "Zlatandependence".
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and he scores a lot of goals.
He has come to prove that he is the star of League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams that he has gone through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out strengthened.
Today I managed to play good matches in the national team.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the "blues."
We have learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and that is why we have exemplary behaviour today.
What vision do you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the "blues"?
You're getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
This was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the national team to Brazil.
Did the (1-1) draw on October 16 in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Each fought for everyone.
“Before that shock in Spain, I hadn’t experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer to peer.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
Bitcoin’s price, after peaking at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (quotes are censed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It’s not at all impressive when compared to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It described bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competing with the dollar or euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as “credits”, used to advance in a video game and which can be won by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both book keepers, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the form of e-mail.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are contained in the public ledger, which is spread throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge thrown at computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
It is a phase of file cutting, that is, of transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "slicing" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (plus zeroes at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, in order to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very fast (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be left orphaned, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward splits in two regularly, with probability before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins stolen in deposit.
“The failure used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Prominent actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the “giant sales” were launched.
“They changed $30,000,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, equates to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which then come out cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to start up in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
Just provide them with an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to take hold, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished, above all, the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done by order.
Convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban into Kabul as of the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of fighting between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants overtaken by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old Mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The leading figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, seizing government land to resell them as land for the refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting along with huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have taken advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to give jobs to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is fond of mobile phones. Television and its Turkish pamphlets presenting a modern world have great admirers all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the position of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been repaired, and important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only heightened the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them.
With no energy to extract iron or copper ores from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, letting international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) dig up the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the province’s top employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, will also need to restore normal relations.
French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a department of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to “win hearts and spirits” and perform the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of “civil and military actions” of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain towns.
These labors, greedy for local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increasing crop areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys often located more than 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and that reaches them directly.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on his final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And it has been almost two years since Egypt used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial scams.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his “autocratic delirium” and continues to “betray his word” and “piss the right.”
On the part of his supporters, he assures that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis faster and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either vote my text or I keep the full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, an Islamist majority, voted for the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 substitute members were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As might have been expected, the articles voted on were unanimous.
The commentators are pleased, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at the time of the prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent Assembly clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on late yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 remains the same as the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that “the principles of Sharia law constitute the principal source of law.”
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than an advertising hoax.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because “the people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are further heightened by the fact that the next rector of that university would be far less moderate than the current one.
“For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity about article 220, as the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
"We are referring specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ed].
And the question that could be asked in the future would be to what extent civil judges are competent to rule above all of this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another point of conflict: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the revision of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as called for by human rights associations.
They also showed their concerns regarding the text, which they consider liberticidous.
The crime of blasphemy continues and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to go out on television last night, demonstrations are expected for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
“AIF” identified the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the crowded nets.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are found in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Via Crucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins at the Fortress of Antonio, the Praetorium, where the trial was held, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Anointing Stone and to the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place there is also the symbolic Christian ombligo of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then come true.
Take a vertical journey
The ruins of Masada Fortress was what was left of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to be built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, can only those who engage in climbing.
Others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Until then, bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visiting Unique Museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
In one trip you won’t be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth visiting the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Entry is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop by 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustains even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing mud and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the Jaffa citadel, on the Mediterranean coast.
It ran along the famous sea route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls in the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples coming from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (currently 1-3$.8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travelling on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transhipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on the Sabbath.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning a new work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, flakless fish and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a variety of sauces, falafel, which are ground chickpea balls, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that “walk at will” in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Sprinklers love crowded places and don’t reject treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,800 Ukrainian tourists, a number that exceeded by 51% the same index as 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
'The Great and Powerful' Will Take You to Moscow: Immigrants Save for Language
As MPs and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the law on mandatory examination, smugglers have already appeared in the country who trade in “fake” certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
They are mostly citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed home.
As of December 1, a law comes into force, according to which every worker immigrant will have to take an exam to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail.
However, in time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, the exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to make the examination of the language, if not also that of Russian history and that of the foundations of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The exception is citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who obtained their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Usefulness, Fatality and Defense of Rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to test in all cities, currently more than 160 such centers are open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and by the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law came into force, have many times managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, respond the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "labor slavery".
Many people talk today about defending the rights of working immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Immigration Service representation in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without an understanding of the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be doomed to encounter unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put him on a “paid trip” to a creepy, narrow grave, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or papers, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages,” said Tolib Sharipov, head of the Tajikistan Immigration Service’s Labor Immigration Directorate.
Don't be angry, boss!
Meanwhile, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention dressing them, wearing them and buying them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these guys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It’s hard, if you don’t know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, when it comes to language law, advocates point to an important point.
The exams will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or Forbidden Passage to Strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a fake inscription can be made quickly and for only fifteen hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and extortion cases appear.
“They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,” Tajikistan’s Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be silly, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it became apparent that not only immigrant registration documents can be fake.
Several “false” certificates of language proficiency have already been seized by Federal Immigration Service officials.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker 3,000 rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, authorities can promise immigrant workers who would not have been able to pass the exam for the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government’s reaction to the recent incidents: Pressing shots during wedding celebrations in which luckily there were no casualties, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Pressing seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for gun licenses from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the gun ownership law will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the “hard-handed policy”.
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "nonsense rigor" be abandoned.
The percentage of recorded acts of vandalism with the use of weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov told the BBC news service in Russia.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012 142 crimes with the use of firearms were committed in internal organs, compared to a total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts weapons orders
The first, "remains of the army or military", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves," Baranets said.
The next type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were caused deliberately to cover the fault,” a former military official said.
According to Baranets, gun manufacturers also put their sand granite.
“They have now proliferated private weapons factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute cordoned weapons to the black market, including the Moscow one,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Many pistols and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes handmade, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” explains the former military.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal arms supply to the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and publicly accessible data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the investigators say, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market’s weapons have arrived there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to "illegal archaeology".
The clerk of one of the arms stores, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers turn to military warehouses when they need a match.
Through some clerk, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
“He takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers,” he tells us.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be carried out, they make trial purchases from illegal arms dealers,” the employee adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
“I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me went to the platform ‘Begovaya’ where there would be a man who would take me to a ‘squinite’ where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I found out only there.”
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there you also have to get there, say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I won’t let him know.
Newbies look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets was put to the test as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when an article on the subject was being published.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was "everything".
“I felt like in a luxury boutique,” recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered cat for hare: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, do not just buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
“They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop for sofas
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required for this.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the headline of the ad “Buy a gun or machine gun.”
There, users place their orders and ask questions.
Do they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Iván" (spelling preserved).
"I buy TT pistol. Moscow", laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handedly captures those who wish to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish, to bait, and then to coal mining in Siberia.

I have heard of these systems: the website is usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send him a photo and instructions to let him know where the weapon is hiding,” said Dmitry Kislov, the NGO’s press secretary on the right to arms.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an order is placed online, one is left without a gun and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handedly captures those who wish to buy firearms.
“And people go, like hungry fish, to bait, and then to coal mining in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
It will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, constituting 22,900, and the number of cases identified of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
U.S. Fast Food Restaurant and Supermarket Employees Strike
Up to a quarter of American teens find their first cashier jobs at "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against the low wages paid at Walmart corporation supermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and lie down in its early stages.
The protests are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the protest organizers aim to create workers’ unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
Shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday," which in the United States began the orgy of sales that captured millions of people, and which was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers at Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and left-wing activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products target people on modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That’s why many underpaid Walmart workers only shop on the job.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
That “Black Friday” protesters demanded wage increases and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
That’s about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the pay increase on the shoulders of consumers, every visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters are pleased that the protest took place in only nine states and that it caused no loss to the corporation.
Black Friday lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers made “Black Friday” nearly 100 million transactions.
The company’s representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website that they left their job “less than five” Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than “another PR stunt” organized by the workers’ union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and so for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it over time, but only slightly, and on average, regular workers receive $8.90 an hour in New York.
Nobody wins less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers went through McDonald’s and worked there, behind counters, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble into some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them.
The protesters, who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers’ unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from impeding this right and punishing union activists with wits and firings.
On the other hand, management rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of the staff.
Discordants
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald’s located near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, notably city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: “McDonald’s says he’s selling billions of servings, and then he doesn’t even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work.”
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, including the city’s mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said “we must support fast-food workers to achieve the fair wages and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As the New York Times described it, this has been the biggest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But it involved only a few hundred people, not all of whom were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York worked.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a mass movement.
“For now, cheating the brain isn’t that easy.”
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is normally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier this summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft’s Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, it was clear that for the company’s scientists, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are drawn to the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group's study?
- We are dedicated to the person-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
Despite the fact that Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world of computing must be liberated from ours, from the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, fuck off with those silly virtual reality headsets!
What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don’t you think they overestimate it?
- Of course it can not be considered a panacea, it remains pending to solve the issue of privacy, since you do not always want others to learn about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in looser movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device’s camera, but by a wristband that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- That is, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Are you lacking resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects human-machine interaction.
I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but it does not require contact for the frames per second to be more.
Is it not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the emitter of infrared rays and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible forehead sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
On the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the cameras’ location curvature and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that, from the point of view of daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smartphone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that’s their strength (private things only you will be able to see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also to any simple mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh burst in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the octave might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really geared towards bringing tangibility to these “images in the air,” for example, interference from several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to what one would feel if someone were blowing at one’s fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wristbands that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Did you try to trick the brain?
Does it make you think he feels what it seems like you should feel the moment you see something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to struggle with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, tricking the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, who find many things in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg Vanguardism", dedicated to the citizens who are in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg’s avant-garde of the late 80s – early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens the smiling inhabitants and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took an organelle and became the organeller of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to the appearance and the image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray arouses aggression and agitation of properties not good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the subsequent ones being exhibited in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I got into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
And all of this came together at your art clinic... and it was important to me to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to gather.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the house of Saint Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's Ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under a phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an animator for many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov Club, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regular clients were there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was "The people of our city".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination I was chosen, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very uncultivated.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in which the actuality and occurrence is clearly expressed.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns everything is embossed and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now one follows him by clothing, orienting oneself externally, but not inside the person.
And, maybe that person shouldn’t even be given a hand, but spit in the face.
And the deception will be eliminated when changing clothes.
A cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before, people grouped in herds, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons the other.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come by thousands!
- The abandoned ones will see it, there the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event 300 people go, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When I was young I made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that’s another story.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: a culture official.
But not all of them are dedicated to culture.
When the kings were the right ones everything was different, the kings perhaps did not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the experts right.
There are now very good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level are needed to properly evaluate these and open their way.
Now the subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural background and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is insignificant.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be executed with a St. Petersburg grant.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with humans on board set out in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same replacement planet?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
“These are Venus and Mars,” says Sternberg P.K. (IAES) chief researcher Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora.
A half-century ago, experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ at all from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, drosophila.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of pregnancy.
As a result, we get a normal chick.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stay on its own feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, the chicks would randomly flip.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the trouble was that after four days they were just dying.
“And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left because it was impossible to work there with them,” says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
“This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instincts.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
Women have been traveling in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our gull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question,” says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of spaceflight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, we count the astronauts who after long flights everything has worked out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
“And if you can say more, it’s dangerous even on orbital flights,” summarizes cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is his native element.
The small amphibian-men seem to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside its mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little to forget about,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation, the force of gravity is necessary.
In weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepitize very quickly, the ability of the fetus to eject is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, this will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress in a special training suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally ill-adapted person,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, in time this will be a reality, when the humans on your ships are heading to a faraway planet that will be home for your space-born children.
Head of NKI: Inspection of the system "Avarc" has not come to the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is lame.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NK) in an interview with Aktuáln.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," thus describes the current situation.
The joint checks of the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Neșas's attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the system of "varc".
The prime minister recently said that the SDG (Democratic Civic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspectors. So is it prohibited or allowed?
“The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks nor demand obligations,” Kala said.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German team, in the framework of which the legislation concerning public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started to carry out about two years ago.
Put simply: European legislation regulates how public tenders should be organised, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and then the praxis itself.
We have united everything and, although the control is not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "more strict and more complete", however, the concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think the conclusions are?
Precisely a common control of this kind could help us to stop investing in the implementation of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The savings economy means getting a suitable thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But it is not because of the fact that we are going to reduce the limit of the awards that we are going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much “paper”, that those who want to look for faults in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation that regulates the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NK or is it organized in another way?
As for the offices, such as the NK-, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors) operates there, with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in your case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also somewhat analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of account are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we here call state funds.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
Generally, I would not like to draw up a comparison without concrete data, but Germany is still a model in some respects, but it cannot be precise on what is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
Of course not, but, I repeat, I don’t like to make these kinds of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If not, it would be no benefit to them to collaborate with our office, wouldn't you?
As for the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean to your Office?
Considering that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been expressed in the monitoring actions.
Since we carry out ex post checks, we need to have a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public tenders, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and the like.
Do you consider the passage of this law beneficial or, rather, a scam for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under the previous regulations, the controlled persons were bound to the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law not respected in the field of public procurement meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this journey begins.
The prime minister has recently declared that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called ?varc system, referring to the fact of being autonomous only on paper.
Is the "varc" system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the Prime Minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such controls and demand obligations.
You can say, “We change the law and we allow it,” but you can’t say we’ll do it like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how to act formally, and this is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate with the best offer for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice sheets, although they are mostly walkable.
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most routes are walkable, in some cases extreme caution should be exercised.
Region of Karlovy Vary
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were walkable, but had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will range between five and ten degrees below freezing. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region’s road operations control center.
The R6 expressway and the top-notch road in the region are now unrestrictedly passable.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
Also passable are all second and third category roads, including mountain roads.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with remnants of ice and staggered snow.
Attention must be increased on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports the Directorate of roads and highways on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frosts can occur in the vicinity of Lanokrouna, ?stí nad Orlicí, Polioky, Svitav or Vysokého M?ta, and especially on second and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains of Krkonoe to Orlické hour.
There is a layer of staggered snow on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn?nou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemia area, the sky will be clear and partly cloudy today, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will usually oscillate between three below zero and a positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Region of Pilsen
Roads in the Pilsen region are passable today in the morning, although extreme caution should be exercised and adaptation to time will be necessary.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads could also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will progressively improve.
This is what emerges from the information of the road operations control center of the region.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most top-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the road to Pilsen and Tachov bordering Germany there may be stretches with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case, they are also warned of stretches with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the less busy roads in the Umava area.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of ?ervenohorské and on the road towards Videlsk? k?.
Highway operators removed snow at night; about three centimeters of snow was accumulated on the road at Umper, according to the highway administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are unrestricted.
"In the highest areas of the ?umper road, there are snow remains.
Drivers in the port of ?ervenohorské will find half-snow thrown in the direction of Jeseník," an operator of the ?umper road administration told the ?TK.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also went to the Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road, the roads are unrestricted, while on the Aternberská road, drivers should drive with caution on forest sections, where the roads are still moist.
Ostí nad Labem region and Liberec region
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications on different stretches early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ostí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures remain below freezing, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the roadway, but in the lowest areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been recorded.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surrounding area.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from the general roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the region of Istí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the track with the weight of snow.
Imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many other alarmist news stories that we like to catch.
The Tap Tap music group likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
This is a state charity that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar enunciated for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, on December 20th at 9pm, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific Ocean island of Kiribati, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, canceled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can it be heard at benefit concerts?
Of course, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn’t end...
All performers will sing it at the same time in all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomas Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the videoclip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, besides organizing many charitable events and concerts...
We are committed to participating in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested in and have fun working with us.
What will the money raised in the concerts against the end of the world be used for?
A facility for the Studeo barrier-free educational center, which we completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedli?k?v ustav.
The students of the school of Jedlykovsky Ustav are regularly visited by teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedli?k?v ustav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert there are several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji? Such?.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar “spectacular action” planned in the future?
In May we will be performing for the first time at the Prasské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as hard as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
So far, however, we have managed well. SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which still surprises me.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that in the east there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still uncommon for a person to move around the city center alone in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created that strives to thematicize the problems of people with disabilities.
In what areas should we take an example from more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a severe disability to travel on their own in public and be able to go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want to go.
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap let’s go a little further!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, it will begin to change everything for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if you look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedli?k?v ustav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Lá?a Angelovi? says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity didn’t come until these last few years, or am I wrong?
It’s true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that work that is not seen is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also afford quality teaching, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that you can do something else.
The entertainment world is full of things that resemble each other.
Logically, in its own way, everything new is accepted with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and from whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it’s not just an advance for them, but for the whole society.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss help, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many ways and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they find out they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something done.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
There is only one: Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava, and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate.
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to jointly sing The Tap Tap's song "End of the World, Cancelled"
The objective of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance the multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational center in Jedli?k?v ustav in Prague, which costs 25 million Czech crowns.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entry to the pre-sale option on Bohemiaticket
Poland and the Cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week Poland was accepted as a twelfth member of ESA. It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency’s project commission.
However, Poland’s path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the attendees indifferent, and years later, Sternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, he won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prizes in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world, and his contribution to science was rewarded when it was named after one of the craters on the moon's hidden face.
Already in 1925 a drain was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who the author of the proposal was and the details of the project are not known.
It is unclear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresin or for its braking.
The information about this dress is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 Polish artillery began to engage in missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by the engineer Rohozi?ski appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitee Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile engineering projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine first references society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
One of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) had aspired to become part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Beginning in 1956, the PTA was significantly involved in the development of the rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket on which scientific research was conducted.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg of weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 air tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets were started in the Bódów Desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the available space for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aerial Institute, the first air tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Later, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the research of space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labor cost (wages) causes economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to this end "causes a drop" in the price of the competitor in order to take over most of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
Large-scale means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and therefore is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
All this leads to the total disinterest of businessmen in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damages they have caused in their pursuit of profits.
The situation is universally so well known that it is not necessary to present concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own people regardless of social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees to labour rights.
The result is increasing poverty along with increasing differences between rich and poor.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points for poor people in Germany that cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of assistance is now 1 million.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: employees with such a low salary that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social status, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to live ill on a terrible salary on the edge of society, in the hope that one day private investor capital will reach the country.
Do you have to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the fullest that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its selfishness in the political march and, therefore, in the entire state.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission the drafting of bills to private legal companies, which are often linked to industry.
These types of bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation such as that described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for some time and the administrations occupied themselves by force".
In exchange for bribes, illegitimate favors and help to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread without any hindrance and the people went to the polls with the vote applauded beforehand"... "There were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be seriously talked about that the only remedy for such a serious situation was to autocracy.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today’s society is based on disregarded preferences for individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, capable of understanding and reclaiming the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without any effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal-style democracy, as a definite pause, waiting for the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the hundreds of thousands of lives lost, social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and more recent history.
The suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long run.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution lies in concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"That Nothing Comes from Violence and Nothing Ever Could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads "Let's Do Not Forget How Fragile We Are".
“If my children didn’t want wars, there would be none,” Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, said on his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on Israel’s side, argues for the right of self-defense and frames Palestinians in the role of terrorists, the other supports Palestinians and claims racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and brands Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the periodic killings and who is the victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not live through the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a behind-the-scenes look, a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have been creeping away for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour statement in November 1917) on a small surface of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached based on my own understanding of the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
In every age we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who oriented their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this entails has not been possible in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschilds’ central bank’s status, began during the American Civil War to print money, and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their yearning for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third aimed at reducing the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism before such a definitive solution).
The method by which the group of the richest families operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the crisis trigger and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao – order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the Fed was created so that a crisis like the one of 1907 does not repeat itself.
So, after the successful assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian heir to the throne, Francis Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after the First World War broke out, they shattered Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended suddenly and unjustified from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, covertly, a situation of conflict in the wake of the enormous reparations of war imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know if Hitler pulled too much from the rope to which the international bankers had tied him at first or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If international bankers managed to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim on the front line of combat, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how Israel's sympathizers and detractors are sharply divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning there was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes 20% of the world’s oil supply alone.
In what light are David Rockefeller’s 1994 words now displayed: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order.”
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
And it forces everyone, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they carry the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, let him add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo Movie: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist students held the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: throwing the shah overboard could not afford it, as if it did, it would endanger the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within his grasp.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's intervention in negotiations.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and encouragement against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck thematicizes an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a difficult journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for this helped a covert story an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew examining the location in the country for the shooting of a sci-fi overproduction.
Combination of genres
The plan drawn up by “exfiltration” expert Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a singular combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
On the one hand, we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are shown emblematic photographs of the era of events, which were shaped in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: costumed men analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is her third feature film, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it’s Affleck’s first film in which the action doesn’t take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran “wheels” in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events. The introductory sequence of the embassy takeover is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And it does quite well. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here everything doesn’t go so elegantly (the scene where the crisis looms at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its track become madness).
The weakness of Argo is the out of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s film loses a bit of a dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, appreciating its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But if it collapses, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflation of balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the EU workshop".
“It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in senior management positions in large European companies,” said Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey’s organizer.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women were taking advantage of better prices in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by people until the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline obscures the size of the cage of chickens, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual ban on using the term "buttermilk" or the removal of the classic light bulb from stores has been criticized.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under pressure from one or another trade or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself saying that with this it only seeks to harmonize national rules that have not been homogenized to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of groceries.
The candidate to win the survey could be last year’s EU prescription that in inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU was referring here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of child death from suffocation.
A similar restriction is also in place for children up to the age of 14.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, one must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, named in the survey, among some of the absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union’s prescription on the volume of food supplies on the territory of a member state.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
Afterwards, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volume for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fines.
The survey organizers were also interested in paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the grant application.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
“We’re at a disadvantage because we don’t have a sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation,” declared then-Agricultural Minister Jaroslav Palas (SSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that in our country a lot of cereal was produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereal from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Näämec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of grant applications from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often the target of criticism, the EU's efforts in the field of regulations and, moreover, more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which the member states have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs, as well as other countries in the Union, are also affected by the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even though our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the appellation of origin of the Olomouc cheese, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the nineteenth century, and became called "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known all over the world, the marzipan of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, are already found for example the biscuits of Karlovy Vary, the tent of Poho-elice and the tent.
As protected maras of the EU, you will be able to be proud of the gingerbread of Pardubice and the boats of Ho?ice v Podkrkono?.
People want me to save the republic, but I’m an amateur, Okamura says
Senator, how did you come up with running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or a president.
If everything was fine in our country, then I would not submit my candidacy.
But I can no longer stand to see theft in our country over the past twenty years, thieves going unpunished, taxes going up and retirement age going up.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I’m forty and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has made its way to the presidency.
Isn’t he turning his back on those who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for president depended on the results in the Senate elections.
I later specified that if I were elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and the strongest mandate possible.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize at the bar or in front of television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to initiate change.
This is added to the media, which discredits you and confuses freedom of expression with freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an adviser to Ji? Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over twenty million.
To do this, the law must be changed.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobby group to make the guiding profession recognized as self-employment, and we got it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, either from the right or from the left, he is deliberately rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
“Without party dogmas or caucuses, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is he a man of the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn’t matter to me, whether it’s a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we move forward.
I don’t care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSOM or the SDG and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
It's a joke when you say you're a populist.
But isn't he proving it with what he says?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get closer to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already working in the world or well-known experts are talking about them.
But without the support of parliament, only slogans remain.
It cannot survive in the long term.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to get it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live broadcast on television in which he would ask parliamentary party leaders to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they didn’t want to.
If there is a strong character who points to disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Take for example the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say that I’m just an amateur, I’m neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I’ve just started in politics and I’m trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to move things forward myself, but in case it doesn’t go well, in six years I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know I don’t do anything with a person, that’s why I’ve visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light the frauds with light heating oils.
I presented myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I am in the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted to the establishment representatives.
In the Senate, we are both from the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time for it, to check the flawless past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign, my transparent account has only 20,000 crowns.
You don't have any money?
Talk about property statements, how's yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
He drives an Aston Martin, his property is valued at $60 million and he has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don’t want to put too much money on your part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there isn’t too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money out of my pocket.
Campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a senator’s salary.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, I couldn't pay my son for English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't be running for president.
So you're going to keep your business going so you can live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I have promised, I have partly left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in spring.
The people would want him to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep winning.
If I were president, I would quit business.

The architectural studio MVRDV proves that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly finished "mountain of books"- 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing by.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "Moreover, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
No one likes to go into those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town on the outskirts of Rotterdam that barely deserves a short visit, boasts the dubious honor of having set a record for forgetting.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this embarrassing situation, some years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how policymakers decided that there was only one way to improve statistics: you had to build a library!
Winy Maas, of Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, a master of the art of bar charts and responsible for fun buildings as well as cynics, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size into a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here is my proposal for Spijkenisse’s mountain of books, the so-called Boekenberg.”
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain rises to its intended place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and townhouse buildings.
At the beginning of November the mountain of books was awarded with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town without history, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy farm, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to the book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheeseburger.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography every step of its climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to embrace with the view, the annealed brick floor and elegant streetlights unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up, you can see the park benches, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally bookcases are arranged along the façade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is put the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
Sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most everyday architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that’s how one day, on a Friesian farm, we stumble upon the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years now, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a thin plastic fabric has been used as a base for holding crop roots.
It is an inexpensive and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to obtain plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mix of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment while maintaining adequate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
“Although it’s hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology,” says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Even though the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden enclosures located transversely to the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is about automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Likewise, Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, has visited the library, calling the Boekenberg the Spijkenisse’s “late soul.”
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
This way it is intended, for the moment, to fill the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its full archive; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV studio has achieved great success in that reigning discipline that in specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated you are.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more protagonist role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany implied that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status of the United Nations.
Eventually, however, Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because at the moment he is reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they’re still teasing what their role will be, but they’ve already started the road to a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other great powers, and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken regarding the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason she must be careful and not alienate herself from Arab public opinion or Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn’t give it that much importance because it’s not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by refraining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic breakup as in the case of Libya.
Germany may have earned a certain amount of respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly expressed its support for a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the U.S. and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great deal of understanding towards the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend this position.
I believe that the true disparity of opinion does not really have the magnitude attributed to it.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that’s exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher being, but they must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing with the euro now.
I believe that in the future Germany will assume a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a dangerous topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see herself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or maybe you still find it hard to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always a bit uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still struggles to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
U.S. influence in European politics is waning more and more, but the EU isn’t covering that gap right now, so who’s left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more protagonist role.
Even if they don’t like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, it’s life!

Brand protection in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a globally known brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they are going to be given the reason.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens an archive in which she keeps seats from the Beijing trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are large warehouses of several floors dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are of a different kind, and on behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a denomination that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have “fished” a rich man.
Chinese authorities don’t feel guilty
“It’s detrimental to the business, you have to fight it,” Pattloch demands.
“The brand makes waters, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous.”
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are millions, especially in the case of iconic luxury products.
According to market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year, China is, in size, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of doubtful legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can last up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long that the name object of the lawsuit had already become a "market reality".
“If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarizer because the process has damaged his brand in China,” Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why today the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely initially used a blue-and-white logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
Clothing maker Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile looking in the opposite direction from the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they had difficulties due to shortages of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the work emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed claims processes has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money.
As is usual in China, the numbers are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means China is leading the list of new entries worldwide for the 10th year in a row, according to the trademark office.
This also seems to be the case with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in entitlements would have been collected.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting against this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese impersonator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
The imitator has secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“We ourselves have provoked this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected,” said Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the Munich appeal.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opposing side is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the Superior Court of Justice, where it remains pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident in being able to resolve the issue favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a “six-figure sum in euros” with the aim of reaching a friendly deal, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe.
Specifically, if imitators secure there the rights to unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since abandoned this commercial field, yet managed to prevent registration.
“You have to be very careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is "register everything that may be susceptible to protection in China", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, should Freudenberg lose the last round of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees in his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would kick us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: dancing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a link capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and loafers look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the singers’ voices (alt, bass, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise, swirling, numbing and following one another.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his box by trying to put order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty singers between the ages of 23 and 69 have also arrived, from the human geneticist to the homeowner.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and also in a little-known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to fight AIDS, there are approximately 34 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found godparents in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Estjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "panegirist".
In this room no one can speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
8,733 kilometers away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esijeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in their 30s has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but also the main things: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the chances in a poor country are more than slim.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day, all for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since professionally dealt with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Clams and scabies are among parasite-borne STDs.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more often in men who have sex with other men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively rare; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were recorded in 2011.
This is one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort with urination, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don’t offer 100% protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through soil and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend undergoing regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change your sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir charges for their performances throughout Germany, they get to raise a lot of money.
“In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Estjeni,” said Annette Lennartz, the association’s president, proudly.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini a self-confident woman with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
He makes sure that the orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as the older women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof to live in and take care of the children to attend school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has started a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is evident throughout the country, it is not usually talked about openly.
A King with 14 Wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficially accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the innumerable temporary residents who travel the country from one side to the other and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two to three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost extremity of the African continent still remember from the era of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a language of blacks; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to tear out a couple of angry border soldiers.
The trip always takes them to Esijeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population barely appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is well known.
“Come to Esijeni, there the light shines,” the locals say.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal halls of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the way, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also ice water, as evidenced by three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reportedly found evidence that the permanently shadowed area of the planet has formed an ice sheet.
It seems that it is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, with great probability, asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says lead researcher Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: tiny windows into the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no “planet.”
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which endless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantically named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This solitary image of an endangered star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galaxy’s star-forming zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, the colors can be better appreciated with the telescope.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This budding star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It’s probably the remains of one of Saturn’s moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs ever taken by the Hubble Telescope: the Whirlwind Galaxy.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), as dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth the nuclei of two merging galaxies rock towards each other to end up colliding irretrievably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it as Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light-years away is made up of dust particles that are between ten and a hundred times smaller than the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and x-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars also continuously emerge; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen was mostly found in the universe.
Our Window to the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the Large Binocular Telescope is being built.
This allows us to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer by providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
It is not expected to be able to take pictures until 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which next to them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Mauna Kea is expected to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of what it would be like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been sending pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of its mission, 1,235 planet candidates had been located.
The image shows the latest preparations for the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for light from the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers assume that there is ice at Mercury’s south pole as well.
However, there is no strong evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that it is.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years

In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus proceeds with great thunder through the winding road that passes next to forested hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of the local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it’s in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "Talyshi", a people of which not much is known, apart from that they perfectly dominate Persian and Azeri and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts a perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit completely into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely reach this place, as the road from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, turns out to be too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate the two urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this hidden region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will be celebrating the World’s Oldest People Festival,” says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis of the place who have surpassed 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136.
The museum’s undisputed star, however, is sheepherder Oirali Müslümov, who appears to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate to certify it.
And if we take into account that the older documented man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
“He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Have you, then, been wrong about your age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
“In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, very elderly people also live,” Scholz says, “even in Sardinia there are many older men.”
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil record either.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly frequently, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the South?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in the diet.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, he is relatively young for what he stands out for in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
They also play two small children from one side to the other.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that they serve in typical cups with a vaulted shape.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the scarf she hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son discovers us proudly.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen out and has kept its color.
“I’ve never used a shampoo either,” says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
He has always only eaten what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I’ve never been to a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything came back to its feet when the “dear father,” Heydar Aliyev, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult that is professed to the father figure of the nation, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when he ceded the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s canoeous son is right: “in our culture the elderly are highly respected.”
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The term "human rights" is missing in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Protests that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is mired.
The future constitution, with Sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in patheticism.
“We need to overcome the transition.
And that that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, hitherto hopelessly plunged into a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost apologizing, he has had to temporarily override the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend his powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world knows very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour nightly meeting, are truly worrisome.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does that mean for “principles”?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal room it has set up, to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This is at least what a new article added suggests: in all matters relating to sharia, it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to be that way, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak’s dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
After the dictator’s downfall, as many as 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As stated in the draft, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
It is so inaccurate in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly speaking, this is nothing more than censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
It is forbidden to offend or slander the Prophet Muhammad and his legacies.
However, it is unclear what an offense is and how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording that forbids “offending people.”
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for signature and that according to, his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
For weeks, the opposition has been closing ranks in the face of Islamists’ superiority.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in the Tahrir del Cario square and swore to fail the Act before it could go into effect.
“The revolution is back and we will end up winning,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who occupies third place on the presidential election lists.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution should be “in the trash can of history.”
He accused Mursi’s followers of wanting to lead a “coup against democracy.”
“When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for,” Egypt’s opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted as saying in Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration, perhaps not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer across the Nile at Cairo University.
Many women covered in a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it to the cry: "the people demand the application of divine law."
They demanded that Mursi “cleanse the country,” while proclaiming, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi’s supporters did not want to risk anything like this.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who opposed the draft constitution and those who supported it would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would be the time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should take.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamists’ draft is guaranteed the majority.
“The term ‘human rights’ doesn’t even appear.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced trial during Mubarak’s dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
“And now the expression ‘Human Rights’ doesn’t even appear in the new constitution,” he laments in a conversation with the newspaper “Welt am Sonntag.”
The extension of Morsi’s powers to the three state powers caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “You’re conceiving a monster that you can’t control.”
The Norwegian rakfisk: the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country bears any relation to its craving for a highly smelly fish?
Take a series of overly cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You will then be able to smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of the delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is allowed to ferment in water for up to a year, depending on how smelly you prefer.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating delicacy.
“You eat raw and then drink a glass of aquavit from a drink,” says Havard Halvarsen, a city fireman who is also known as the “General of Rakfisk,” who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a drink significant amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” Havard says.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it close to your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not unlike a portion of sushi that’s traveled a few miles by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, when poverty plagued Norway and before there was refrigeration, fish was stored during the fall immersed in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the senses inactive due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of people from Sweden, the old rival and even not too much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered an important, essential, but rather smelly part of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes that can be purchased.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you a whopping 10€ ($14) each.
Norway doesn’t usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like that.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the July 22 event.”
It is very difficult for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own could commit such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway’s current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she goes past rakfisk trays and which, with its long blonde mane and striking blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, wise people.”
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; everything except a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn’t have during the years leading up to the worldwide financial crisis, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with an unwrapped load.
I’m in the snow queuing to eat something; I’ve had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, that smelly fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held in which the diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A TV has connected live with a birdie-wearing presenter who is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapours of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico’s incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant looks at the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad right now.
In a city that, under the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and that is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will host the presidential band and take over the nation.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been doing well during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My administration has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Mr. Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Before coordinating with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña’s previous political experience was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
A highly populated and fast-growing state, surrounding the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents credit it with the growth of on-site tourism and infrastructure construction.
To get to the city you can drive along one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked roads and full of bumps that have been rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with his name at the entrance of a modern sports hall and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he can make real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a deputy for Mr. Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
“Particularly, when it comes to security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was overthrown by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition’s rating of the new president’s lack of essence.
“He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic statesman and, above all, he’s a person who knows how to listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden beneath elevated stretches of highway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also harsh and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was asked to help fight neighborhood drug gangs and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a far higher rate than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
Most critics accuse their administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorating neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body had been cleaned,” recalls Mrs. Buendía.
“There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared.”
As her mother recounts the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross in which she reads a single word: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family says he’s been denied.
“State authorities have treated me like I was a gossipy old woman, a troublemaker, a grievance.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shuts up.”
“But that can’t be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has pledged to prioritize them during his tenure.
“I hope he’s the same kind of president he was when he was governor,” says PRI Olvera’s deputy in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning during his time in prison
The trial focuses on Manning’s time at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning’s incarceration was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecution’s interrogation of Manning at a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein said that records of weekly visits by officers of the unit Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment he was receiving.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence's request that the case be dismissed given that his imprisonment had been harsh and that it had already entailed sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday’s hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was held in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and written down his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had rated the caretaker’s treatment as “excellent” and the treatment he received at the facility as a whole as “very professional.”
The forms show no allegations of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that officials visiting him had discussed those issues and indicated that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues on the record.
“They wrote ‘no incidents’ (after I’ve talked about the issues) but that doesn’t necessarily mean I wouldn’t have mentioned any problems,” Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment he received during the January 2011 meeting with a council tasked with examining the suicide intentions he had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the “injury prevention” regime under which he was.
The military said it had been placed under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below that of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure its protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was fine and to stop being under injury prevention... so they could enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning said Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in that cage.”
Manning claimed that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming from outside pointing at his eyes as he slept.
He said that if the caretakers couldn’t see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday’s statement that, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of jailers and other inmates.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge’s interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order given to him by the jailer that he should drop the blanket with which he could have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used the rubber band of his underwear or his slippers to injure himself but had not.
Manning testified that night his underwear, flip flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers are hopeful that the judge will at least take into account his experiences during his time in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted on the war council, which is scheduled to start early next year.
The defense said it planned to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanors and defend other allegations deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was held in accordance with the rules of application to any detainees who are in maximum custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally posting information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans find themselves trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely gotten down the esplanade and arrived in the immigration processing zone and was already totally confused.
Posters pointed the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners."
I stayed there for a few seconds not sure where I should go.
Having grown up in Central California, I’ve been called “Mexican” all my life.
It’s ethnic shorthand, the same way my friends in Boston refer to themselves as “Irish” or my friends in New York call themselves “Italians.”
I later decided on “Mexican-American.”
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the level of vocabulary of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and got in the queue of foreigners.
I thought of that moment this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why a Mexican is as likely to stay in Mexico as he is to venture to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory to pistol tip.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So the moment a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma stand up at war.
And yet, for Mexico, the truly challenging relationship is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, somewhere on our family tree, there was one person, perhaps the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Mexico not.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living, the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may be unclear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the ruling class elite do not like it.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us over the shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is this tension between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of either.
We love to hear the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
They see us in Mexico as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate things, from what I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised “ambassadors” of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American comrades how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much grudge.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be alone with this idea, friends.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unprepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated far less time ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything to pieces whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this makes their struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there is reason to think that their deadly deadlock could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on Nov. 21 is maintained, this week’s clashes have reinforced hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on Gaza’s 1.7 million inhabitants in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the planet, Israel has failed to wipe out Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time is playing in their favor.
As Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s wealthiest and most dynamic states.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia party dominates, to Syria, where increasingly Islamist rebels could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood is a cousin to Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more peacefully... for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly thanks to the barrier that erodes the West Bank, the main piece of territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase even though, under international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why pamper those Palestinian twisted people by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab spring could alter their calculations.
Even if Islamists who seize power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two to three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one advocated by sensible people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel’s cession of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the people of others who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must start curbing the entry of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs foreign to the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to it.
This is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The Tobacco Packaging Act comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and diseased body parts appear on green-coloured out-of-boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia’s pioneering tobacco and generic packaging law comes into force and replaces logos and brand colors with a wrapper of olive green, gruesome images of diseased body parts and depictions of children and babies sick from being children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and sanitary warnings, the only difference between the cartridges, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all printed in a small font type.
This is the world’s strictest regime for tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
She relies on studies that show that if a person hasn’t started smoking before age 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never do so.
“You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes won’t affect multinationals’ profits too much, other countries are considering taking similar action.
The tobacco industry has put enormous pressure on the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the tobacco black market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say their business has benefited from passing the law.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, said the lawsuit for flasks and silicone covers to cover the nasty images from the cartridges had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a lawsuit in Australia's Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha claimed that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was expecting more stocks.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographics to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned online advertising to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign websites.
“If you market tobacco and just have this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from “walking citizens” posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
You might wonder if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble of making a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is more focused on what the new regulations entail than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being restricted unfairly, even though none of these countries has significant trade volume with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the requirement to include images in the cartridges.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are defiant.
“Photographs don’t affect me.
I just don’t listen to them.”
“Take the cigar and save the package,” Victor El Hage says as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
“Honestly, there’s only one reason I would quit smoking: for my daughter.”
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, says uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to place them on the shelves.
“Normally it took an hour to unravel a delivery; now it takes four,” Yu says.
“The government should have banned tobacco altogether and then, it’s okay, it’s over and we’re closing the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get a little bored.
During this year’s Thanksgiving celebrations, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But more and more academics and child development experts are praising the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it’s okay for us and our children to get bored from time to time.
Being bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and may foster creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we don’t experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we willingly accept boredom?
Yeah.
And no.
But, we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press states, it is not.
“In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin on the boredom dating from the first century A.D.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and presenting the idea to a 100-strong discussion group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “desiring, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you.”
He says the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person doesn’t do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that while they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be their own.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a journal article.
Some groups heard in the adjoining room a full-volume TV show that kept no relationship, others heard it with low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the show with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they struggled to concentrate, but weren’t sure why and blamed it on boredom.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, attentional disturbance can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like detecting defective parts in a manufacturing line, music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving around or making scribbles, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it as they make that person physically more alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, an especially boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a “boring trend scale.”
The scale includes issues like “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But what he did know was that “adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest levels,” largely because both children and teens aren’t given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into substance use as a method to combat it, as evidenced by research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“ Boredom is the brain’s way of telling you you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may no longer be bored, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or dose himself,” says Professor Fenske.
And “that ability to be dosed applies to other situations,” he points out.
Your child not only learns to entertain themselves, but learns to control themselves better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of him either.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get more bored, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to relate to something worthwhile,” he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Use Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and footballer from southeast Colorado, is facing criminal prosecution over something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of some marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by police.
Police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (minor offenses each carrying a US$100 fine) informing him of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes for drug possession depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana possession offenses are being overturned both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have dropped charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be passed legally once the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s more conservative district attorneys have pledged to move forward with cases opened for marijuana possession and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent recently licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This is all changing so quickly that I don’t know what’s next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in Washington state are also turning the issue around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licenses – all before the deadline, December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that will serve as a model,” he says.
Washington’s law, called I-502, comes into force on Dec. 6, which also leaves a year in which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to provide “adequate access” to authorized marijuana and its prohibition to conduct cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 meters of schools, parks, children’s playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be harder to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On November 21, Oates, Aurora’s chief of police, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city’s prosecutor would stop bringing lawsuits for minor marijuana possession offenses against people over the age of 21 and that police would stop bringing charges against those offenses “with immediate effect.”
Police chief Oates said they would be in charge of enforcing the city’s regulations governing the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to prosecute drug dealers and sellers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, primarily to pressure consumers to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those offenses that at the time they occurred were criminal offenses,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Grand Junction police, the county’s largest city, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported the decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
“I don’t consider that I’m wasting time in continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Even though 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and the judiciary would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier to the district attorneys,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the marijuana possession defendants and who is a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
“They’ve spent so much time taking people to court that, in fact, they still can’t accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become nationwide test cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving guidance from the federal government, which still envisages considering the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization are hopeful that the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
“Although anti-drug agents are likely not to pull doors down to confiscate a small bag of drugs, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to operate for the sale of recreational marijuana, allowed under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy advisor to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments have approved moratoria on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We’re studying in favor of what the community voted for versus voting in favor of what the state voted for.”
There are a lot of questions about it.
Petronella Wyatt: “I was harassed to the point of being kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory”
College students aren’t attacked for their views just now.
I don’t remember any time in my life when I wasn’t dreaming of getting a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I thought was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary-era Greek symposium that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue a career in history, I had already packed my bags, triggering the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had dropped out because I didn’t tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had left because I was forced to drink in cracked cups.
The truth was less fun.
I got out of there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, that in the cradle of the supposed illustration it was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering what that's coming to now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-wing students are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards conservative students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s JCR say they are “often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated like non-grateful people” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their college’s Equal Opportunity Committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and portraying the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
He showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with the silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as “Turkish heads” by introducing higher tuition rates.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice president of the University of Nottingham’s Conservative Party Association, said in a Sunday paper that “there is a growing trend of the left in universities.
People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is “uncomfortable,” while Stephanie Cherill, a 19-year-old OUCA president-elect, says the JCR’s attitude toward people who are center-right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment as well as the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary title following cuts in funding for Higher Education.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder.
Already during the first few days of the new college welcome week, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that the professors not only made a blind eye to the mockery of conservative college students, but willingly participated in it.
The policy of the miners’ strike, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the seminary’s wooden halls.
The first one I attended had to translate 18th-century French texts into English, and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Not a single one.
Pitt, a small man with a face that looked like cake mass, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Is it that Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just fools?" he asked.
The other college students laughed.
My eyes were burning with the tears I was trying to contain.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt grunted.
I went back to my room like a soul in sorrow.
That night I sat alone at dinner time in college; then I felt a slight pat on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newcomers to Tories appear to be Labour.”
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to cover up.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick proved useless.
A freshman student of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: “You’re the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated.”
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
“How do the Tories have sex?” asked one.
“They beat each other up, didn’t they?”
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me only after dark?
Should I become a Labourer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
He was hated for being not only a Conservative, but also Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he said.
I started moving daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded family and friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But if it’s the best place in the world,” he said sadly.
“They would never do that, not there between my beloved dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude.”
Her aching eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would break if you let it."
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional endurance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another Professor of History had insinuated, quite seriously, that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Red with embarrassment inside, I admitted that my parents had “washed my brain” and called them “stupid old men.”
The truce was short-lived.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At the time, my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch’s press.
My door was locked.
I was curled up in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bag and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party but, today, hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", a retrospective apotheosis that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "the gentleman" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are plenty of private letters and photos with the signature of the most pomegranate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from the humble modesty of the northern Italian city of Voghera to the idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty is not a bad thing.
“At least they don’t turn off the glues of their nipples on your gorgeous carpet like some beautiful celebrities in pop music do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved being invited to his cottage in Gstaad,” explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, an intimate of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
Argentinian model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
There were 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, everything was seen and felt its spirit.
“Every guest made us feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model,” which began working with him during Paris Haute Couture Week in 1995.
“It never goes out of fashion because their designs are works of art,” he says.
Parade of Alcurnia
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-requited loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk of sixty meters long that used a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the catwalk to contemplate a "audience" of dream that wears masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle the Vestle.
In this audience of mannequins shine names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modisto, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the Fall-Winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty,” adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and they are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed a Valentine either.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of becoming the age and the opportunity to be able to wear one of his nightwear...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a flared skirt, draped "corsage" and a word of honor neckline.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dresses from the dressmaker with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that it carries."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House’s exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding suit at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the dressmaker calls their seamstresses) to craft this ivory-colored silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different lace types and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the haute couture of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the clients of high society."
Obsessed for years with the savoir-être of the elite, Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“I have always been struck by his refinement, his calmness, his fluffy and perfect appearance,” admits D’Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
“It was impeccable, time doesn’t pass for him.”
If a princess says so...
The World's Hardest Craft: The Human Mules by Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living taking sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to descend every day to the bottom of his crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies upon coming into contact with the air.
After plucking large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two baskets of bamboo that he carries on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
They are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters above sea level, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb at turtle’s pace, keeping their balance and tentatively measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the precipice.
They know that any trespass could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago at the risk of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur they extract
Once up, they make their way among tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, strenuously loading the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilo of sulfur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
“As normal is to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” explains Anto, who usually carries three daily doors.
It takes three hours in each and ends up ground, but they allow you to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such an inhuman effort, it is three times as much as I would earn on the field.
“The miners’ newspaper is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the tajo was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as forceful as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java with Islam so that she can take her to Java."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing three skins on the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already started to pass through his face despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, he coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
That’s the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a hotel tour guide, waiter or receptionist, but instead does the job of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden cabin with other porters, he gets up every day at two o’clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends to the crater lighting himself with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers carry sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its heavy profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and at the same time the weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of camera surcharge that, along with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for the beasts and not for the people,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old brazen carrier who has been at the Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, she says she will endure working “as much as she can” because she needs the money to educate her three children, aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and sniffs the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... beyond, of course, their usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, knee pains and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the cesare.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his comrades pluck 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away along a goat road through the weeds.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth well, where he is missing several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the toughest trades in the world: the one made by the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and the cost of property and education for not having children.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we do our civic duty and we create life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a peppermint pill ad, but despite that – or maybe because of that – the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (bubble) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hoping that with the ad they will manage to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill “their national duty.”
This is purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt this was a topic we had to address.
We knew the government had tried a lot of things, like throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do as creatively as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn’t take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as the replenishment rate – was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies at the National Population Division, says it’s due to “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing singleness, and delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, whom they criticize for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved on to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there are concerns that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family-friendly homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate firm EL Developers, says their “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units sell out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district doesn’t seem to have much effect.
“People are very stressed out, homes are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it,” says one young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
Private offline is private online
Privacy.
According to the Diccionario de la Real Academia Española it is about the quality of private or "the area of private life that you have the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child under 16?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by venting on the Internet situations that you would surely not share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with “something very personal” and “in the user’s password and name” when applied to social media.
“My deepest secrets wouldn’t go up to a post,” says Jorge, 10, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“They’re very secret secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone,” she says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a picture that isn’t mine, or someone who’s making a fool of themselves,” he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene, nude, crime photographs or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just upload them,” he adds.
“Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” she says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Nor would he listen to anyone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14, is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in which the latter admits not to meet 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
“I’m not scared, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has insinuated or asked for his home address or phone number.
“If I were pressured or required to do so, I would simply take them out of my account,” he admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“I never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
“It just gave you privacy.”
Then explain a number of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I like it badly or I feel like it.
“Although I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites they changed the rules of the game,” he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master’s degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the issue is complex, “because we’re asking them to have a definite judgement on what it’s worth or not to spread, publish or say at an age that maturity doesn’t give for that.”
“They’re also selective when what they care about most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences.”
The most effective way to teach children and teens what privacy is is through thought-provoking questions.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to be posted a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, everyone needs to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
“An outsider acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same must be on social media,” he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, elementary teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents read social media policies carefully.
By understanding each of the paragraphs they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of “don’t talk to strangers.”
UNASUR Summit ends without making the Lima Declaration public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the Declaration of Lima, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending presidents, being made public.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency initially indicated that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but later stated that at some point it will be published on the Peruvian government website.
When consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
Journalists’ access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by press spokespersons from some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it is Humala’s pronouncement, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South America-Arab Countries Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently demanded by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not broadcast.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that transmission systems were insured for all journalists but limited the collection of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will abide by and execute the sentence that defines the differences we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts,” Piñera added, handshaking Humala alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogotá Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international court, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the inconsistencies of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the residency agreements."
He said actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-cost internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transversal axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
Also, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for his reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace, and for good neighbourly relations, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to deal respectfully with the maritime dispute following a ruling by the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“We are going to review all these roads, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua,” he said.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him to handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega would meet Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of that country’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defense ministers previously met to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told state-run TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He defended, in that sense, the project of establishing South American citizenship encouraged by Unasur member countries.
“We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also expressed support for the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose Pact on human rights.
Those who give chairs never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said in reference to Ecuador’s political asylum given to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he is not sorry for that decision because he has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep democratic and human rights values".
He added that, at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish court for requiring him to be interrogated on his territory for an alleged sexual offense when "swedish law itself allows it to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there is a risk of Assange's physical and mental health deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," he said.
What does exist is the danger of your physical and mental health deteriorating by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
“That complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa said the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting him a bailout allowing him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London looking for a solution to the WikiLeaks founder’s imprisonment.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances,” he said.
And he said that “if Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this is over.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said what he does not tolerate is “mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and wicked politicians but the bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, he welcomed the fact that it is no longer these journalists “neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador”, and he said that if re-elected he will “deepen into the revolution to continue the right path and direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay in Unasur until at least its next election, arguing that the body “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d’état clothed in legality” because in reality “it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.”
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly pertinent" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this failure is not accepted.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed extensively to overcome them and move forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the litigation for maritime boundaries that keep in the same court Peru and Chile and opined that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept judgment no matter how harsh."
Referring to the eventuality of running as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador’s, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that accountability,” he said.
To win would be my last term in the presidency and that’s where we come out of public life.
If we lose the same.
“It’s a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It doesn’t mean a relapse in President Chavez’s health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths are a cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: AIDS positive.
“It was as if I dropped a bomb,” he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make it “softer,” without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inquire about it; with such effort that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him “because he brought a cut.”
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
Yet, ignorant of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, “depleted” their immune system and become victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least of the first cases reported, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, noting that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affectation of the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 CDs.
Simply put, the above means that whoever is diagnosed with HIV-positive at age 25, under these terms “as long as he remains in control he will be able to live smoothly until age 75,” the interviewee explained.
To scale this advance, it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths as of May this year; however, it is assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's what I see, that's what happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medication the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, have to be offered mass screening to all people who require it.”
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida) agree, also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a particular laboratory to get tested, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi’s sarcoma, a common cancerous tumor that is one of the complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die already, I’d better bounce back three times a week,” they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone.
“I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with Milenio Jalisco to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
That they get tested, if they had a risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the battle against AIDS motto in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapatío journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packs of a hundred, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are those today, still, who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
“Why do you love them?” is a common question, with sorna and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which teenagers do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that the condoms be not only behind the counters, and that those hundred be found in public restrooms of the places frequented by the young.
It’s not about motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, when asked if there would have been a distribution of condoms in his Administration.
“That’s not sexuality, it’s best to bring condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity,” she said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV cases).
The state ranks 4th in the nation in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the bloodstream and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court a ruling unaware of the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt achieved via a mercantile tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a nefarious precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, then, that the downstream procedures for the survival of signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In practical terms, Judge Harlin Hale’s June 15 ruling of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless over the possibility of an embargo on their properties beyond El Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door for Mexico’s top glass maker to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
Incoming, while the case judge points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit appeals court, based in New Orleans, says the main proceeding is the trade show in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created, and the American Law Institute was placed as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts that the Vitro subsidiaries had with their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro’s was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway Vitro’s creditors who fought against it in the U.S. Courts, that is, the “vulture” funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 to avoid the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, hitting the collections to the country.
For now, the signature of the González Sada family will file a reconsideration appeal with the appeals court itself for the vote to reach the full vote of the five judges, since only three voted.
If this does not succeed, Cerciorare’s appeal will be claimed, requiring a review of the process by a higher body, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about the case is that the court overruled a document sent by the Mexican government under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competitions Act, noting that it was discharged with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-sided carambola: they hit Vitro and they hit the country.
General Balance Sheet
Sleeping for several months the complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación unions against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Aviation Pilots Union has already found the bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the employer to extract from the trust F/589 of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Looking for the Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and general members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with an area of housing for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental coso that ravaged some protected areas and raises the mother of all the hideouts against the industry.
The ACTA has died
Supported by the government a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been involved in basketball for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, he travelled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local basketball history as broad as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was a junior player, a National Higher Basketball player, a proxy and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I put a lot of hats on basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 90s,” Reyes recalled during a first-hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate by making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his vast trajectory, attest to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all of them, the ones he treasures most thrillingly are those who remember his time with the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old serving as a co-op or takeover of the franchise.
Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the chance to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as a proxy, co-powered or manager.
They were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy’s debut year at the BSN.
From then on, he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had run here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, “I have a very strong player, 6” 7” in stature.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gasse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gasse would help bring in another.
The Cowboys championship with Gasse enjoyed it, but already in the distance, because by 1988 it was already a federative boss.
For that time, I preferred to enjoy his executors and Mincy’s on the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Pre-Olympic in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we reached fourth place and it should have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup team the best National Team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Panamericans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a coat to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the world championship.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gasse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-playing players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the Panamericano mess of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers in international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculin did.
And that's not counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Boricua leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, that Ponce boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certifications and course for leaders, board officials and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas," in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of “Dallas,” died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producer of “Dallas.”
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he liked the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, he was found to have a malignant tumor in his liver and had a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it she played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate anticipation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risky at bookmakers.
He also helped give the series an audience record at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in to it and made “Dallas” the second most-watched entertainment show in history, behind the end of “MASH” in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who attempted to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), interned.
“I know what I want on J.R.’s gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
He should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only trade he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman Friday as someone “huge, on and off screen.”
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished recording five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was in the works, the network reported.
Immediately there was no pronouncement from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle Hagman’s loss.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had it in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York City in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything there that I thought would hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he became a promoter of organ donation and volunteered in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I value them, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like “don’t be afraid, it’ll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they’ll be fine.”
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charme decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the “long countdown” of the Mayan Calendar, December 21, to which many people have clung as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: Cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called “deudamagedon” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charme told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what has been going on in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good time.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World.”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We look at why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
“I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled “The End of the World.”
“We didn’t add ‘2012’ to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world isn’t over,” Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin,” students must study, generate projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work “until the very night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“It was saturated in two hours,” Restall said of his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, on the other hand, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people do to console themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
The apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of consolation or the absence of consolation.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he saw all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed – let alone a professor – said they believed in the December 21 expiration date.
“Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and we somehow discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, that people react to the changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
“Somewhere else people don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any courses on the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe he'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
