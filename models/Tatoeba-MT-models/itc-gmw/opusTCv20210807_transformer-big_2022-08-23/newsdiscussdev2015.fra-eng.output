It sounds like a typical rugby club.
At an English university, maybe...
It has nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But it doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that it’s common in rugby is pretty much anything.
Yes, we do not interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we do not break anyone's nose during the drinking games (well, unless it is part of the game), but we have actually painted ourselves in black for some disguised evenings.
I have never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme that said.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar commentary on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the freshman prospectus seemed quite typical to me.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt in my eyes that they go much further than the misogynistic jokes and alcohol jokes that are often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to provoke as much as possible.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But come on, why let your prejudices and stereotypes stand in the way of the facts?
I imagine the LSE rugby team is populated by alumni from these schools for whom competitive rugby is a tradition.
In other words, old boys from the private sector.
Coming from very different backgrounds than those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
Are "misogynistic jokes" acceptable?
Looks like my university rugby club, I've never seen any racist behavior, but naked running across campus, theft, property damage and misogyny were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it in my last comment.
You can see it differently: tell yourself that your own body itself is partly made up of this ancestral water.
I'm going to gain serenity.
ancestral so also this interstellar cloud (ouf, not traditional:))
You have not read the article correctly: a small half of the water in your pastis is more than 4.6 billion years old...
Yes, well, we can still consider that the pastis fleet is on average easily more than 2.3 billion years old, which is already not so bad as that
A blast to the catastrophists and warmers of all hair who predict the end of the oceans and water resources, when this water has always existed.
An irrefutable proof that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
Omanon tropolo: What is the evidence that the warming has stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo’s commentary is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and the irony, what do you have as your signaling?
So you don’t understand much about ecological issues.
It is not for the “catastrophists” as you say to worry about the disappearance of the oceans but rather about the reduction of consumable water reserves by humans (you know the fresh water that accounts for less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And more generally, it is not climate warming that is the most threatening for our species, but above all the reduction of scarce or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly gourmet lifestyles.
As for the study you are quoting and the generous effort of which you are making to cite the source, one cannot doubt the truth of the conclusion.
Regarding freshwater problems, I reassure you the French are far from being concerned xD Then we must stop considering ecology as a flawless dogma, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly (estimated at 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
Ecology yes, ecology religiously dogmatic and unreasonable, no thanks.
“Then we have to stop considering ecology as a flawless dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly” Yes, finally it’s not like it’s a spontaneous movement that comes from nothing.
I just want to specify that global warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our earth will look like Venus.
A greenhouse that by the action of oxygen will capture heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the greenhouse process exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct action so far?
Or the slightest sign that 10,000 men came to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, whatever that may be?
Surely not me!
In Abbott's little brain, perhaps sending the RAAF to the Middle East is his version of direct action.
We are going backwards, that is for sure.
When are they going to get rid of this village idiot?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% more CO2 than any allowed climate model give replanting priority.
This makes sense, since CO2 is the plant food that is most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora worldwide.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been flattened.
Have you seen the Green Army anywhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels rise from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument from plant food is just a deceptive distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulfur.
The most abundant of the biologically generated materials may be carbon, but that doesn’t mean it’s the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead’s argument is deceptive and deserves ridicule.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare’s budget has been severely reduced and that money is now being spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now invested where it will receive the most publicity to bring the Liberals back to the marginal electorates.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants make less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
It means that animals and people need to eat them in much larger amounts to enjoy their nutritional benefits.
That this member is childish is obvious.
So far, he has not presented a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from deviating from the rules of the 17th century.
However, sanctioning him and not Thévenoud is incomprehensible for a lot of people, even if the NA regulation is not a tax treaty.
That this lady does a whole thing is not in her honor, it seems mostly hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined all those who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Academy" was offended: "let's say Mrs. Keeper or the Keeper of the Seals" (a position that had never been occupied by a woman until then).
Pure machismo!
“The political arena.”
The sandbox, the back yard of the Republic replete, the marigold of the operetta gossip, the table of illusions, etc ...
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, willingly, unwillingly.
Qd the Phallocrate Umpiste sits on the etiquette and the parliamentary regulation by turning to the + elementary civility under the false umbrella of good manners, the sanction applies to him "is quality" for his partisan stubbornness and his misuse of the political arena.
The behaviour of this member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He makes provocations to make people talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, now he can be proud to be known as any cancer of a primary class.
The academy on the right back and you can see that the MPs are sensitive from the pocket...
The UMP will have to work on solving its internal problems and stop provoking coucacs and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when you make her say what she doesn't say.
This member behaves like a college student in the midst of a teenage crisis, who is provocative and whose friends go, in delegation, to see the Principal to cancel the glue hours.
and defending it on the basis of a text they didn't even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories of this forum of UMP deputies.
Judge, I call upon two expert witnesses who are separated by a few thousand years.
That’s why I like to spend time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and attractive.
Dogs, dolphins, sea lions, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure it gives them.
On the contrary, it seems that we spend the majority of our 80 years working, moving and doing stores.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to double our life span, but we spend the majority of it in boredom.
How did we get there?
Because of the illusion of anthropomorphism.
Play is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, “communication” necessarily involves a system of shared symbols.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I guess the concept of interspecies communication isn't compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog that I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates if the game will be a race, an object to go for, etc.
It’s not difficult and there’s no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that you hear a lot of bullshit about animals that are “playing” when they’re just communicating.
Maybe the game isn’t just “useful” (it may or may not be), it’s just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that “there is a principle of play that underlies all physical reality.”
“If he had learned in school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her.”
Thank you for the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, be healthy and be able to respond to an article today when you had to drink the news without being able to react just 15 years ago.
In general I am not against ideas, and would even tend to be quite enthusiastic about those that seem crazy at first.
But when one sees what many have learned from their schooling, especially among the public most likely to engage in assaults on women, my enthusiasm finds no beginning of anchoring.
"the public most likely to engage in assaults on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we understand.
And yes, reality doesn’t always smell the rose, even if it doesn’t necessarily match your thinking patterns.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods do not listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iPhone 6.
Evry's moneyless youth too!
If the reactions no longer reacted, Twitter would no longer offer to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choices.
I didn’t learn anything from it at school and I never raped anyone (and that’s not my intention).
Should I consider myself lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me certain values.
Family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do you start reading life when you can’t read?
And do young socialists go to suburban schools to teach gender equality?
It would be more effective than making moralizing montages on Twitter, but we would have to get out of the beautiful neighborhoods...
grotesque this campaign.
They're dumb everywhere, but to teach moral lessons, they're the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but I still want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke there about using his bread.
This week’s article isn’t going soft.
This isn't the time to make jokes about bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You made a two-way word game with the word “naan” to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a nursing home.
How come the more you pay, the less you have on the plate?
Because the quality of the experience is not necessarily measured by weight or number of calories, just as the quality of a film or piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a sparrow?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to get you to buy more dishes.
Of course, this should not be the case.
The Sportsman in Seasalter at least is a very good restaurant where both portions and prices are reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more expensive you pay, the more likely you are to receive a child portion arranged with art on your plate.
At least they made the effort to put up sheets.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good food?
The Manifesto for All is only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that’s right: a sort of gathering of homophobes.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of “child-making”.
A child should not be raised in a battery farm or manufactured by technological equipment.
Breeding in battery?
Where do you get that?
And if you challenge any technical intervention in “manufacturing”, you have to demand a ban on WFP for heterosexual couples, it would be the merit of coherence.
I am surprised that the alleged manifesto "for all" does not yet have this logical claim in its attractive catalogue.
It is true that it is not the only cathos who manifest: the other religions also, Jewish, Muslim, Protestant.
That said, it is still worth remembering that these different churches have ALWAYS been opposed to all evolutions of society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr Dupanloup was violently insurgent against the GVT's willingness to admit girls to school in the name of "defending the family".
We are always in the same pattern.
And more recently, the same currents screamed at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is, the credit that can be given to the positions of these people.
No need to be catho to be indignant about the commodification of the bellies and children...
All this is in line with the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly contested by others!
For me, freedom ends with that of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have the right to love each other as much as others.
But there is no question of tolerating that the child is a movable object.
And this also applies to straights in search of GPA.
I just can’t love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid moments of blazing stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other striker, apart from Heskey, who plays so many games for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored if he had been given more than 42 national team selections...
I can't disagree, at least not categorically :) Since this article talks about the goals it scored, I'm not going to talk about the other things it brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa don't bring or bring anything), but maybe that would be another reason why it won was much more often selected than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 October 07, 2014 12:48 pm Recommends 119 It's fashionable to criticize Rooney right now so we can forgive you for doing so too.
That said, it’s worth bearing in mind that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero has scored 56 goals and made 23 assists in 93 games.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 assists in 96 games.
So a lot of people will have to find another excuse to attack our Wazza because its stats on the ground are excellent.
“Wazza” is a good reason to ridicule him.
I have to ask myself if you really watch football or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would score as many goals if he had had as many selections.
I really don’t understand where the criticism comes from about Rooney’s abilities as a footballer.
The most difficult thing is to be regularly selected in the team of his country for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney’s (not even a striker’s) football skills to those of Peter Crouch?
You do that without joking?
There are really people completely in the crowd.
Please also note for your guidance that Rooney was not always England's top goal machine during his England team career.
Instead, he played the retired front, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind such players as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You probably wrote that by joking.
In a country where gun ownership is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people own a gun, I find it totally schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
Well, those at this school just don't agree with gun clearance in the US!
The use of the pencil is always suicidal.
Stop the bullshit: the girl is 5 years old.
How many kids are playing with fake guns at this age?
Does that make them potential killers?
Even though gun ownership is in the U.S. Constitution and it necessarily influences the culture of the country, I don’t think the rich kids are significantly different from ours.
A little common sense and reason kept please.
It's a disarming process!
Rendezvous you surrounded yourself!
The information on this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually possesses, or does not possess at all, firstfruits to the taste of the morbid.
Could we assume that a serial killer can’t already behave strangely at the age of 5?
If people need a Psych follow-up, it's more the maboules of this school than the pupils!
Let the parents get their child out of there: she is in danger!
I totally agree.
Those who run this school are obviously completely sick.
Your reaction is the most pertinent.
Alabama is not the most conservative state in the United States, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
His relative youth?
These glittering blue costards that men wear have nothing to do with an entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson wear at the beginning of their career?
In their first pictures, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a rolled-neck sweater.
I can't comment too much since I've never looked at this, but everything looks so boring and soulless.
I don't feel like that's what he meant.
Controversy, perhaps?
But what does it look like? It's depressing.
You got ahead of me.
I would have thought that a poor knowledge of English would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou is doing these days.
Perhaps by saying “obstracize,” he meant “alienate.”
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
At worst, if all the candidates dressed up like Carmen Miranda and Sugar was wearing a gray suit, it could be argued that their intention was to ostracize her.
But here, no.
Sounds like it was corrected – weird. Maybe the whole sentence was invented!
That's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he said?
Surely nothing, but someone absolutely wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was “obstract,” which meant absolutely nothing.
The unemployment rate in the United States fell further in August, by some 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
Gas prices are falling in all countries.
The U.S. economy, along with Obama, is continually strengthening.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Does their economy become “sustainable”?
To live there right now, I will say that the United States is gradually getting closer to the explosion as inequalities become insane there.
The political system is literally rotten by the state of campaign finance.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have an unimaginable magnitude in Europe, but Americans are keeping an incredible optimism about the future of their country and theirs!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago the English financial circles said that France was lost.
Now America is at the end of its roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of those articles that just forgets the essentials.
The level of consumption of the US economy is no longer sustainable.
Debts and billboards will not be able to change for a long time...
Against a backdrop of depletion of terrestrial resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and poorest, the vast majority of the citizens, will "twitch" or rather morph.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Will Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing compassionate voters from abroad makes it lose even more support at home?
Probably not.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any cost.
It was to please our American masters and their ongoing Cold War with Russia.
Labour's shameful performance, Ed Miliband is in the moor, it's played at 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that the Blair government’s massive immigration policy was designed to “push the nose of the right in diversity.”
Labour wins by-election, Tories lose by-election in secure siege against ukip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine that it is the same Multiculturalism that brings about this crank return, the pendulum has been going very far since the end of the war, and I imagine that now it will go back the other way.
Have you talked about your struggle with reality with a therapist?
Lol - Labour's safe seat, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in denial knows.
Sure, the Tories saw much worse, but for Labour it was a Pyrrhus victory.
Look for the word “victory” in any context, and you’ll see that when it’s used argumentatively against the word “defeat,” it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a win, but it's thin.
Labour should have won by at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a secure seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I’m indifferent no matter who wins in 2015 until the Lib Dems are there.
You obviously don’t understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ices of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia are hard.
On the other hand, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and Mars etc should not be considered as well?
In general, we must see the Earth more "pasteful" or malleable than we imagine.
Is that so?
A few small perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us of a “pretty simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the earth’s crust, the pressure on the mantle relaxes, which would give/would give a) a boost to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ???
In any case, either the “punch” or the facilitation of access to the surface will be localized (more or less).
As for global warming, it seems prudent to focus instead on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, patricedusud, does this volcanism have an effect on our environment?
Does it have an effect on our global warming, future or past?
Isn’t it wise to stop warming up?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yes, but also, when it's dark, you can't see better.
Hello, the end of the last ice age has also been accompanied by more seismic activity, especially in the "active" mountain ranges where on the continental parts very icy Canada, Scandinavia).
Congrats CB
It is too often unknown that the earth’s crust floats on the magma and that the moon’s passage alone makes it rise or fall by about 30 to 60 cm, in deferred, depending on its passage to the zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This gives that the sliding of the tectonic plates, like the tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving bump, especially since the polar caps are lightened by the melting of the ice, which therefore causes a change in the balances of the land at the equator, since the volume of the land remains constant.
I am amused by this "human," calling himself the supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commander-in-chief, ridiculing himself by his stupid action on the environment that created him and from which he so separated that it became harmful, and to himself and to that environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of this nature that surpasses him in the organization of his own viscera, by an invention that consists in finding all possible means to dominate his neighbor, one the other, making fun of collaboration, money.
The earth’s crust is not based on magma, but on the earth’s mantle, which consists of solid rock.
Personally, I find it impossible to look at.
Pretendious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Bronowski's Ascent of Man.
Definitely the next part.
Beautiful story Wild1
Rather, it reminds me of a totally great series from about 2002 called "Ape-man."
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely enough, hardly anyone remembers it now.
Too bad you never missed the first impression.
Your loss...
“Geladas, our distant ancestors” You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Great program thanks Brian
I’m pretty sure that the documentary “History of Humanity” has already been made several times, they’re still going to Ethiopia (of course).
Oh there I can't stand this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes to Ethiopia to pretend to make goose eyes in front of a brain in a jar.
And his narration...
It must be hard for you, forced to watch Coxy.
There may be a support group for you, that said.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully filmed.
Is Marcel Gauchet a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualistic identity that prevails today.
It therefore needs to be self, in-self, therefore non-conforming.
Of course, Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual questioning expresses this advent.
But at that time it was just the premises that appeared, today individualism structures the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the “mass” individualism!!
Without making it an insurmountable horizon, is there not some relation with the Cartesian approach of examining what one receives to believe, what one believes in oneself?
More than rebellion, doubt is fruitful.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter-reform!
By placing the problem at the level of his paranoid navel, he blocked any progress and any reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reductive and reactionary view that underlies: behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right on this point and to be non-conformist is to fight against this decercervelation.
Marcel Gauchet is accused of being a defender of order.
Excellent idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, some are asked.
Blacks and Rebeux, to the others.
Beaufs and robots, include the most followers of those who see themselves in their mirror.
Thank you in any case for your controversial protests to bring Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persevering humanist, so pedagogically enlightening, to the spotlight.
David Cameron Supports Increase in Inheritance Tax Threshold
How many more budget cuts will it take to pay the benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its net worth once he is no longer in power.
Corporate advice, speeches, consultation fees, a series of best-sellers written by a negro about “serious politics” – it will be worth $100 once he passes the gun to the left.
Of course, he doesn’t want inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as the last election?
And the richest are those who will most likely pay the least inheritance taxes thanks to super-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where inheritance kills innovation.
He'll be worth 100 pounds once he passes the weapon to the left.
Anything.
It’s likely going to promise to raise the threshold to $1 million, which is well below what you say it’s worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think that Brown was thinking only of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't elect him last time, we had a coalition instead.
You could only allow yourself to accuse him of lying if he had actually been elected to power.
Like the rest of us, “Dave” won’t die “normally.”
Climate change and imminent collapse will end him and the rest of them.
His “wealth” will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
A non-taxable income is a social benefit, especially in a country where government debt has exceeded 1,000,000,000,000 pounds.
We all need to be taxed to pay for essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I am not saying that discipline teaching is useless, of course, I am only saying that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "deficiencies".
Unreasonable statement for the math teacher she was!
Like what?
Better recruitment and training of teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class knows of no other approach than quantitative.
There are 2 possible answers, the first would be to select teachers based on their ability to transmit knowledge => reform of the recruitment modalities.
She hates children because she doesn’t understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced to establishing a relationship of distrust that makes everyone suffer in sheer loss => it would take 1 skill training to teach.
A job that can be learned, of course.
But pedagogy is above all an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before it is a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not about making auto parts.
Pedagogy doesn’t get in the equation even when you’re a math teacher!
"Education sciences" cannot compensate for a lack of natural abilities.
What is currently lacking is a real vocation at bcp of those who embrace the teacher.
If gifts exist, pedagogy (I prefer didactic discipline) allows those who have less ease not to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today are the students of which 1/3 tell us: learning is useless I already know what I think.
An article by Slate describes quite well the chaotic situation of this re-entry.
Let's regret the old Normal Schools of Teachers..
It ends at 3 a.m. from this week, but it begins at midnight.
If that's the case, it's fine with his schedule anyway.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't fit mine!
It's been years since her show started at midnight.
We have this thing called iplayer that allows us to listen to shows on demand when we want to!
The internet is pretty incredible, isn’t it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at home, I can't really listen to radio shows either.
I have a USB adapter on the back of my SKY box and it is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seems too complicated.
Yeah I think I was wrong in the schedules, I had to hear Richard Lester at about 3 o'clock.
Although they are men in the daytime on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman on her airtime when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least it would please people.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Her show is anything sensational disguised as debate, and she would be much better off on a channel like LBC.
The lack of female DJs during the day, where none of the regular animators, from Chris Evans in the morning to Simon May’s show in the evening on the way home from work, is a woman.
That's five shows.
Which one (of those five) is most likely to be changed.
Shennan knows this very well, but says nothing - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detached of these days.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the office as a real journalist, but lunch keeps all the chilly air of a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine he's quiet, waiting for the current team to get fed up or get fired.
I was born in Soissons in 1950.
Too late??
It is normal for these people to vote for the FN.
For 40 years we have had the same two parties that alternate in power and make the clefs from country to country in less good condition than they took.
The countryside is very poor, much poorer than the suburbs with more isolation.
You have to travel miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But since they don't burn cars, assault, deal, they don't interest politicians...
But please don't talk about a department you haven't lived in.
Yes, Doclocal, they are submen, sociology is good to look at them.
They have very high rates of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well.
The FN thrives on human stupidity, inculturation and ignorance as much to say that it still has huge growth potential, it really has to be bad for not having done better...
Today, the FN thrives mainly on misery, fear of everyday life, fear of the other and the feeling of having no perspective.
But yes, you are right!
What a pitiful humanity.
Fortunately, there are a handful of people like you, intelligent, educated and learned to save the honor.
They've been looking for him.
To take the voters for c...
That's what's happening.
Who's "they"?
"forgotten" in fact there is less and less resource =>lower endowments.
Here's the comment I left on Twitter: Listen - you can't just "add and mix", women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by that is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being challenged, such as childcare and socio-reproductive roles.
This makes it possible to recognize that women can work in the economic sphere and it's great - it's necessary.
But this is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double scourge, that is, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfill their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced my sister.
The economy and profits do not recognize gender roles.
Money speaks, and if one sex is not up to it, the next!
Profits make fun of the life you lead.
What are you doing, what is the advantage and what do you have to offer?
Profits mock heroism and the upbringing of children.
If it were a crime, companies would listen.
Employer friends will never employ women between the ages of 20 and 45.
Well said my sister.
It is very problematic that no one talks about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is carried out by women) must be more than 50% of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention the fact that men do not do enough), but it makes it possible to operate our societies and preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find real “economic emancipation” outside the home.
Thank you for your comments - to return to the point of Mskayadee, how can we take into account the disproportionate responsibilities assumed by women when conducting gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I’m sure it will help a lot people who have to “check a box”.
The tiger is not Russian, it is only Western propaganda.
The Chinese are solely responsible for the current situation and would be better off sitting at the negotiating table.
The self-determination tiger and Russian soldiers are simply in exercise near the border, exercises planned for a long time before the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missiles in its possession.
Free the Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, here.
I immediately came up with the same kind of idea.
This is an excuse to arm a few separatists with a view to annexing China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, then China is in Siberia.
It is only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article about a tiger, a beautiful feline and in real danger of extinction, eventually turn into an article directed against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This, therefore, is not a leaflet on the Siberian tiger, but a leaflet on the aftermath of a Putin-like operation.
When you expose yourself so much to the media, you also expose yourself to irony or even criticism.
The ritual of perpetual victimization of Soviet-Putinian sympathizers.
Hollande had also taken full pear with his camel without one crying out to the anti-French conspiracy.
There our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg Saint Protector of Great Russia was personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger understands everything, he goes away.
Hollande's got to be beaten, that's one thing.
At first glance, this seems to be a horribly condescending idea.
But based on the article, it looks like it’s both a response to a real problem – emergency dental grants – and effective.
It is therefore difficult to find anything to complain about.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed their teeth before, and 73% after, it makes little sense to complain about paternalism.
After all, there is no inconvenience to brushing your teeth!
Indeed - basically, the complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted towards the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if it turns out to be true, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said the ministry was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants being offered by the Department of Labour and Revenue of the Department of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I guess.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There is a problem with brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and stiff, it can sting the gums and cause inflammation.
And I remember a show on the Guinness Book of Records where someone had tried to brush their teeth the longest and the Guinness judges at the time strongly discouraged him from doing so because of the adverse effects of frequent and prolonged toothbrushing.
'At first sight' - very funny.
Sounds like a rotten experimental design to me.
Simply volunteering for this study will have changed the habits of participants who knew toothbrushing would be studied.
That's why most behavioral studies include things like double blind, control groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming these texts are sent to every young person who perceives benefits, there are two things that differentiate this from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not give feedback on the times they brush or do not brush their teeth (results easily fucked up by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Are there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including the uterus) can have effects on the genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these inherited traits can be passed on to the next generation.
Does Uterus Transplant Affect This Phenomenon?
The nesting itself resembles a kind of graft.
There are probably consequences, but as long as you don’t want to give birth to an impossible perfect clone of yourself, is it a priori a problem?
It seems to me that it is going beyond the limit of reasonableness.
The desire for motherhood and paternity must not push us to go ever further, without asking the question of ethics, of risk-taking, for the mother and for her baby.
No, medicine isn’t all powerful, it’s not limitless, and yes, it’s unfortunate and painful to accept that not all women will have the children they want to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the tram.
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go as far as taking risks, and manage your little testicles on your own, all alone in your little pants on your own.
to "give" them this magic bag so that they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him sterile in my safe if he can still give love?
Current tightened circumstances make PR FRYDMAN cautious about its communication, but if "we" agreed to think, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material that is involved.
What are we going to use as an anti-argument: see here these all-male reactions curiously...
Marjane, every organ donation has nothing wrong with it.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not totally trivial.
I had registered as a spinal cord donor (I was never selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understandable for both the recipient and the donor), this is a real operation.
Now as a man, I wouldn’t allow myself to judge in one way or another or take part in this gift, but I’ll listen to women talk about it.
Margane: In fact, it is not insignificant, and it reinforces the act of love that it implies.
Giving a kidney to a family member who needs it doesn’t have any anodyne either, and it does!
Please, no matches Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need that.
Especially since there is no competition anymore.
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
Deportivo has become a yoyo club.
They are too good for the Segunda but do not have the La Liga standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team of the title.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo continues to do everything he can to beat all Real Madrid goal records this season so he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a quiet conscience.
I can't believe it.
I believe Ronaldo will end his career at Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you're talking about the international oil investment company stage?
I was looking at it on a shitty connection so I can't tell you much about it except that Valencia defended well and not counting the possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid the midfielder would be overtaken too quickly but they played well.
The Parejo game as a whole is getting better.
A terrible penalty cowardly demanded but justly saved by Diego.
A Mestalla with a bustling atmosphere and it must not have been funny for the Atletico bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A full article, signed by the young researcher Amandine Marshall, “On the origins of mummification”, well illustrated, appeared in the magazine Archéologia 524 last September.
It’s good to have arguments to confirm and date what you guess intuitively.
No wonder before it was complicated, it was simple.
All science progresses in small steps.
And the "organ" of the woman that was thus preserved was?
Exciting!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me some time ago that a mummy of a black child had been discovered in present-day Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, especially geographical and temporal (I think the mummy was 1000 years earlier than the first known African mummies).
Do you have any information about this?
Thank you in advance.
It makes reading a bit difficult.
These may not be modern-day contaminations.
Didn’t the desert then extend farther than it does now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis growing where there is only sand now?
We know the song.
And it suffices for a European scientist to assert it, even without any proof, to be a scientific truth: the Egyptians and thus the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it is not always “of his ill-known predecessors”.
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal free market quacks that preaches against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people with Ebola who the Spanish government is lying to us about, so as not to give themselves a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is their last concern.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about tourism, but right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the UK) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than people.
Stop, feel free to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good-for-nothing and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very touristy place, I doubt it is their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?”
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allows millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say yes, it's important.
If they were to absolutely repatriate the missionaries, I do not see why they could not have sent them to an air base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy's mission was to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing the nationalized hospitals especially in Madrid, which is its power base, until the courts intervene.
He's just a right-wing PR scumbag like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's fucked up in the next election.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it’s not easy here) socially he’s far to his right and would find his place with right-wing religious fools in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had previously descended to try to achieve his goal which is to protect Spanish tourism.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European right-wing party to the Spanish right.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish government lies about almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting labor at the center of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not get away with it.
Excellent article but above all fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many TPE - SME bosses seem to be reading Le Monde to take the time to condemn Pr.
Let’s take a look at the anti-intellectualism of the environment.
A law professor at the Collège de France seems not to be able to know the labor market unless he is Nobel laureate of economics and proposes to liberalize it completely
It was so much better before, it's true when Dr. Villermé observed the work of 8-year-olds 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were shot because of a signed collective agreement.
The good old days...
Your reaction is equally fascinating because of your lack of knowledge of the profession of TPE boss!
His job is not to know the law in all its ways, but to manage and produce.
Four handwritten amounts inscribed on my salary card from my youth, more than 100 information today!
Here is an example, one could cite much more, which illustrates the continuous flow of constraints, imposed without measure of consequences, and that stifle small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a Sorbon client.
To turn a blind eye to the archi-resurrected argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code in relation to the Helvetian, a serious academic would have plunged into the Swiss texts and would have compared the amount of official texts, then that of the comments (the absence of the latter may mean that the Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
By commenting in a Code, whether it is work or not, we aim at jurisprudence in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for enforcing the laws when an employee is fired, for example.
Who is it complicated about??
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, jurisprudence, conventions, contracts) are in matters of Labor and Commerce unbearable obstacles?
What's he doing?
How long does it last?
Pullmann "Art has practically been immunized against criticism by Mrs.
Is this guy still in vogue?
It is surely time for new revolutionary absurdities to overturn criticism.
For every Ai Weiwei article I’ve read recently, you’re one of the first three comments to complain about its popularity.
Move on!
Go elsewhere, the choice is not lacking in the art world.
If China can produce new artists who are not spokespersons for the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokesmen for the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think Ai Weiwei’s art is a kind of fraud, here’s what you’re missing.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I apologize, but it had to be exposed at all costs (without making a bad word game).
He's the guy who breaks down the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There is art, and then there is vandalism seeking to attract attention.
Real artists make a difference.
A beautiful artist.
His father is also a poet.
His father was a well-known poet in China.

This gentleman is unworthy to hold an elective mandate extremists of all sides (including Zionists) must be sidelined.
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have earned him several judicial convictions, shame both Israel and the town hall of Neuilly.
He does not represent either.
Philippe Karsenty leads his fight against the truth alone, on the margins.
WHO REMEMBERS ASSEMBLY
What does the City Council of Neuilly intend to do against Philipe Karsenty, who is abusing a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls for attacking this urbanist?
Murder apology?
Can't find Neuilly on my card?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges???
This guy needs care, like Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the anti-Jewish/anti-Israel conspiracy theory and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their furious detractors.
Just as many people believe they see in every political decision the hand of the “Zionists” (a term whose meaning tends to disappear, because of its abuse), these two, as well as the LDJ or even the CRIF, believe they see in every criticism, even banal, an abject anti-Semitism “which is reminiscent of the darkest hours of our history.
Karsenty’s incredibly stupid theories about Charles Enderlin’s reporting are even more stupid than those about 9/11.
And God knows the 9/11 conspiracy theories are gross nonsense.
And this guy has political responsibilities, which is extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the 9/11 conspiracy theory, we talk about cognitive dissonance regarding how to approach the subject.
Totally blinded by a totally phony truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to support this one, it is unbearable for the adept of this theory to detach himself from it (as in the case of extreme religious).
There follows a logical and inevitable flight forward, the end justifies all means, even the lie, which is a peak, but does not seem to disturb the mission of the concerned.
You advise to be careful and not to put everyone in the same basket, but that’s what you do for September 11.
There is still a plethora of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudi consorts don’t seem to be in a hurry to answer them.
There are indeed very far-fetched theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny anymore...
Health NGOs and public health spokespeople found that the results of the study were largely in support of their outreach efforts.
And, of course, they will need even more grants to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized so that what it really is, alcohol will also know its hour of judgment where the actual harm it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it’s easy to just say things like “excessive alcohol consumption is on the rise,” but what requires (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
Sorry if you think this is an attack - go have a drink and relax?
It's better to risk it than to put my mental health at risk by abstaining from it.
The government puts an end to pleasures when it costs them money.
Here are other alarmist tips based on unreliable statistics.
Two average drinks a day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies that it is a more or less safe amount.
Perhaps the Council on Cancer and the National Council on Health and Medical Research should come together (around one or two drinks, but mostly not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now we're going to tax them thoroughly, like smokers!
They are already doing it - soon it will be grass!
My father didn’t drink or smoke, and the cancer took him to 64.
So I will continue to drink my two bottles of red on Friday and Saturday nights (and other nights when my wife is not there).
Why the Cancer Council encourages children to go to places where alcohol is served This is old news that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What isn’t linked to a cancer risk these days???
Sharks don’t catch cancer – they eat anything but they’re not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting’s incompetence has been a recurring topic for many years.
Refusing to run when you could run and vice versa.
I totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's yes-blessed yes.
Both of them destroyed F1 under the guise of safety.
Hopefully he'll make it better than Schumi or less so Wendlinger's going to crash in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but beware of point number 1: it is not the F1, but the instances of the circuit that refused to advance the start so as not to miss the TV broadcast slots.
Absolutely accurate, +1
I would just like to wish a prompt and quick recovery to Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, incidents that almost happened between troubleshooting cranes and f1 were free warnings.
We knew that one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, has been saying it for years.
How the hell did the racing organization and the FIA allow these maneuvers without taking out the safety car?
I can't accept that you invoke the risks of the trade or the fault with no luck when you haven't prevented the predictable.
But this accident was.
It must also be said, however, that there was a yellow flag, which does not only mean "prohibition of overtaking in the area" but has as its main purpose to signal a danger.
It's not shameful, it's fortunately for the family that was supposed to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just raise their feet.
In changing conditions, the turn can be much more tricky the next lap and the rider, believing to arrive with enough margin, can be made to have even at "reduced" speed compared to a normal pace.
But, well, we're talking in the void there, until we've seen the images, we're not going to be able to give a posed opinion.
I don't see much of what that changes.
Are there any injured?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the info this morning before it happened, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
Hard to believe there are still jobs where you have to be on duty 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are any people injured because Canada is almost empty.
There may be injured animals like bears, raccoons, etc.
I hope this is irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population densities in North America and the Toronto metropolitan area has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan countryside, trains do not derail as if by enchantment and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains run very, very often within a day.
In addition, because roads often follow rivers in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass in densely populated places, because people always want to live near the water.
Also, all rail traffic crosses the center of a city since this was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is huge potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge made a report about it last night, really shocking.
You obviously haven't read the article about the derailment and explosion of a train in a Quebec city that killed 47 people?
In fact, you are partly right.
Vancouver was a port city long before the railroad.
That said, when the railways were built, they passed through the center of established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the National Canadian Railway Society are expected to attend the next Hazardous Products Conference in Calgary, Canada on December 2 and 3, 2014.
CN employees have extensive training in the transport of hazardous products.
This article, like many commentaries, impasse on the primordial religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there can be no other truths.
The whole problem is there and the exegeses of theologians only reinforce this fact, otherwise what good is it to talk about the sex of angels?
"God said: that's good - that's bad" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (alternative: theocracy).
A Muslim leader said, “But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?”
In other words: obey priest rabbi imam and pray your prayers, it will be better!
Reported below, (Nowak): pb settled in 1905 after 40 years of struggles against the priests.
May His Nouilles appendix touch you.
Yes, that is what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in a way trying to found a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: that of the strong Euro (pretty pale right now) or that of the free market (fairly supported by the state when it needs to be bailed out), etc.
Great ideas from religious uprisings.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is in the trailer and expresses themselves in schism.
Religion was born as the ideological support of the state, and the gods put at the service of ambitions even though it also bore forms of contestation.
Theology torn between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to the airs of time knows no doubt.
Fanaticism is often described as a misinterpretation of “sacred texts.”
This does not resist the examination of these texts which are filled with explicit appesl to the hatred of the unbeliever.
Rather, it is the moderate religious (and fortunately they are the most numerous) who “read the texts badly” and retain only the humanism and values common to the whole of humanity, atheists and various believers.
To me, fanaticism is the foolish and wicked application of passages of sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, some verses of the Qur'an calling for the killing of "unbelievers", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if one does not read a few verses higher or lower specifying that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked in legitimate situations, killed in defense, and killed.
on Yves Petit:" concerning the "scarf", it is indeed a religious prescription that today is almost unanimous among the "wise".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive thing to draw from this is that it provoked a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same harm as the one shown in the clip?
Band of overpaid and hypersexualized Neanderthals.
They have outraged humanity enough!
What have they really brought us apart from being outraged by Yahoo, For Life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein Junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Shano Kidman, Russell Crowe, the Bee Ware Sa Gee Sees
An insult to our intelligence, that's what they gave us!
If you took your eyes off the TV for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with cave and stone paintings made by its indigenous peoples and still inspiring modern artists today.
And then there’s the Sydney Opera House and a national opera company that has produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema has produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is a New Zealander, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me be of another opinion.
Sox does not need any help in this section.

Nice effort Savantcosi!
But you may not know yet that Kastals is just a small telegrapher from Moscow who has only that to do with his days.
We leave him for a month and when we come back he is pouring the same salads.
Almost all of the 331 deaths since the ceasefire are civilians from Donbass who have been bombed by the army, due to uncontrolled elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of responsibilities hypocritically suggested in the article without daring to go so far as to explicitly name the separatists is in the tanastic line of the World that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the kind pro-European neo-Nazis bravely facing the evil Russians.

If I understand your words the bad guys are the Ukrainian SS and the nice Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a little communist by chance
Excerpt from the (very long) document you are quoting about MH17: "this post is absolutely not meant to say that pro-Donetsk resisters are innocent."
The Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation says, he, that Ukraine is responsible.
From the propaganda?
To Alexander Kastals: where do you get these details about the macabre countdown?
From the Ukrainian army (she unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Uncontrolled elements (likely to say anything)?
ALLEEEEEEZ ROMANIA!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That said, I can't stand Piturca's team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the powers in place who has not stopped denigrating Romanian football up to the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the “Cooperativa”, which decided before the start of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which ones would be relegated, and which laundered the money at will, mainly by selling players who were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, did business with the aforementioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about one million euros), then paid them, but, apparently he was badly advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have earned him a sentence without sentence served), and consequently took 3 and a half years in prison.
The trial also earned the brothers Becali, four club owners, steua manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, prison for football-related offenses.
George Becali is also serving a sentence for trying to bribe (and then hiding the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the last game of the championship, to be able to win the title and win the jackpot of the Champions League.
The team he tried to bribe were our neighbors from Cluj, Universitatea.
We won 1-0 in their stadium, a result that allowed us to be the first champions in Cluj, while they were relegated.
I always enjoy this moment.
In the cover-up of this attempted corruption was implicated, among others, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document insinuating that the money that the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to a sale of land.
So this poor uneducated, idiotic, cheating, lying guy doesn't represent me, and never will.
Hungarians are just a bunch of stupid nationalists these days.
You might think that after the last time they broke stadium armchairs and shop windows, and where they wore racist banners in the streets they couldn't have had tickets this time, but no.
I thought Neil Lennon was about to take over at Al-Ittihad.
Wherever he ends up, it will be a disappointment, after Stockport County turned him down.
Great article.
If it had been Sarkozy who had done this, we would have heard the left screaming like a big sick woman.
But since it is the good Hollande, friend of the trade unions and the little people, we hear a little protest, but low
This is why economic circles sometimes prefer that a party claiming to be left-wing settles in power.
It is the bankers who have financed Obama’s victory, and they have not been deducted from their investment!
"the absurd idea that the majority of job seekers are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)
Should the employment pole generalize the control of the unemployed in early 2015?
I hope that in the aftermath, fiscal pole will also generalize the absolute control of the plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evas, thieves bosses, and other thugs.
Can you say a phrase without the words banksters or plutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time.
This is true when we have class: we treat the population of illiterate and toothless
With each new period of unemployment it is dozens and dozens of applications that I address to employers who most often do not even boast of an acknowledgment of receipt, it was automated.
It is also the total lack of follow-up or support on the part of the Employment Pole.
To conclude, I would add that the “socialist” name of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read an article of the duck chained here?
One learns that an unemployed person may be left without news from his agency for several months, but that he must continue to look for jobs on his own.
It is reported that the controls have removed people who, for more than half, no longer received unemployment benefits.
So you wonder how you can control people you never see.
One wonders what a penalty is for someone who has no access to employment services or unemployment benefits.
And if we can admit that this reform will allow us to cancel more, we wonder how it will help the recruitment.
“You learn that an unemployed person can be left without news from his agency for several months, but that he must continue to look for jobs on his own,” he said.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe’s egalitarian ideals?
Isn’t it like the Spanish or Italian authorities have done a lot about racism in football either?
Should they be expelled from the EU?
The EU was originally only economic and should remain so.
The goal is not to be a “thought police.”
The EU is a pacifist project.
It makes no economic sense.
This is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality???
Eastern European teams are constantly being harassed by the corrupt mafia referees of UEFA.
The best solution would be for the whole East to leave this rotten lucrative organization and create its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This anti-racism crusade is just a screen to cover up injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Money and trade, rather.
European ideals of equality?
So what’s wrong with letting the UK in?
UEFA should applaud them for foiling Blatter's comedy and his men.
It's been happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
Taken from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Was he hoping to be retorted with small symmetrical sentences, just a matter of maintaining the controversy?
Anyway, it’s a fact that at every little event toward peace, there have been, there are, and there will be people working to throw oil on the fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western states are against a “Palestinian state”, that they are pro-Israel and that alone explains that these states have never done anything against the Israeli state.
The decoding would be to say that in order to solve the Israeli-Palestinian issue, action would have to be taken against the Israeli overarmed identity state occupying besieging destructive oppressor colonizer
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine at the expense of an Arab population that was not in the Shoah at all, it would have been more reasonable to empty Bavaria of its Germanic inhabitants (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with surviving Jews.
It would have been fair, the Germans had nothing to demand and Europe would have kept millions educated, enterprising and dynamic.
Take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara.
The fact that Morocco is a colonialist is obvious.
But, as with Israel, it is also necessary to question history, its allies and its supporters in order to glimpse the truths.
Colonialism, whatever it may be, has never been altruistic, we agree.
So stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
Gaul was colonized by the Romans but currently there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination based on origin.
Moreover, the Israeli state defines itself as that of a “Jewish people” of which no non-Jew can be a part.
The Israeli state discriminates against non-Jews, hence the litigation.
Conclusion: to resolve the conflict, we must break with Zionism between Jews and non-Jews.
In the Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized by the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities that we must stop ignoring.
First, the European Zionist project (colonizing Palestine) involved dispossessing the Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution requires breaking with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay lacked a bite from the start.
Their dull result will give them something to bite their fingers with.
He should begin his rehabilitation with small bites.
I hope he hasn’t lost his appetite for the game.
So much nonsense is tolerated, including racial insults and physically tough tackles in football, but Suarez has been punished too harshly.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what the purists say.
Yeah, I hate all those molars.
Football is a contact sport where tackles exist and yes, therefore, players will get hurt.
Getting your teeth into the flesh of an opponent for the advantage certainly has no place in the game.
A rugby player was suspended for 80 games for committing a similar move.
This is the third time Suarez has done this.
If you bite someone at work.
What would be the consequences in your opinion?
I knew someone was going to bite.
If you are dyslexic, I forgive you.
I am indeed slightly dyslexic.
I forgive this sarcasm with two bullets.
I bet he was looking forward to coming back to play full-tooth.
All these word games about Suarez are losing their biting.
I almost bite at the hook.
A prerequisite for a good school course is the respect by the students of their teachers and the school institution.
It works if parents instill that respect in their children.
Parents pass on this respect more easily if they also feel respected by their children's teachers and school.
In good institutions, those who advance their pupils, parents are considered partners, not emm..
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do all the work (teaching, educating, learning respect, limits, living together briefly) It is up to the parents to do at least 50% of the task.
But it's probably easier to go to school.
Betting on parents is not operational.
No one really took them.
Action will therefore remain limited.
However, the school could do a lot.
The operational solutions reside there.
Should the actors (professors, hierarchies and ministry) play their role and do not constantly release in touch.
We can disband a company that's scrambling to revive it, not the families.
How not to talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses make it possible to make the change.
We pretend to be teachers, but we forget the primary role of the school.
Transmit knowledge.
And if there is a requirement of parents, it is that the school ensures the education of their children.
Who is the minister who will dare to re-establish what was called Public Instruction?
Disappointing article: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Did you really expect a smart comment from this beauf of the eastern suburbs?
It's a beauf, of course, but I think it's more of Willoughby, and therefore of the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budget emergency.
Drop it and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
Quite true
That's right.
A little Aloysius.
Its electorate is the seat of North Sydney.
Definitely a beauf of the North Coast!!!
Well, if British BBC viewers want to compare the neoconservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
He looks like a grumpy guy these days. :(
Yeah, but well his leader leaves him regularly on his hunger.
You would also be rather grumpy if you woke up one morning and realized that you would never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these legal and illicit benefits for life would remain out of your reach forever.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He tried to come up with a budget and then gave up.
At least he doesn't threaten to hit someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will know how to order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and ask for state aid.
And as she knows how to lobby, no fears about the outcome.
And so much for the job in France that it has nothing to do with, it emanates from vegetables always ready to break when their corporation has losses in the markets, external in particular...
it is precisely because their lobbying has not worked that the order has been cancelled.
If the company had obtained the deadline or arrangement for marpol, there is no doubt that the project would have been successful.
Afterwards, to know if it is right or not and how BF will comply with the law in spite of everything, it would be nice if "the world" leans over!
The company Brittany Ferries is owned by the Breton vegetables.
Those who burn the tax and secu centers.
They want state aid.
It doesn’t seem normal to me at least.
Well, since arming a ship under French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, yes, it is normal to wait for a boost from the state.
Or else we are condemned to tolerate that the British monopolize the market.
It's your choice.
An eternal French problem that considers its maritime facades as tourist destinations, and not as areas of activity, where sometimes people live different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investments, of envy all along.
One of the reasons why Britain must regain its sovereignty.
That's it and then they'll create the Breton flag with crews made up exclusively of pure Bretons.
This will reduce costs significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that’s what we expect from the BBC now.
They've always hated everything about the prog, so it's no surprise that they chose to skip Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to the spirit of the '70s Genesis than the other members of the band.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don’t understand how important it was to sound, you don’t really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel’s solo work either.
I don’t think the BBC can be accused of “hate everything about prog,” since they just aired a 1.5-hour documentary about one of the biggest prog groups ever.
I haven’t seen the documentary yet, but it’s a movie about the Genesis group, not its members’ solo projects.
As for Hackett’s solo career that would be “closer to the Genesis spirit of the 70s,” I disagree.
Hackett is no more entitled to take the road, play a bunch of Genesis songs on which he has had varying degrees of participation and claim to have an affinity with Genesis than David Gilmour is entitled to put together a bunch of half-finished demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett asks for nothing more than fair representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely awesome, and quite in the Genesis spirit of the '70s.
They missed Hackett’s solo career because, let’s be honest, she’s scared.
Yes, it’s one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been made if they hadn’t had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I still haven’t seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary about groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant that have an equally interesting story but lack the popular appeal that Genesis has.
Good remarks.
I would still say that the BBC “always” hated the fact that it LOVES progressive music over time.
A person with a personal interest shouts “prejudice”: of course.
A little more of the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrific act by another horrific act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a resounding success.
There will always be a difference in size between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his distorted understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so from the fairest and wisest vision and reflection of a society.
In other words, they have no excuse.
They are indefensible.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time.
That is precisely where the difference lies, Mr LeClos.
One must have a dissatisfied mind with the common mortal in order to enjoy violence.
This is what the criminal does from his distorted understanding of things.
But this is also what pain, hatred and vindication produce in the relatives of the innocent victim: a distorted understanding that can never be relied upon by those who wisely decide the death of others from the sound and just reasoning of their pedestal.
But, in an attempt to balance the analysis, it could still be argued that the condemned person has often exercised savage violence, which he has been able to enjoy, against fundamentally kind people, who have paid for it free of charge.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain alleviated with the disappearance of the one who was the executioner, sometimes the torturer, of the loved one and who haunts their nights.
Let us not despise their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this thought, which I think is very correct.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he shows great intelligence.
That of the heart.
That’s probably what I’ve been reading for a long time.
However, it would seem to read stories from another era, old things, that the barbarity of the past would excuse, and then here are the dates that clap, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
The same goes for the other two “Excellent American Novels” mentioned here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all overwhelmed.
I thought you stopped the white one, man.
What does that mean?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is immeasurably better than the grievous Bellow, who received the award.
Perhaps this year’s Nobel judges have decided that if we have to have an American winner, we could just as well have a [light] racist one.
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce “genius novels” as if it were a literary genre.
His namesake Joseph, on the other hand,
Which ones did you read?
How many books of DeLillo did the Anti-DeLillos read?
I never finished Underworld, but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
What is Human Moments in World War III?
White noise?
The first lighter, more crazy, smaller novels, and their dialogues, are also great.
I don’t know if I’ll ever end up underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough of DeLillo’s books to reject his writing talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be conflict...???
It's just interest.
It was a humour, “the law,” not a request for definition.
Between the text and the mind, it seems so obvious here that the lady acted in her own interest, and absolutely not in that of the institution she represented, that one wonders what the term "conflict" comes to do there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope it will be very expensive!
Yes, state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they did not warn him of the danger.
After that we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and only seek tranquility.
The flood zones that become buildable overnight when a big construction program is going to start there, it’s classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at the floodplains near the rivers.
We were told that “now there are no more floods thanks to regulatory barriers”.
Now we have to enlarge the lakes of retention upstream and cross our fingers.
But it will be because of the state services, of course...
Profit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is the interest clearer?
Take out the calculator and you will dream of the life you could have had by being in the place of Mrs. Babin, 1st Assistant UMP of La Faute sur Mer and former president of the Urban Planning Commission, the one who grants the building permits!
The 2 nipples of the triumphant Sarkozysme are old and real estate.
I'm on the left and not at all sympathetic to Sarko, but please, no political lows or lows all around, we're not in there in a fight of stink balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
U.S. cops are hardened criminals.
The US is a shithole.
So what kind of shithole are you living in?
The United States is not a shithole.
Yes, American cops are hardened because of the scoundrels they deal with on a daily basis.
Of course none of them ever do anything but the cops “come and fuck them because they’re racist.”
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic in the US, it is unfortunate that an incident like this is needed to force people to see the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals a profound ignorance of the US...
You're ignoring him here.
Good cops must denounce corrupt racist cops.
Sell them!
Do the calculation.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is this your first time participating in a conversation?
It’s not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant when in fact it’s clearly you who get nothing – many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem that racism is in the United States (it’s not idle speculation).
It is very likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate how much tension is rising about it right now.
And as a result, the boundary between public service and private security for power and privilege, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street funds the NYPD in various ways, hence the treatment Occupy underwent there.
What amazes me is the naivety of some and I am shocked by the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think the investigative journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They will interrogate those responsible, make them talk, create confidences.
That Lhomme goes to the Elysee is really nothing surprising.
Then, what matters is the overlap, the verification, the analysis.
And here it is understood that sarkolasts have trouble to do.
Munstead, our current president, was elected on a wave of antisarkozysm based on cases mounted from all quarters (a non-place and no conviction) that seem to have been concocted by magistrates (2 references in correctional), two journalists who are friends of Hollande.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, the executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, it is that your partisan spirit blinds you!
RV with Holland.
And of course all this is just coincidence and not remotely driven!!!...
If you think that only supporters of Sarkozy are outraged!
From the extract I was able to read, the VA article just watered the sprinkler.
I even laughed at it so badly.
For the rest, the complaint of the World is unlikely to succeed because journalists are not "forced" to the secret of the sources, is it?
The difference is that there seems to be no collusion between VA and the power while there seems to be collusion between the power and the journalists of the World for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from the World on the merits and its dangerous relations.
We are right now facing a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the fall of the government involved.
Hence this editorial to the abois, which says a lot about complicity with the current government.
It’s not a question of the left or the right, it’s more serious.
I would have thought that the herring would be fine with the smoked herring!
It's just for the numbers and to cut salaries and create housing problems, I'm sure if I was a second-generation immigrant whose life was enjoyable because my parents had come here I'd have my doubts about the issue of immigration but that's not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC show on immigration was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people coming in and the changes they were bringing with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all cooperating, even refusing to give soup just because of his lady's religion, he also refused to worship him.
“He said he wasn’t comfortable.”
As we all know, if we let it go, the UK will continue to go to the right - anyone who imposes limits and challenges this should be admired even if he is a pub director :) So much the better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more left-wing, it would be communist.
What do you think New Labour has done that is particularly left-wing?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS this over and over again, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms to poke the nose of the right into it), the culture of benefits, the age of all-is-permissible, the political correctness that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is center-left and not communist, I said that to joke, what I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
This is typical of the left, if you will.
Let go of your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I have asked of you are specific examples of leftist politics, or a left-wing agenda defended by the New Labour government.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought New Labour was doing that was particularly right-wing.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah - it's more of Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the UK’s most powerful advertising director, associates the situation of his parents with that of the economic migrants who come to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to the French!
We fought in 40-45 to fall into another dictature, that of money.
We'll make nice savings by flipping these technocrats...
I would have to renegotiate the treaties.
Either, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" still makes sense in Europe, shouldn't it?
Curiously, the commission does not look at unfair tax competition between countries vis-à-vis corporations.
This must be a negligible amount.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem.
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector fully marketable.
In terms, this means that entire parts of French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment of many territories will only increase.
Sacrificing everything, including the avancer of a country, in the name of the liberal doxa does not seem to me a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to be addressed one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clear the SNCF's accounts.
The French government has long since resigned.
The regions feel like they are paying for nothing, but not the means to force the sncf to live up to its commitments.
Using public money without waste is essential in these days when public resources are constrained.
And the huge needs.
I don’t know what the competition for TER could be.
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If so, shouldn't he be a wolf chief?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during the marriage and that you are, of course, still coming to terms with the pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Obviously, having an ex-alcoholic living so close to you and having what appears to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would make sense for me to start the process of separating your life from the complications you inherited.
Looks like they're doing it, but it seems hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist as new ones surface, have you thought of a “leak plan” so that you can make a cut between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a detrimental effect, but with a compassionate real estate credit company, a good lawyer, and a little pressure from the court, they can be solved.
He looks vindictive and persistent.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group to say things openly and offer support to help her get back to work and pay for child support.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made up of more things than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not necessarily keep his promises about contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will handle disappointment if he does not keep his appointments.
Try to keep in touch with your father.
If they see that you are doing this for their good, despite your own resentment over how he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never stop loving you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a continuing parent-child relationship, they will know who to thank when they grow up.
I believe that children eventually understand who is at fault, if we let them see things for themselves.
Going a little more effort you are close to Godwin point.
It is folded, in 30 to 40 years civilization will have disappeared, short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the pot of earth against the pot of iron.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that does the least socially, fiscally and environmentally immediately has a competitive advantage, and the others are forced to follow.
All politics are looking for is growth, growth.
International coordination is needed, but by then...
It is not climate-sceptics that produce C02.
Those who get warm, those who use the air conditioning, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in housing that had to be built, those who buy industrial products that had to be produced and transported.
It was not the climate-sceptics who protested against the eco-tax, but the truckers.
No policy is climate-sceptical and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climate-sceptics emit more CO2 than others.
Environmental advocates also travel for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they matter, will not suffice.
There is also a need for political action (other energy sources, reducing dependence on cars, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to the sensitivities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous promise McArtur made on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
The Terminator has just taken up the phrase.
But it may be humorous to say that the expression is Terminator.
"greenhouse gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but any good apostle of the RCA dogma seems to know what it is about.
Does anyone know what the greenhouse effect is?
Guardian Bingo: How Long Before Someone Puts the Blame on Immigration?
I'm putting the blame on the scoundrel who took all the money.
Are we counting the Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm claiming my $5.
I blame the liars of the Democrats.
Or the crooks of Democrats.
Or the liars of labor.
They don't care, they're the ones responsible.
Population displacement could be a very real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump into a car or plane to escape the epidemic simply move the infection faster than they can imagine.
Is sex with monkeys better?
You think it's a virus?
I do not advise you to apply for a prescription for antibiotics.
He contracted Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse contracted Ebola in Spain.
Damn, indeed!
Don't use the word immigration, you're going to scare the horses!
The UK depends on immigration to pay for all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their toilets, to bury the 30,000 people who die every year from hypothermia or hunger, (don’t forget your wool and hat, which allow you to warm up, turn off the heat AND eat this cheese sandwich).
Don't be such a jerk.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a joke or is it not intentional?
It's more comfortable...
This is how public money is wasted to allow a tiny minority of individuals to have a good time in space making galipetes and purring while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
So reality TV hasn’t invented anything and the authorities are surely waiting for a baby to be designed up there to ignite the world and take away the media coverage of Western royalties accustomed to tabloid motherhoods.
Maybe they should go back down to earth and see that we're working here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, we don’t send men or women into space to make galipettes or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for humanity in general.
And this, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily lives come from space research.
So yes, it’s money spent usefully.
Can you cite one thing that improves our daily lives and is the result of space research?
It's just a money hole.
the ballpoint pen that works the tip in the air (for writing on the ceiling for example)
To pay his bills?
To participate in the manufacture of another unnecessary product?
Or how to make more money for investors?
In short, working for work means nothing and represents emptiness itself.
This is the latest high tech game.
Behind the tiny minority of individuals going into space, there are several tens of thousands of others working to make it possible.
You know, people who work what, including more and more private companies, including getting the freighter to the station.
If you're thinking about buying a plastic gun...
But what about those who don’t think about buying plastic guns now but have the potential to buy them in the future?
They are perhaps the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to mislead people into believing it is a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, it would have hurt the author/editor to put a photo of the “sword” in question instead of generic photos of “plastic swords”?
Or even be curious enough to wonder what the inscription meant (if any) who was on it?
A typical bad report focuses on the fact that “it’s just a plastic sword” and not on the inspiring jihadist text that’s written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shia Islam.
Dirani’s family, on the other hand, is a Shia Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups that seek to bring down governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people would stop laughing at the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be deadly.
Even the little cutlery that is given in the fast restaurants can pierce the flesh.
Thank you very much for this info, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the ridicule that the author gives it.
There’s no point in trying to make it a “ha, ha, plastic sword,” the facts as you stated them actually support his argument.
I occasionally saw these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they never looked threatening, just another version of a “cross”.
Jesus, you are right.
And it makes sense now...
I saw this guy who looked like he was from the Middle East at Kebab Stop and was handing out plastic knives to anyone all night!
I really like the conclusion.
All the wonderful novelties, often technological, give to many people that it is a right and a need to benefit from it, but they have an immediate cost and worse, a spread cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that weigh on the budgets.
And the impossibility of taking advantage of new technologies leads to frustration.
For example, make use of the Solidarity Energy Pact, which allows you to isolate the attics of a house for 1 € symbolically when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the works are taken care of by the energy suppliers in fact!).
Simple effective but unknown even if more than 3,000 houses have been so isolated this year!
Interesting this PES.
But I've never heard of it.
Who can appeal and how does it work?
for information 60 million consumers, tests water-saving showers and recommends the installation of water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 can reduce their water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 /year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water savings per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
It’s not a demand crisis, it’s a system crisis that can no longer produce enough surplus (which it would then have redistributed as revenue increases in real terms) for those surpluses to pay for the increase in spending that you rank in the “constrained spending” category.
In other words, energy precariousness is “just” the flip side of the fact that the economy can no longer grow as fast as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of economics is totally incapable of answering such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element likely to constrain, increasingly strongly decade after decade, the pace of economic growth.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what makes it possible to achieve any physical transformation.
Since producing, basically, is transforming, energy is what makes it possible to realize any economic production (goods or services).
And the more you want to produce, the more energy you need.
This means that any upward constraint on obtaining energy (improperly called "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, in turn compels production (except to improve energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy insecurity and whether or not we can grow cheap energy production.
And very officially published data, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only get worse in the years and decades to come (the IEA, in these last reports, clearly indicates that we have reached the peak of production of conventional oil, understand, cheap oil.
Now oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very high energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good work whatever the performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn’t bring anything back so it equalizes things.
Take that to France!
Vote No on the 18th.
Are you a webmaster of the Guardian?
As I said before, it’s good to win.
It's good to win.
That's a good job, guys.
While many Englishmen like to make fun of the Scots when they just lose, there’s nothing to say, they bring a bit of color to tournaments when they manage to qualify, at least until they get knocked out in the first round.
It’s even more fun if you play against them.)
England is beginning to worry me.
Because now that the “golden shige generation” is retiring, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the starting XI, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, really was “international-class” is David Beckham, a bit effeminate, perhaps, but I believe that if he hit an overweight potato like me, he would crush me completely.
People forget his athletic constitution, by the way, when talking about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I never make fun of the Scots.
I tend to surprise myself by watching their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, was truly “international class” is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best, a very good player.
Juppe would have struggled to ask for 100,000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he would get them if he asked for them...
You mean people come here to make fun of you?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on his deputies' indemnities...
I especially wonder what he can say in his lectures.
How to reduce your deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious lecturer of a scientific discipline, regardless of its scientific level, even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will think of asking for any sum.
Conferences with content are mostly free or almost free.
And I can assure you that these young people are really working and that the results presented in their lectures – free of charge – are real.
At the time of restrictions on the research budget, the relationship between these two figures is edifying.
Researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
Everything lights up for me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
Do I feel like I’m being blamed for making money???
I’m far from one of his fans, but he’s blamed for being hurt (or fraudulently) running his OK campaign.
But giving lectures seems to me to be quite a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let's remember that her travels are handled by taxpayers.
The first rule of epidemiology is to isolate yourself.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than political correctness.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential locations.
At what density of infection will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the UK, I take the plane to Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the UK.
If Ebola worsens in West Africa, I see them banning all flights and boats to the UK.
We would always need to send goods that said...
It is a pity that the international media panic over Ebola is no longer used to talk about the less spectacular but deadlier health crises affecting people in West Africa.
We are ALL threatened.
In every corner of the world, men, women. It's such a sad journalistic article, such a weak headline.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other (equally relevant) contexts: Women are the first caregivers - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc, etc.
So much more intelligent commentary could have been made on the ways, reasons and places where we can all contribute to better understanding and interpreting cultural and sociological approaches, and the differences in the role of the sexes that could help fight Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's start thinking and writing, let's not just make noise.
There's a time for everything.
If you are not able to offer good analysis and intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before writing?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same level as beheading – an equally barbaric form of terrorism, its survival rate only makes it a different form of torture – to say that its temporary suspension is a “light of hope” is beyond comprehension.
By the way - I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which may give some degree of "validity" in his opinion, but in this case obviously it does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I who believed that the Guardian was “maturing” as a global resource for journalism – advancing into the 21st century, abandoning its founding precepts.
Who, in the editorial team, lets that appear?
Money doesn’t count for a local or any other elected official.
I keep reading that the territorial public service is growing, and I've never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
That would be legitimate, indeed.
There will surely be lies and truths, it is up to us to separate the good grain from the weeds.
The Court of Auditors is expensive to tell so much economic nonsense.
It is true that they never had anything to manage the people of Cambon Street.
TBs are not in deficit; they have financing needs that can only relate to and only to the investments they make.
By using concepts too blurred the press as the World plays the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial because it finances investment, collective wealth
Unfortunately, the debt mainly finances operating expenses...
And as the overemployment of civil servants (to make nice roundabouts for example) entails a growing and incompressible burden (compulsory burden until their deaths, since lifelong work + retirement), these communities are taxing in investments.
Therefore, the staffing status should be abolished prior to the reduction of staffing.
It also empowers the mayors financially.
It is fabulous, the intercommunes should have been accompanied by a decrease in the number of communes and it is the opposite that happens, proof that adding one level is not effective without suppressing the others.
How do you properly manage large territories like peanuts in TGV and car time?
The time of the horse where these territories were created is over, it may be time to react.
No, they would rather be imprisoned, worse engulfed, in the administrative canvas, it would appear!
Let's even try garrote, It is not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the state of the Fifth led with its providential men.
It really started with Pétain.
Then it went on to end up with the "breath-taking" series coming up on purpose.
Why aren’t they going to live in a $250 million apartment in Monaco above a movie theater to leave all this suffering behind?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don’t even try the answers like “it’s the whites’ fault.”
"Answers" Not "Answers"
I sincerely hope this is sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn’t obvious enough.
This is what happens when you hurry to be first.
Whether it is sarcasm or not, there is an argument to be made.
We now agree that modern Homo sapiens evolved in Northeast Africa about 200,000 years ago, and during a particularly wet period about 150,000 years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand years) is part of the story.
The current defense minister said a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
He was probably the only one in the government who seemed to hold the road.
Now we know that we can no longer trust him.
Resign!
in 2017:Transformation into a comfortable private hotel of golden cupboards for future retirees of the Republic?
Moving the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the wealthy and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We'll save money and the military will go and treat the last little flu somewhere else...
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all walks of life?
The London Wasps?
I feel sorry for their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They left "London" last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the field of a rugby club instead of the other way around.
In addition, outdoor travel for Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we had the bad luck of being bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once we regained our independence.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training on the ground, although they had access to other premises, did us no favors.
I love Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has a lot of fans and that until recently was at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stadium taken over by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the CCFC's recent problems, but that must be a good slap.
For my part, I’m not club rugby, and to be honest I don’t know anyone who doesn’t do it except a few Wasps fans at work.
They and a few thousand other people in the Southeast will surely follow them from afar or will they now have to support another team?
Nice pro-domo article and good vulgarization.
But who cares?
So why aren’t all computer systems based on these concepts???
+because a gigantic mass of preexisting programs (cobol, java), +because not all systems require them, +because there is no magic wand ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don’t really matter, what matters is to be first in the segment.
The work of G.
Berry's about a niche need.
Mr. Gérard Berry.
One should constantly (the media) such characters, who work for the good of humanity.
For children.
I know them.

But they don’t sell.
Real-time computing has become a key industry in many areas, and few are those who know the intimate details of these processes.
I haven’t been to an olive garden for 15 years.
The value for money has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
It looks like they’re reasoning with Let’s make more profits, not Let’s make healthier dishes at the best value.
They think we're pigeons.
Be careful that people don’t have too much money.
And then we make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there’s plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
You should also add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you need to add to pasta water is negligible, but it greatly improves the taste of the finished product.
It’s not just the taste of salt, it also affects the way pasta is cooked.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there is no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to the corporate kitchen.
Are there family restaurants and do they offer tasty dishes at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
A common accident at work that went wrong.
A promising young thief apprentice was following his father’s career in prison for murder.
A man blurted everything and abruptly interrupted this birth vocation.
That he was sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where else are we going?
Totally agree!
What a humour!
The desire to find out is obvious and difficult to excuse and blame at the same time...
In fact, the desire to escape is hardly excusable.
That’s why I have some sympathy for a 15-year-old.
During the trial, the boy's father complained that he would never see his son again but did not apologize to the relatives of the guy he killed himself.
Who is really the victim in this story?
What do you come to mix everything!!!?
The boy's father was convicted of what he did.
Regarding the bullshit of the lost bullets, the accused and guilty, knew precisely that the bullets are dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the accused!
Let him therefore pay for the crime for which he is responsible!
Ten years is a bit too much in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot at this young man to make noise?
It really made a lot of noise!
If the opportunity arises, go on holiday in the Mosul Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winegrowers.
Twice I have done it, the wine, the scenery and the food are excellent.
Plus, if you’re there during one of the many wine festivals that are held in each municipality, it’s even better.
I'm sorry, the Moselle Valley, I hit too fast.
It’s nice to see that German wine is recognized.
Rather important note, German winemakers traditionally use only one grape variety, which means they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some younger generations experiment with different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
It is not only the region of the Moselle that should be recommended - Franconia, the Rhineland Palatinate (Pfalz), Baden are worth a visit.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are of the German style (or maybe the reverse, in short).
Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink wine after a meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during meals, they now offer a lot of them, and with a much higher alcohol content than their preferred 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines bottled at the property are so complex, the sweetness is superbly balanced.
Try the Schloss Vollrad spatlese with a thermidor lobster the next time you go to the restaurant.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston’s World Atlas of Wine is a good guide, superbly illustrated.
I understand that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover wine, but this is a summary of every newspaper article on German wine since the dawn of time.
From time to time, there is an article about the German wines that are coming up, the new dry ones of Baden that will now accompany the dishes, the reds that are surprisingly vigorous, but most importantly, it is not those disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drank when they were young (oh, I don’t really think it’s ever so evocative).
Closing the Val de Grâce would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the pitiful state in which the Administration of France is located.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and great-uncle who studied there.
In a democracy, public health management should be put to the vote of the Chamber of Deputies: these scoundrels of ministries that are held by the beard, and these decisions made behind closed doors, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin is right.
It should be done as in Sun Green: euthanasia at 70 years old.
Moreover, we could sell the meat that will feed our poor active poor (sic) since they can no longer go to the market.
In reality, find work from our unemployed, real work, and you will no longer have deficit problems!
For the elderly, the time has come to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
The endangered assets will not be able to sustain this demographic transition alone...
So of geriatrics, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospitable model of the glorious 30.
Now, the maximum growth of 1.5% (it has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole model defined after the war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigor and discipline that we know more about in public hospitals.
If this symbol falls, we're really screwed.
First we fucked up because the rest of the hospitals aren't up to it.
The scandal is that presidents and other elites are being treated elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more about increasing the public service offer in other hospitals than keeping a two-speed medicine.
Le Val is a French medical centre of excellence, and of course a symbol.
Closing it would be a mistake, a sign of more of France’s march towards mediocrity.
Not to mention the military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The price of hospitalization day", unit of management of a hospital, is decided by the ministry with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, obviously the baby is just one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country to two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian residents citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why???
It seems to me to be a double standard.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to end all the persecution and abuse and war that drive people from their country and force them to come for help in Australia.
If he does not want people to come by boat, then the problem that generates this traffic must be solved.
I have nothing to complain about in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
This is what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country is back to normal.
It all makes sense now, Nimrod!
It’s strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn’t believe this little hoax when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott.
Cameron denounced the war crimes and abuse that were still taking place.
Several European countries have since suspended deportations of Tamils with ties to the LTTE, believing they would run a risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its asylum assessment guidelines in December 2012, and recommended that people with links to the LTTE be considered at risk upon return.
The year [2013] saw an increase in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
All right, boys!
Mr. Nowak, he's gone so periodically.
In fact, this guy can't get even a chance to make it.
Didn't you have a health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is first, help comes later.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!
A short time ago, we were told that Ebola kills so quickly that a large-scale epidemic was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of those brought back was zero.
The more we are reassured, the more afraid I am.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Low or very low but not zero.
Finally, it is a scientific reality, the more deadly a virus is quickly (in general) the less likely it is to spread because the death of the host signifies its own death.
The combination of the two (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes occurs ex the so-called Spanish flu.
After c is the general quarantine to save humanity. ..
Isn’t there something obscene about pressing brave and virtuous Westerners, but to the detriment of thousands of other African patients whose profession, bravery and virtues are unknown?
Of course, this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repetition of the announcements is a terrifying bias.
Freedom of speech, so much loved by conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers in arms attacking Australian freedom of expression and the right to privacy.
I bet they never imagined that their conservative leanings would rob them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's one that won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, fewer health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A turn of heat for when the problem will actually become out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like that.
Tony Abbott’s refusal to take part in the “war” on Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
Joe Hockey’s plan for a new Medical Research Futures Fund, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely to be just an emergency black box for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, he will raise $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope Australian voters get to see this great trick for what it is.
Tony Abbott is a lot smarter than you think.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is offset by the Futures Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for low-income people.
It may be very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, the "deceitful rodent" and his Telstra Futures Fund were excellent tutors.
If that's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell at the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the “old personality”, tasty.
I also noted it, quite corrosive as a remark.
If only it could dissuade her from keeping a buzz on her constantly..
The worst fate for an end-of-career politician: not being recognized on the street.
She has not been recognized in her city of Toul as being sufficiently up to date to administer it.
What good is “provincial” common sense!
We are living in an abhorrent time, Mrs. Morano.
Of course I am against wearing the burqa, but that is not the point.
What this anecdote tells us is sarkozism in its purest form: from tiny mediocres with ranks of ministers, a confusion between the function of government and the function of execution (if he could, Sarkozy would come with his tonfa on every sign of the road to show that he is well guarded of public order), rudeness and maximization beyond their rightfulness.
I propose that we grant the right to Morano, Sarkozy and all those "old personalities" who have become unattended to wear a gun and a badge, so that they would have every opportunity to exercise their self-proclaimed function of vigilantes.
Who is Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main lesson of the case: even the police have turned the page of Sarkozy, perhaps they do not even regret it.
He really has to stop before it gets embarrassing to him.
I envy this agent who didn't know about Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
Just like Bob, for that matter.
I don’t think it’s funny, because of her...!
Nadine, if it didn't exist, you'd have to invent it!
It's easy though, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
At this point, N.
Morano manifestly did in contempt indeed, in contempt of the police officer she had in front of her, and who probably should have multiplied the curvatures and the "Yes Madame, of course Madame, immediately tell me Madame, in which direction I must run to seize myself without waiting for this veiled woman".
“In one case, the Australian Super Hornets abandoned an airstrike on an ISIS target when the risk of killing civilians became too high.”
The Americans aren’t bad at that, but I still think that Isis is going to overtake them or have already done it, in Iraq at least someone counted the corpses now here nobody does it.
As far as civilian deaths on an industrial scale are concerned, nothing can be compared to the Western war machine.
I disagree that UN sanctions (which include non-Western ones) between the two wars in Iraq would have cost the lives of millions of Iraqis, especially vulnerable children, the elderly and adults.
Most of the anti-war protesters I knew preferred sanctions to the ‘war machine’.
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred sanctions to the order and to the men on the field?
Very good remark - the United Nations has acted incredibly harshly and thoughtlessly in recent years.
The sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite – arguably one reason they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents did not waste time to mark their main enemy when they saw him, in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the HQ of the UN Mission they had erected just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place hard and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cool blood.
As brutal and harsh as this bombing may be, I was surprised by the shock of people knowing that a UN mission was targeted like that.
Good point, I had actually forgotten that.
So add half a million people to the total death toll of Western nations (at least with the recent unrest in Ukraine economic activity was directed directly at the people they intended to injure).
It doesn’t help your argument to exaggerate notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only even vaguely reliable figures on sanctions-related deaths are those of children under 5 and they are even very suspicious since Saddam Hussain refused to let objective inspectors ascertain the facts.
It was obviously in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of the sanctions.
The most reliable estimate that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanction deaths among children under five was about 10 times worse than in the UK, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths is largely biased towards this age group.
Of course you have to fear it, but also the gift of gametes in general.
We must stop pretending that people are pure spirits, that love was all children needed, and that we could do it with strangers that neither the parent nor the child may ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipus, 60% of the French make genealogy.
It is an essential and despised thing to know its origins.
Instead of pretending to be obvious and using fanciful arguments, we should explain what serious problems can arise for an adopted child or conceived with gamete donation.
If you learned that the parents who raised you did not provide the gametes you came from, you could recover, in my opinion, because they would not have committed any crime.
The latest advances in WFP (e.g., uterus transplant) are at least as questionable as a reasonably framed GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: Does the frustration of children’s desire justify these acrobatics and it has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very fair as a point.
It’s obvious that you have to fear the GPA, what is this stupid question?
Of course, it is sad not to be able to have children when you want them.
That's a problem I've had with my wife.
But still, it is less serious than being born very disabled or becoming so, contracting a serious illness, losing all your children in an accident, etc.
Of all the worries of life, this is not the most serious.
This is one frustration among many others.
It does not prevent you from living.
And you can always take care of other people's children!
In a society that no longer endures any form of frustration, where the child becomes a consumer, GPA is unacceptable to me.
Childish desire is not a whim where one could use the other according to one’s will.
Sterility requires reflection and acceptance.
