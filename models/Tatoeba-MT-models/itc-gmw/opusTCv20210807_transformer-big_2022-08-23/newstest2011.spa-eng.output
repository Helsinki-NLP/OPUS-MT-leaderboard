What does it count? The SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop
The new councilors of the SSD in the capital will, it seems, have to overcome the obvious language barriers for the components of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their renewed comrades of the SDGs.
The Aktuáln.cz period "examined" the members of the new SSD Council to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's political flower and cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the best-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand those well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
“The truth is, I don’t know.”
“Rather, I’m a novice in Prague politics,” culture councillor Lukää Kauckä said during the “college” terminology exam.
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, Karel B?ezina reacted the same.
You may know the concept of “golf hole.”
“Maybe it’s the only expression of all of those you’ve asked me about that I use from time to time.”
"If not, I don't usually use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by Aktuáln.cz newspaper last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial staff chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities in Prague.
Socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "going to the pastry shop", "bull's neck", "capital betrayal" and "blinding".
Three councillors agreed to the test and a fourth, Antonin Weinert, who will in future be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, refused directly to do so.
“I don’t get involved in these things and I don’t think I’m going to appreciate how civic Democrats are having fun.”
“What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As it has been seen, supposedly councilman Lukäää Kauckä would not have realized that the above title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of the former mayor Bem, Roman Janouäek.
The word "Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kauck; the only term he got right on the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague."
“It’s about the Blanka tunnel,” says Kauck, who immediately adds: “But rather I know it from the news.”
“I’m going to have to sign up for a language course,” he jokes.
Karel B?ezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the councilor of Environment Luk? Plach?.
Afterwards, both Socio-Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukâ Plachâ even knows where to find that character; in addition, they suspect the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon it is revealed to Plach? that this is the headquarters of the companies in Janou?ek.
Like B?ezina, he indicates that such knowledge got them from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among socio-democrats.
“I asked my classmates, but it really seems like we don’t have anything like it.”
“Rather, we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or play word games with names,” says the president of the Prague SSD, Petr Hulínsk, whose partymates call Hulda.
“In school they called me B?za, but I don’t know if my classmates also call me that,” says his own nickname Karel B?ezina.
The newspaper Aktuáln.cz tested the name and it works.
To his partymates, Weinert is D?da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D?dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the election deceptions during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igr?ek" ("playmobil") from some of his comrades.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínsk? doesn't like to be called Hulda, but the Aktuáln?.cz newspaper even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of the rights of the cocks" apparently remembers that Petr Hulinsk obtained his doctorate in Law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", according to a leaflet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually of advanced age, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who “return” to witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men seldom suffer such but."
“Healthy young women are not isolated either, because they help in the labors and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso, takes care of a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual “social measure”.
He issued an information leaflet that should help prevent witch hunts.
However, this has a drawback.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” warns the newspaper Die Standard about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, last week Ammy Hemmah, 72, died when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate cluster of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman stuck in the oil that is used for ritual anointing.
It caught on fire when the group wanted to "expel evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: “Human soul eaters have always been a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
“Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that allegedly had been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself through black magic.”
“To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, forcibly took randomly chosen men and women from among the Gambian peoples to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
On the estate, the arrested people had to drink a pot of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay on the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand people.
Bakala tenant: warms up with charcoal stoves and signs higher rent
The man, old and old, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnate" Zdexek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he was carrying documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is serving sentence.
All three of them have just taken advantage of the rent liberalization.
Instead of 3,500 Czech kronor per month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 kronor for a two-room flat with a separate second-class kitchen.
"Furthermore, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in the new contract of his son, over whose signature he has full powers.
“But I signed it,” he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But, in this case, the man only makes one move.
“Everyone says something,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major testing laboratory for liberalization.
After the New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
That’s why Aktuáln.cz decided to visit the “laboratory” in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of the four of Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine o’clock, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and beside them a machine to pick up the number.
"Rent 2011", can be read on a light button of your touch screen.
When you press it, a little paper with a number comes out of the machine.
It hardly gives time to read "157" and already the number appears on the big screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Soon after, an elderly couple arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for settlements, insurance issues, and the like.
Letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava at the tenants’ mailboxes for most of the 44,000 RPG-owned flats around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes a rental increase of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
“It’s been working for a week, so it’s starting,” respond, after briefly doubting, the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and Bakala’s old mining floors are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were treated loud and clear by the vice-president of parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the SSD, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
“Neither did I change the damn bathroom dish,” the man mentioned in the introduction vents.
According to the workers, for the time being, retirees come to check if they receive a discount on rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract by December 15 will also receive half of the February rental discount.
However, the window of mining “liberalization” certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
“Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people were asked about the rental in 2011,” she said.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rent, an independent judge will have to settle the matter.
“This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed and completely in accordance with the law,” RPG warns on its pages.
“You’re not going to judge anyone here,” says one of the Byty RPG employees, and a man standing on the street in front of the customer service center gives her, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a 13,000 pension and I have 5,000 left for food; I don’t have the means to go to court,” he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
“Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people wait,” he says.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
“Current rents still don’t cover even the amounts needed to maintain the community fund,” recalls Pavel Klima, director of RPG Byty’s residential portfolio, adding that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for landlords, the main reason to increase rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest four billion in apartments, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlights in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
“In addition, there will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech kronor per square meter,” it says on the screen.
Only increase by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19.66 kronor per square meter,” RPG says.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not affect rents suddenly, but will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rise of the rent (see the graph) again on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the lease hike agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need childcare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with everything appropriate to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to it.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from which many well-known buildings from Brno came out, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-kindergarten.
About 90 people work at the company, mainly in the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the nursery is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers to its workers as part of its social program.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-kindergarten was an idea of the Arch.Designu employees themselves and, with the support of management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-kindergarten is financed through the European Social Fund under the Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme, as well as the Czech Republic’s state budget.
Thanks to the funding provided (more than 2.8 million CZK) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When funding runs out (two years), Arch.Design is required to keep the mini-kindergarten running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the submission of the funding request.
The care of the children is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The nursery currently welcomes children without age limit, although most of them are under three years old.
Since it is a "mini-child care", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with the shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to suit the needs of parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-kindergarten program are comparable to the usual preschool education program.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach to English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up children late from school when away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of personnel.
The House of Bones continues to fascinate after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur, and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its skeleton-like shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones."
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of the scales and the omnipresent lines gently curved, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, you observe a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Snake and the twisting of the shapes continues to surprise us also inside.
Corrugated wood copies window frames, railings, door ornaments, mirrors, and signs.
Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample neighborhood at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gràcia, emerged from the refurbishment of a house from the year 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of carrying out a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated on the design.
In fact, in their project plans arose ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in Casa Batlló’s proposals was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Milá and Gaudí’s Park Güell, where other pieces of it are found.
Due to its organic shape, the locals shortly after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawning".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the building hide religious motifs.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the time of central heating with vents and typical fireplaces.
It can be strange its inclination of forty-five degrees.
During construction, Gaudí did not respect the building rules of the moment and did not allow himself to be influenced by them.
Still, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, after its completion, the town hall was so impacted with the result that it requested that it be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the request of the town hall, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor were the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted in breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of the connection of space.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the lounges and a larger group can communicate in this way without any hassle, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only got a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with the two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the sun’s rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most recharged apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the famous creator’s birth.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and they expanded visits to the common area and the loft, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of entry to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and the socks: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really gives its quality to a good bed is the surface for lying down, that is, the mattress and the basement.
First of all, they must be complemented perfectly so that they adapt to the specific users.
During the selection come into play numerous items including the weight, height, health and sex of the owner.
It is also important the type of interior in which the mattress and the basement are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that doesn’t usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they “heat” more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them around more often.
If the center channels are not properly aerated and, above, are on a firm basis, they keep moisture inside.
When it comes to choosing a bed, habits also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
“Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"These types of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have time problems with the nervous system, so they receive bad information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other clients, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and Magniflex Italians, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This “miracle” works in a very simple way.
Optimizes your stiffness and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not spin like after a hard match.
It just sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when lying face up, you should have your hands comfortably shrunken towards the elbows," advises the engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert of Cechu ?alouník? to decoratér, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, a subject that specializes in schools.
In double rooms, each needs its own pillow and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the baseboards at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interior a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
“When you touch it with your hand or when you sit on the mattress, you certainly shouldn’t notice the springs,” warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of mattress.
Fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and you can’t wash their case, which is often done today.
And, since we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat each night, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) screen.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, the sellers give a tip: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of cleaning and washing the cover, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers with zip closure are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when they are opened they are left in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a broomstick, do you have a firm board?
Never!
As much as for the beds designed to spend one night the visits.
However, you should make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes on the table and you should use it with a mattress with springs on the inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulate sheet beds containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although it is always better to have a bed bed with a higher number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar zone are reinforced and their rigidity can be adjusted.
Articulable sheet pads should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to recline.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "round" the shoulders perfectly during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is very important.
Even the manufacturers of mattresses remember them, who, in the "males", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are pads with cross or tablet structure with the so-called multitorsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that, even if you use the right mattress and basement, if you use a bad (big and "soft") pillow, most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can relax.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on your side, the pillow should be on the same level (when combined with the shoulder backing or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are in fashion.
Petroleum-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually every known manufacturer uses soybeans.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Va?ek of the company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "cool" with vegetable extracts of breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the cover.
The red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more warmth.
Favorites currently?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam stiffnesses make it possible to manufacture mattresses from various zones that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you 7,000 crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as a means of health.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and footbeds.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is free.
The era of viscoelastics with an open cell structure and high density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
It initially emerged as material for NASA, because during takeoffs the astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Consequently, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for medical devices, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More Parents Use People Tracking Devices to Control Their Children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for tracking vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anishka Janatkova.
At the moment the device is about the size of a box of cherries, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Anishka and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
“We all try to tell ourselves that it is not about spying, but another means of reducing the chances of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone's bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet come across such cases."
“Most customers actually buy it for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bozhkova warns of the fact that if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even the youngest children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled by them.”
“Parents used to rely heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” Boková says.
In his opinion, it is debatable whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
“If it’s a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check if the child is carrying any kind of electronic device that can reveal their location.”
“Now it’s the phone.”
"As the use of the tracking devices becomes more widespread, it will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be done with a lot of advertising."
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the event of an impromptu attack by a pedophile.
According to RC Monitoring’s Robert Cech, who offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even in the event that the tracking device is destroyed immediately after an attack, his presence can help.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If it suffers damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The more expensive devices have a built-in tilt gauge, so if the person simply slips and sits still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says Dr. Ech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, on which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a size similar to a box of matches or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, that’s why tests are currently being done with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or identify him after a while, which can make the police save time," he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will still use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to encircle all of Czechia.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to catch explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the shelf life of the wick is two years, at most four.
The army bought the explosives wick from the STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
The General’s staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick by saying that soldiers need 60 kilometers of wick a year for training maneuvers.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, with whom MF DNES was contacted, however, it is decided that, in such a case, such maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, senior officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want to be exempted either by Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and Army Captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could the army be justified in spending 60 kilometers of wick.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
If so, the army would have sufficient stockpiles for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
Soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently personally complained to Minister Vondra because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even money-related shooting practices are limited.
And let’s not talk about the lack of underwear.
“I also don’t get to understand that they repeatedly buy us such amounts of wick.”
“But it’s their decision, and they’ll certainly know why they act like that.”
“For us, the military is a good customer that we try to satisfy as a company,” admits STV Group’s commercial director, Jan Däck.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejchek defends the hundreds of kilometers of mecha by also saying it will have stockpiles of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Däck, of STV Group, indicates that the wick only has a shelf life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, of two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
At the end of its life, each munition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of mecha, he got a discount.
“They cost us 60 percent less than last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” Pejcek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense’s shopping center, said.
Just to compare: the annual wick consumption of the police pyrotechnicians, who remove the munitions from World War II or left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always only ask for the right amount to deplete the ammunition before its shelf life runs out.
They decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable wick types can be obtained.
The ministry is already struggling to finish tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians MF DNES spoke to, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: you will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I am still living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Lukâ Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
The last edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukâ Pytloun of Liberec.
His success story seems to come from a movie.
Lukâ Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered with seasonal jobs abroad and a credit from the bank he bought a half-destroyed five-story house.
Considering that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
“At present, the value for money of the accommodation in our area has pushed me to do something about it,” says Lukâ Pytloun.
He started renting the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income he earned he invested back in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in business, he managed to gradually open in Liberec four guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
“We’ve just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we’ve sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” he said.
“This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels greatly helped to win the ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ contest,” Pytloun added.
Victory increased his fame and popularity in and around Liberec.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” she recalls.
I definitely recommend everyone who wants to try a company that participates in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live on contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"With some people that I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
Totally about seventy.
“I’ve seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that has gained general recognition.”
"It's not my own personal success, it's the result of the hard work of the whole team."
“It’s just my name that appears on the foreground,” Luká Pytloun modestly says today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated from the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel Arsk, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone contest "Company of the Year", last year at the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in ?eská Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition,” says the winner last year.
The story of Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the state proposed to Karel’s father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of properties during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialist public after achieving success in the media competition.
“Not only did our customers begin to see the Farmet brand as considerably better, but foreign partners also began to value the collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country,” says Karel Ársk?.
Last year perhaps it was not just a display of the euphoria of victory in Farmet.
It also gained recognition for commercial results until 2008 and, partially, in 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year for selling machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
“We obviously don’t get rid of that either.”
“Income fell by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs,” explains Karel Arsk.
A viable company must, at times, take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and kept the company’s profits, even if it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
“With the grants, we have built a research and training centre, strengthened our presence on the international market and obtained magnificent valuations at national fairs,” says Ársk?.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are rising again, and with them, the number of new employees.
“The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel Arsk.
A survey that reveals ridiculous norms
The Absurdity Survey of the Year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity Survey of the Year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested an extract from the mercantile register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
“The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the trade register when carrying out a check of the insured’s impositions,” Jana Buraková, a spokeswoman for SSZ, said in a statement.
The objective of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
For the fourth time this year, he is part of the Hospodăské noviny business tournament, and he is also starting to create a passion among the general public.
While last year’s edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, this year it practically reached 4,000.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
“Perhaps in the number of papers needed for the tax return we are in the first place worldwide,” says Karel Havl?ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation improves especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for owning a company, Czech Republic ranks 74th, i.e. eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic nonsense every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "anti-award" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
He wins the nonsense that gets the most votes.
For this year’s survey more than one hundred, in particular 105 rules and regulations that do not make sense, were presented.
The examples were sent by both businessmen and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year’s 70 proposals is published on the page of the contest.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square, is part of an event that usually involves personalities from the political and social world.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kusel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic, attended this event.
“Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state continually hinders entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in the water of drunkenness.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the obligation of the employer to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, intending to go with a position to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that finished second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. communication to the labor office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was removed in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third one is won.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
So this year, the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the contest of Hospodaské noviny is the category called Responsible company of the year 2010.
The purpose of this contest is to support responsible and fair companies.
“In this way, we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone’s mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of the main contest of Vodafone Enterprise of the year 2010 were presented companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between them, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example the disabled, in others the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of funds to sponsor children with disabilities for seven years.
There is a stationery in Podabrad that is especially concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the workforce; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the contest Vodafone Company of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which cut working hours even below the 35-hour weekly average without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce as little impact as possible on the environment,” explains businesswoman Miluse Ryznarová.
The IT company responsible Enlogit of the region of Isti also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them a chair and ergonomic keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and at its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Person in Trouble grant, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the company's representative.
The Praní laundromat company is also well-placed with a mention to the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive special bonuses that have an impact on their pension funds.
“We provide benefits in food, transportation, skills improvement and leisure,” says Josef Strapá, from Bruntál Czasch’s construction company, a winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of Company Responsible for the Year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest were automatically appointed who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
Organizers removed incomplete or incorrect forms from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company contest of the year, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company contest of the year."
“Individual applications for this contest are not allowed, as this is a subcategory of the Company’s main contest of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose Advisory.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police have made several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Lubo G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an on-going public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land was received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay Lubo-G. half a million crowns for it.
“At the moment I can only say that police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender,” Antonie Zelená, chief prosecutor of Pilsen, told Právo, adding that she could not disclose further details about the ongoing investigation at the moment.
Twenty-four hours later, police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On how it could influence the public auction, given the little official information, can only be speculated.
The spokesperson for the Lubomíra Cherná Agricultural Fund responded to Právo’s questions by saying that police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
“This is a client, not one of our employees,” he said.
The public auction is called "Call for Land Transfer Proposals in accordance with the Land Law" and is conducted when various stakeholders appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a higher value than their return, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
“Based on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest offer,” the Fund spokeswoman said.
Lubo-G. had information on who was going to run for the call and, since he was an interested person because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, it was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of his arrest, he had so much money on him.
Lubo G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of the FP Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo G. has just obtained from the Fund some land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular in the place where a large road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Afterwards, he exchanged them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the very historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because otherwise, the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns a month more than they do now, starting in January.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by about 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The increase in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 kronor more a year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers cut prices, as support for energy production from renewable sources, particularly photovoltaics, has increased.
However, the gas is moderately expensive, especially when heating is used the most and, therefore, the higher the consumption.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are being priced across the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, homes in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 more crowns per month from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 more crowns per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially in case the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Praguens will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will still be among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be 7.4% higher.
Rental prices for 450,000 rented flats in Prague can be considerably increased, where regulation will end in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 flats in Istanbul, will increase rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take to court those who disagree with the new lease.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase next year by as much as 10%.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer so, because it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
Those are the drinks that cause young drinkers to end up in medical care under the age of 15.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome hangover are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of physicians who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get them drunk."
“Fashion is now strong alcoholic beverages,” says the head of paediatrics at Ho?ovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Lud?k Pelikán, to Právo.
"When they manage to get a bottle from their casserole father, it may be whisky, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
“Vodka has the advantage that it lightens with juice and doesn’t smell so much,” he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokesperson of the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
“These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren.”
“In some cases, they use brandy that they picked up at home,” Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, 13- and 14-year-old drinkers are usually seen in hospitals.
Prior to Ho?ovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
“A girl had to come in maybe four times.”
"It began at age 12, when she was brought with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, plus an ecstasy mix," the department's doctor said of the case.
"He was at Holeșovice's fair at some dance party."
“What’s interesting is that his mother wasn’t even surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours,” he said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot speak properly of dependence.
“An alcoholic is a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children.”
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” explains Chief Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, this year 40 drunk children were hospitalized at the Motol pediatric clinic until mid-November.
However, statistics only show those who come with serious poisoning and should remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the walking medical examination, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink brandy, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs to mention: the day of witches, New Year’s Eve and the end of school.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for the bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
“On Witch’s Day I have seen up to seven drunk children at once in admissions,” adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that are lacking in the body.
"These take it much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and they don't hurt at all."
“They’re only confused about where they are,” Pelikán says, adding that patients often lose their mood at least when they see the expenses they’ve generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients comes to cost tens of thousands of crowns.
“I’ve often used the cost as a means of educating them, when in the visit I tell them directly to the children how much their intoxication has cost and that they would have to spend all summer in a job for young people to earn enough to pay for themselves that night,” adds Pelikán.
Health insurance, in your opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for treatment costs, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft found for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time such a device has been in the hands of anyone other than the Czech Army.
At the moment, they were only abroad to perform internship or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seater version L-159T1, which until now was used by the Czech army and was still in flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seater aircraft.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, already took over them last week.
Jan Pejek, of the defense press department, says it is not yet known when Vodochody’s planes will physically be withdrawn.
“The L-159 single-seater aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, with no additional investment or input from the Ministry.”
“The L-159T1 two-seaters were exchanged in their current state,” he told Právo Pejak.
He added that the army does not run out of twin-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for the amount of 200 million kronor for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for twin-seaters.
One of the new planes was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered later this year.
According to Pejaek, EADS pledged to add the planes to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for the pilot practices of NATO countries."
“So it’s up to the buyer to decide how he’s going to use them in this framework,” says Pejaek.
The Hospodashské noviny newspaper published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army was not interested in the L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense management claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159s abroad.
The Czech army acquired 72 Aer aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
Buying home aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already sued the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the planes by conducting a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa aircraft and the last one is expected to arrive at the Prague airport in Kbely in fourteen days.
An index finger longer than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the ring finger are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that relative finger length may be a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to age 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should have a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other detrimental factors, such as family health problems, Eeles said.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had their right hand index finger shorter than their ring finger.
They were as likely to have prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pases, told TK that he knows the study, but that he doesn’t think the relationship between finger length and cancer can be “fully demonstrated.”
The Czech Republic in the snow: the D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, was snow-covered on Thursday.
Roads and sidewalks are mostly covered by compact snow and snow removal machines circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as well as the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was broadcast by the operator of the automotorklubu (AMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck broke down, in 93 two commercial vehicles collided that caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the yard.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks collided.
Drivers must drive slowly after Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and join kilometer 182 in K valce.
There were several miles of traffic jams.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7oC.
Traffic jams are forming in Prosek, for example, although it is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo namistí and Námistí Míru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check what the current situation is.
The airport was closed from 11 p.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Currently, it can be driven on most roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
Three secondary roads are closed to traffic, snow tongues are being formed in Brno and chains are needed in Blanenska to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the hardest hit places was Vykovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucererov and also Tharatice - Milețovice.
To dispose of them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment it is not possible to say when they will open up to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region that, because it is a protected natural area, simply have to be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to TK.
In the Czech Republic they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfall is gradually receding in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military is using a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and “change the progress of the game” to victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with extremely precise aiming.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25mm calibre ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosives load it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when hitting the target, but at any point on its ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, wall, or trench.
No doubt, you can’t use normal protection, and when you throw your killer shower of metal chips, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use “smart” technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it its laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains an accurate point of view and, depending on it, corrects the line of projection and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
“When the trigger is pressed, the weapon loads and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters,” Audette said.
400 jobs are being relocated.
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will shift their workplace from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance sector giant announced on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term another 100 employees of the consortium, which were previously scattered throughout the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office at Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, “At Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region provoked joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt’s chief economics officer, Markus Frank (CDU), said he had won a “Global Player.”
This is a “magnificent recognition of the location.”
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu’s decision.
The management informed the city earlier about his intention.
“We have of course offered the company our help,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons caused the fall.
In such a way, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous post.
“I hope the owner and landlord of the building are cooperative.”
The property previously used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" had been part of the remaining buildings at Marienbader Platz for ten years in a controversial construction project for the spa town.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which takes care of the criticism in terms of the massive building that previously used the spaces as parking spaces and in terms of the level of the buildings.
In 2001, investment consulting and appraisal companies were installed, the manufacturer of Software for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then merged Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-born Fujitsu consortium is recognized as the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides precise services.
The branch office in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is established from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the next subsidiaries here will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That’s why they’ve rented 7,000 square meters in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central electrotechnical association and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anxiety is increasingly taking hold of WikiLeaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the revelations platform from its server.
Possibly behind is political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is reportedly detained in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, ever-stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former US server and are now seeking a homeland of the internet in Europe.
US Senator Joe Lieberman calls for a boycott of WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks ejected from Amazon server."
“Speaking freely in the land of freedom,” activists said on Twitter on Wednesday.
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had deleted the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to publishing secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon services website in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks explained: “Perfectly, we’re going to spend our dollars on hiring people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, they “should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Sen. Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the Guardian reported.
“I had wanted Amazon to take these steps earlier, prior to the previous releases of classified information through Wikileaks,” he said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
“WikiLeaks’ illegal, monstrous and reckless process puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world,” the senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently called the investigation in Sweden a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there had been threats in London.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why he fears for Assange’s safety, Hrafnsson said.
The location of the WikiLeaks founder remains unrevealed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to the North American statements.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, claimed that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations should be tried for treason and should be executed.
In Canada, an adviser to the head of government Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange there is a big dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had asked for the secretary of state's resignation, in case she was responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage tasks.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and this country’s interests are much stronger than its website.”
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution for the National Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed as an exceptional commissioner, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing “important structural reforms” that are necessary in light of the WikiLeaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
“We have done everything we can to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are prepared to help protect them if necessary.”
The University of Ice Cream
In the "Gelato University" in Bologna ice cream parlors are prepared in the best times of the year.
The basic three-day course for future ice cream parlours has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
From the ice cream parlor and the ice cream parlor.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The ice cream maker takes out the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the barrel and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic three-day course for future ice cream parlours has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special more-day courses on chocolate ice cream and practices in the home’s own ice cream parlor.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk in the soft ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a California art teacher, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years in an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of their bars’ ice cream, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or the cream cover of the national and mainly southern top house of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently cools it down to four degrees.
Then it opens the machine’s faucet and comes out with a pasteurized white basic cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without stallionizer?
How can you let go of some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises you to get rid of the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream "not just natural ingredients", has perhaps used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar bean.
Of course you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a sonic granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit or sweets section of the supermarket.
Also, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"Yet they must experience it sometime."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Course participants can now use the freezers.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better doesn’t necessarily depend on whether it has more toffee flavor or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to taste nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the adored kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced blend highlights the flavor of the ice cream, Luciano says.
Making ice cream is an artimetic problem: Peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, you have to reduce the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the types of fruit (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easy to count.
Making ice cream does not require more than the physical application, as before.
Not only does the tool help for the automatic processing of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to temperature below zero.
In spite of everything, all the automation is left out as far as the small pasta is concerned.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if she were an uncontrolled mini-first giant.
“In every course,” says Master Luciano, “it is only a matter of time that something like this happens.”
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has infiltrated the industry that experiments with GMO plants.
Currently this issue is formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” Testbiotech director Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, and another EFSA expert have also been hired by the Ilsi Association for years.
Consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the EFSA testing standards of genetically modified plants, placing him in a clear conflict of interest.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
So, recently, a high-ranking EFSA manager went without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side with that.
Recently, the Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which was carried out by the General Environment Office as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some from the industry, as long as they are of high and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without researching animal feed and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how are they going to be found?" he asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
She has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this field, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not usually published.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck maintains.
The Trace of Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind him.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is well known: In September the excavators arrived and began to shoot down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was made rubble.
It rotates in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
“These stones are relics.”
"They shouldn't disappear."
He is enthusiastic: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he's going to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tübingen in a former ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“There would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or send it to the dump,” he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the company of shootdowns.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the shooting.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the massif of 80 kilos cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half are still in the woods, the rest have long since been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from all over and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top of it.
The Stuttgart stone of impulse has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“This stone is really nothing special,” says Rongen.
“If it weren’t for the political component.”
He ascends to his all-terrain, takes a tour of his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, became interested in computers and eventually worked with stones.
He is a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the country’s largest antique stone trader.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic minced sandstones.
“They belonged to the Dresden bridge Marienbrücke,” he explains.
White limestone, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Point out a lot: Red sandstone, an anterior piece of the Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
"Nice travertine."
Formerly the dungeons belonged to the tribune of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police station, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, drum from Heilbronner’s hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple rig and a cart, he feels very devout.
“It would be a scandal if something were destroyed.”
He has not become rich, not at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to the stoneworker, besides stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man who takes advantage of the remains.
Soon you will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting talents around great potential
There is an active influx into the buffet.
16 students huddle around the lollipops, tomato soup and candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a sort of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, gather in a melee fight around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: To hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And since universities don’t provide publications about their students’ skills, they try to catch exceptional talents on practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium is won by talents.
A young lady from the staff department delivers pens, erasers and folders with the VW logo.
Explains to the excited young talents internship programs and student jobs and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
“In turn, VW can meet students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
“The main point previously was in the technical projects,” Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not, they have to advertise themselves and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacancies in October.
And, according to the VDI’s forecasts, this vacuum of engineers will grow even further.
At the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincan, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. the following year.
Participants can also look at KPMG’s subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the start.
Only the cream of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to pick and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
“The simple journey by itself was short.”
For the Dykta scout, the grades give results.
"To date we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
“Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also on the hunt, especially small and medium-sized companies, classic with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students to trade shows."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, staff manager for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company’s website.
“It’s very difficult to fill vacancies.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
“Professors advise that you can do internships with us or do your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That’s why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium can’t normally offer it,” says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the preconditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in her ranking for her job applicants.
“I think the applicant pays special attention to the external classifications of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Employer Branding internal, also promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
When you treat people well and identify yourself with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” Kriegler says.
Obama halts new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico no new oil drilling has appeared in recent years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and unappealingly overturned its previous plans.
Also off the Atlantic coast remain new sealed perforations for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What triggered this strict ban, which will be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the “Deepwater Horizon” oil rig in April.
Prior to the disaster that claimed the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted to new drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
An investigation commission commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the moratorium on drilling after the explosion.
Subsequently, various petrol consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently the responsible supervisory authority, which after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is reformed from the root.
Obama is also announcing that the lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the gulf will be lower thanks to tighter regulation, to date.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries,” says the result of the current survey conducted by the advisory firm BDO – ahead of Wednesday’s extraction ban.
American Energey Alliance complains of insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are soon running out, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
River water is oil marble, it smells like a petrol station: Millions of liters of oil spilled have shattered nature in Nigeria’s Ogoniland.
People live off the theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari seems fine.
“Don’t get tired,” the environmental activist reassures reporters: “Today enough oil will pass before your eyes.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water up to their chest with the glow of lights reflected in surface turbulence: With the colorful glow of water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that on the surface there are brown spots of oil.
Previously, he used to take shrimp in handcuffs, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
Fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinking regions in the world.
In the path of the river path that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship’s engine removes a brown broth, which immerses its hand in the water, will draw a few full of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the colliding palms and hanging their palms.
In vain flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the outside barrier is silenced, a sort of ghostly calmness of an earlier paradise with the smell of a petrol station expands into it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," says, furious, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to our health."
We need a war comparison.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a tough battleground for years: Here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first Shell consortium factory in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Businesses are still banned from returning to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold were being pumped daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters steel platforms protruded like strange sculptures of water: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drillers.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, then a steady stream of oil pours into the water.
According to expert assessments, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the crash of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the long-lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see leaky heads and pipes as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mostly low safety standards normally in the conventional world, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only pipe defect rates are "over a multiple larger than elsewhere."
In a place, which from afar seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures appear between the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the drilling, sometimes scattered arbitrarily on the ground, there is a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the group’s head.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipe leaks out and eventually comes out of diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-litre diesel daily: "It gives us 34,000 naira", about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", who hacked the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this step, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost per day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only an insignificant part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the best part in cages and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate over whether the environmental catastrophe is due to population management or the lax mode of production to be purely academic.
“If oil companies didn’t behave like invaders and didn’t completely destroy the fish’s natural habitat, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the ogoni are mostly shattered by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as the Chinese."
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says muscular Olmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the special unit of the army catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This doomed invention has completely torn our country apart,” Akpobari says.
Researchers Detect Dangerous Factory Defects in A380 Engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce “a catastrophic engine failure.”
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing at the beginning of November were far luckier than you might imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s through their investigations, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court in Sydney that made more legal action against the company possible.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline would claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the brand of the engine have lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will carry out more safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily on land.
Lufthansa restarted the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Nevada Across the Country Causes Traffic Chaos
Totally white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed almost all over the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Almost across the country reached freezing temperatures on Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a 15 centimeter thick layer of snow.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snow removal is in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong winds sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
Germany’s Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects live tides with water levels 1.2 meters above their usual level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There is partly 30 centimeters of fresh snow and cold and strong winds are in charge of swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped overnight.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported major street disturbances.
On the A2, snow and wind stalled traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia the snowfall affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major upheavals are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thüringen and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on lanes or broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service attended to the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
Snowy winds sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokeswoman for Fraport, there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The snowshoes are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 field beds prepared for them.
On many streets, Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a road junction in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to the snowy streets: Here, too, a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the journey from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after turning over her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: Snow will become softer and dusty and will therefore swirl in soft streaks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for buyers for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutsche Bank arranged its headquarters: The twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district were modernized; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the renovation, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, according to the Financial Times Deutschland.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the proposed sale.
“We always check whether to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again,” he said.
That’s why Germany’s largest credit institution relinquishes its company headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for €272 million from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
The energy reforms reached figures of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would mean a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper’s towers renamed as “Greentowers” at around 500 million euros.
Whether refurbished buildings are sold to a bank fund or to an independent investor has not currently been revealed, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
Yet the bodies have not been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Nearly two weeks ago, there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced to the site of misfortune, but no sign of survival was found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could be lowered for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Families and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative event.
Ten thousand people have changed with the resplendent brightness of the sun in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They remain silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the miners’ helmets, lamps and names.
There were also photographs and personal belongings, underneath clothing and surfboards.
Flags waved at half-mast in front of the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand waited for miners to return to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand government president John Key told participants at the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot take on his son’s death until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Alongside the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on November 19, British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, the scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, Gary Knowles, the police chief, told reporters.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does Gore fit into the artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn once again explores the boundaries of the genre with his epic battle epic “Walhalla Rising.”
Which audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and tear his enemies from their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of grievous deadly screams.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain scenery of Scotland, which the backstage offers to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm chamber movements.
When a film has multiple groups of recipients it is a pity that they cannot rule each other out.
Director Winding Refn regards his savages and the “Pusher” trilogy as some sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with a little more mainstream humor or a little less artist-house brutality.
A brain mass and sprouting guts can’t deter most fans of artistic cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo catches a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck an eternity in calm and fog before his team arrives in America and again shuts up there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, there is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
There is no escape for the spectators.
Refn contemplates just a moment of relaxation and his glacier images and the grim trance soundtrack make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only one young blonde, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior from hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, altered and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The nuclear energy organization IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
On the midnight of September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that apparently the Syrians built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that comes out of the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA in late April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the el-Kibar vicinity very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves any other purpose than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from the inside.
It was not long ago that the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is hardly more known than at the time, the puzzles got bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack the CIA was completely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but that he saw little indication that there was a “nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several Secret Service agents prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack solid evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor ahead of us, a senior U.N. diplomat lapidarily replied in the summer that the IAEA has “sufficient material to have questions.”
The Syrians quickly cleared the debris of the alleged “unused military building” and thoroughly raided the ground.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the command of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial vendors at the time of the attack, which must have a higher information value than that presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria always hinted that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after particle analyses.
Since then, Damascus has refused to argue about it, as well as about satellite imagery.
In addition, controllers are prohibited from a second inspection at el-Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps strict silence.
“We will never comment on it,” Ehud Olmert, the prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "is progressively transformed into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds with a place at the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious infringement against the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, under the watch of the IAEA, is pending.
The IAEA sees three more equipment as the key to progress in clarification, which must be “functionally connected” to the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not publicly disclosed until now what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated as intern Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these places and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
Possibly located at or immediately next to a military base, Syria forbids entry to all three sites to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on the military plants.
Nuclear detectives have been alert to the equipment thanks to the warnings of the U.S. Secret Service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three sites and the bucket on the bank of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be “related to fuel production.”
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities", neither uranium enrichment nor refurbishment; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is driven with uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium for the bombs should subsequently be separated, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
Since the hundreds of truck loads disappeared from the ground, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The IAEA considers the salt mine al-Tibni, located a few kilometers from el-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates River, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its ability as an area for radioactive waste, unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in a satellite imagery analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show Syrians made land movements in the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be accidental, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months developing an inspection plan there, which the Syrians allowed, to keep the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors’ interest.
Meanwhile, Damascus is also critical of this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador fencing so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish the controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: Most of the IAEA Governing Council is needed for this, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly looking forward to an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: "And what if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie began in summer with the direction of her yet-unnamed debut.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Much more is not known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women’s associations quickly protested, at the last minute moving some planned filming days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victims organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She is not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
No love stories are given in the rape camps, and Jolie's stance on the subject tells the victims enough about the script.
Her organization according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended dismissing Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, gave after a strip and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go after all.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she enters the Yugoslav conflict with great effort, she wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content is still inaccurate.
A second synopsis of the film circulates on the web, which sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the war began and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim of rape falls in love with torturer".
Jolie’s film really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
They can now make peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here
This afternoon is good for the Irish.
No trace of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans shout with joy as they hum the music loudly, hitting the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the Southlander Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters.
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world championship of beerpong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quirky drinking game and the understated computer don't actually make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, distract himself from the fulminating question, what the future will hold.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
“It’s far from home and I still don’t have a job there.”
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "one shot got his dream job as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in London.
Young people leave: There are many families like the Tanners on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, economics experts and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin predict.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A big loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, comes a wave of migration comparable to that suffered the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses, above all, the young, well-trained Irish, for whom until now everything is uphill.
The job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "Everything is sinking in Ireland."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future appear because the government only engages in montages and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to get new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
Notice how your peers go from non-embedded practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
“This idea is sad and depressing.”
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade show that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
“For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career,” says the manager.
His website contains photos of a boy surfing in Australia and a boy snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it involves freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now they are setting up a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he will go to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O’Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to be able to pay for credit for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a little crazy,” he says, as it’s a long time since he first stepped on the threshold of his house.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m never so good.”
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes into icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent funded by a credit.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he said.
“Working abroad isn’t the worst thing that can happen, maybe it makes us feel like Irish for the first time.”
He laughs and tells of his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future hanging and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He’s been working in London for a couple of years now, and why wouldn’t he and his girlfriend be doing well in New Zealand?
But these days there’s one thing he’s really worried about: celebrating his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could degenerate into a farewell party.
“Just, not too much emotion,” he says and drinks his beer.
"Goodbye, it sounds very distressing."
"We'd better call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private companies.
Crime raises more concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor reigning in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has risen from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably above the 25% recorded in 2001 (Chart 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted their country’s Congress and 45 per cent their Government, the same number as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis is probably because many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only marginally increased in 2009 and that it has fallen again this year, to 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem their country faces (see Chart 5).
About 31% say they or a close relative have been a victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has fallen from 38% last year and is the lowest percentage on record since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private companies and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private companies are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% support private companies), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the garbage
No one expected the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, it went much worse than the feared by foreigners trying to help the country recover from its problems.
Votes were cast at the ballot boxes, some people voted multiple times, ballots cast in the sewers, polling stations destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Electoral colleges opened hours late.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, declared that they were “relatively good elections in many ways.”
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which its opponents say is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tiebreaker is expected to take place in January.
All hope for the election has not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Célestin, who barely has support, if he has any, has moved on to the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic ravages the country and more than one million of the earthquake survivors still live in stores, a large abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the choice of a popular and legitimate government to be an essential step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And, as it turns out, so do the Haitians themselves.
Heading forward towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernandez, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
However, whether it can turn him into a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s election will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernandez leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who was still in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of making budgets that underestimated fiscal revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following Kirchner’s death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some discrepant members of the Peronist movement in power have confronted Ms. Fernandez.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
The 2010 budget, therefore, will apply next year, which will give the president even more room to spend it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but many private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, place it at about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made the INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez change these policies now?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18 percent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is why Ms. Fernandez is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring that Argentina had not repaid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Ms. Fernandez is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is customary.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems like the prelude to the cleanup of INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernandez wants to remain in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown weary of Kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, with peace of mind, many of your husband’s policies.
Half a Hurrah for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of those eligible, came on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councilors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become an advocate for feelings for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PDP), which has leaned towards total independence from Taiwan, won virtually 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of votes has declined by about 8 percent.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the town halls.
In the elections you could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and light girls in dancing clothes.
There was also no lack of the mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary KMT president, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The funny thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to hurt Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not discussed.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China’s military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoids publicizing its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Ma said his policy toward China had been confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Government of Beijing is expected to continue bribing them with trade, in line with its strategy to get Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, he would also like to achieve political integration, but the first thing is first.
It would be best to wait for the 2012 presidential election to pass.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on corruption charges.
President between 2000 and 2008, he openly advocated explicit independence.
However, under Ms. Tsai’s leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PPD presidential candidate, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything it can to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a contact point between the PPD and China, as long as negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “reliable alternative” to Mr. Ma’s precipitous approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said PPD candidates would have been better off unemployed if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intercession, the PPD will find it difficult to choose among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also do a conscientious examination.
Mr. Ma’s valuations have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will restructure its cabinet as well as local teams.
Large samples from the PPD suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, “the point of no return has already been crossed.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the Revelation Artist category.
Act at the request of a president and people will probably look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys’ surprises this year with a top-notch nomination in the Best Revelation Artist category.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, Esperanza, the nomination gives a lot to think about, but it respects the Grammy rules that it must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly represented a breakthrough and, given his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, one can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the path to success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have lately concentrated on the jazz arena.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity,” an exciting and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite strident in New Orleans and a regular guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise leans considerably toward fusion as on the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy punk savage James Argue's Secret Society earned deserved recognition in the big group category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Director of Classic Albums
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his No. 4 symphony, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories spanning orchestra, opera, choral and solo albums.
The Classic Producer of the Year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
Nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals of the Orchestra of various artists.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" from the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Mariinsky National Orchestra and
Grammy-nominated composers for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Passionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for solo instrumental performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for him to play on mandolin Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez was nominated in the orchestral function category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky’s works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets the approval of the ordering commission
The mosque project for Temecula has won unanimous support from the local ordering commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimonies.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, members of the commission decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
“Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews and Baha’is, from all religions,” Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center in the Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
“The truth is, as an American citizen, I’m proud of myself.”
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
“They only speak very loudly.”
“In this valley there are wonderful people.”
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time it was devoted to people interceding for or against the center, about the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“The United States no longer exists,” reads one commentary.
“This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand.”
“America has fallen.”
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Zone Zero, the area where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a property shared with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the bill to the City Council.
A microbe resistant to arsenic raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients broadens the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it demonstrates that it is possible that there are life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
“This body has a double capacity.”
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That makes it a very peculiar thing, although little is missing from it to be a truly ‘alien’ kind of way of life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in Thursday’s online edition of Science.
It has long been considered that there are six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were released, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery “does show is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of “standard” elements we consider indispensable for life may not be as fixed,” said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
The discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one with another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
“However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, to put it mildly, it knocks down the biochemical machinery,” explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they were able to adapt to and use to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form that uses arsenic may naturally exist, whether on other parts of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced with phosphorus isn’t new, but an example has never been found that proves it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early ages of the Earth, he said, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there may be other ways to generate life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton.
The two missing dogs were found in front of the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's officials said Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express pickup they were spending the night in in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met late Wednesday evening, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
“They have returned to their rightful owners.”
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
“An investigation is being conducted.”
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
“We’re following some clues.”
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to make any comments on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's aides found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit at local competitions this week on behalf of the dogs' Japanese owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to be exhibited in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly two-month tour taking part in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their room window.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer breed, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have very thick fur and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, as MGM restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to clear approximately $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and television shows.
The ruling on Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal hurdles for MGM to relaunch under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a small study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In reality, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The study’s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on how to manage their finances, while struggling to make $300 million in interest payments a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron President and bankruptcy recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial tribulations and satisfy the study’s more than 140 creditors, took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion creditors were looking for.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper’s companies will receive multi-million-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive "successful fees" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production on MGM, which released only one film this year, and brought together an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on The Hobbit, along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to fix a studio merger with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep its gift budget balanced
While the iPad is the leading candidate to be this year’s most wonderful toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant downside to your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes of $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
Recently I visited three national toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year’s.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with partner websites, two of the best-known of their kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button battery-powered toys are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are for Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 and more years) are guinea pig-sized plush toys that sing a note when their bellies are tightened.
A squeeze is equivalent to a note, and a second squeeze begins to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start tightening, you can’t stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift-shifting games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar pass, thanks to its innovative wheel-jointed feet with locking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're a kid from the '80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question letters designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correcting exercise notebook occurring.
If you are wary of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60, from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games don’t teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years old), it’s the first major refinement of the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter display.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-style system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a box of matches, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to put words together by putting the blocks in a row before time runs out; it’s formidable for an impromptu word-weaving competition.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, from 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle of its toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of battery-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves quickly over 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to do a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of law enforcement is promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders quietly with military authority.
He wanted chengguan’s female members, China’s burly urban order policemen, feared and despised for their whimsical energetic measures and their propensity for violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firm!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "how pretty the girls are!"
Four girls who barely spent their teens wearing white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and tight trousers to catch the eye.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue and white striped loins.
“Personally, I think they look normal,” Mr. Tang said, scornfully.
“The models are beautiful.”
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grayish-green color of the uniforms to a purportedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: In 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a clumsy cart of snacks, and watched it constantly frowning for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough police a softer, feminine side.
Sadly, even Scarlett Johansson would have to struggle to increase China’s respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat a passerby to death after using their cellphone to film them while dissolving a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published online, describing how to effectively lash out criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street vendor suffered brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar on the government,” lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded “a really meticulous cleanup.”
Skeptics say the current approach is far from that.
After the district solicited eight new female recruits through a notice in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had actual duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure “and the five harmonious facial features.”
They should have been above average height, over 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1 .2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
“Your image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
“First, the candidates’ external qualities will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.”
Then comes the temperament “and the inner qualities.”
Female chengguans are like vases, he said, adding, "besides being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district’s city administration office, isn’t looking forward to backing that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job ads for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not present themselves.
“We can’t allow a person to catch or a hump to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
“Your image wouldn’t be right.”
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his cheeks colored and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His dimpled co-worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said, “Our work must present the image of the city.”
They also don’t object to their fixed-time work, they said, because they harbor bigger career ambitions than just scaring sellers off the alleys where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squad faces a dozen or so street vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many lollipops or tofu bowls as possible before they are thrown away.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
“We’ve told you many times!” said Miss Xu as a salesman walked away, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn cart with noodle garnishes.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is pretty much the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare time.
“Very routine.”
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after a false rumor spread that chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were dumped or set on fire.
At the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two streets away from peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike screamed rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, made their way to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 and older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said quite naturally.
“Most of the time it’s the audience that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
The senator’s attorneys announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have excused Senator John Ensign from criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair took national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said it was "surely pleased" with the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plans to raise charges against him on this issue.”
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, get lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the senator’s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolver door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks to its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to drop prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, amid charges of procedural misconduct.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's top attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor Monday and another call the next day, telling him the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins declined to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we thought they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got work through lobbying thanks to Ensign’s help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign chief of staff John Lopez contacted Hampton and told him he was "crushing" the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the Transportation Secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign is eager to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire’s appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them “chatting” in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the appalling testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut, family, is set to come to an official end, with the imposition of the death penalty judge voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ attorneys have filed papers in court outlining the arguments for appeals that will likely occupy the courts for years to come.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports about the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appeals judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“Based on what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual’s rights to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes’s senior defense attorney.
Trial judge Jon C. Blue of the State Superior Court laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that coverage of celebrity cases can raise questions about the fairness of a lawsuit.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the TV show and the movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media” on high-profile lawsuits, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report saying it was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make the trials fairer.
The issue of Twitter is just one of many topics outlined by Hayes’ attorneys, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge improperly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and had improperly pushed for a verdict for its bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process may attract most interest.
They noted in a rebuttal to the ruling filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually threw firewood at the fire of emotion over the case.
“The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state.”
His focus on Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly, was a playful view that would make the court’s policy on controlling coverage weak in future lawsuits.
But some lawyers said the appeals courts were often drawn to arguments about adaptation that were required in the courts because of social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their letter, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which revoked Dr. Sheppard’s conviction because of the coverage of the process, and made it clear they would demand that the new media would require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century.”
Can civility build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign of invective and negativity, this week has sparked a bit of civics in Washington.
Is it a harbinger of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on the major issues to be addressed during the upcoming session.
But from what everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another empty episode to earn partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That’s just enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a trial period, probing each other for signs of cooperativism and commitment, as they try to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That’s why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent assessments of it by participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep-rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care, or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
However, the November election has softened mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There's no doubt that things have changed with respect to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse party passions, which then become extinct.
That's good."
In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to widen unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans can’t make it sound like they’re in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying the unemployment subsidy for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112nd Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely, even inevitable, that a period of disagreement will begin.
"After the things that have to be done are done, in the short term psychology will turn the situation back into a confrontational one," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civility can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The motives have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they should try to keep their promises to cut state spending and overturn the new health care law.
Those supportive lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit commission’s recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly put the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officials elected on the panel, suggesting that there is, at least at present, little basis or desire for engagement in fiscal matters.
Galston predicts two phases in battles between White House and Congressional Republicans.
The first will take place next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch closely the reaction of the people.
Whoever they think is losing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partyism and polarization are now larger than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a “kleptocracy,” and it leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money it raises directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service have been reported to operate massive blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical authority,” takes its part as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he claimed: “It’s crazy, it’s a hoax, it’s a nuisance.”
According to the polls, the Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it’s unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it’s unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do that.
"The Moscow city government's direct links to crime have led some to call it 'dysfunctional', and to claim that the government functions more as a kleptocracy than as a government," the statement said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term from the criminal world and the mafia that literally means ‘ceiling’ or protection) that runs through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
“Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow’s criminal world.”
“Luzhkov is at the top.”
“The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level.”
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city doesn’t provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS collects money from the largest companies, and that the police are targeting small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the money collection is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports about men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
“In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats,” Georgy Satarov, director of Indem’s Moscow expert group, said in a recent interview.
“But he’s a part of this bureaucracy.”
“He doesn’t belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked at least to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not happen late at night Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed on CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that claimed U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we don’t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a faintly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Khmer Rouge.
“Everyone loves Ta Mok.”
“He was a good leader and he cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as “the Butcher” for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook here that for the first time teaches the story of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations and Cambodia court issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of those events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can’t do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
“For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“This is creating divisions within families.”
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died from hunger, disease or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian-Thai border.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest fighters of the Khmer Rouge fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the Shallow Soldiers remain poor, unskilled farmers.
“These people have gained little benefit after the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the regime’s utopian agrarian ideology.”
“They were raised without any concept for doing business.”
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before turning to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
“But now life is hard because we have to supply ourselves.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute the top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told investigators at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are believed to have died.
On a recent bustling afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden piles on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She said that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” he said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But confronting the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
“Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is reuniting the broken pieces,” he said.
“It’s our obligation to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called “A History of Democratic Kampuchea,” of 75 pages.
It was distributed on Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they’re not sure how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
However, here the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot’s body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the side of the road, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
“But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him,” he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot’s last rest, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hopes of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its reserve of qualified uranium for armaments
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will renounce its supply of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations with Belarus had been carried out in the past two months to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-qualified uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday’s deal to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kilograms, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity because of the confidentiality of the matter.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was apparently a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This shows that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton called the deal "a very significant and important step" by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have conserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-grade uranium) and low-enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated as the material had been lightly irradiated.
Officials said he was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the low-enriched uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on the Global Threat Reduction, said that “this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen confidence” that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential easing.
“While progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens.”
The Spanish government has not repaired the flights of the CIA
The Spanish government did not make any repairs to the flights of the CIA with Taliban prisoners and al Qaeda headed for Guantanamo Bay through Spanish territory, the US ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, which adds that the then first vice president of the government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were exercising appropriate surveillance on foreign planes that cross Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights practices, there was a meeting between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report had "taken Zapatero's government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no concerns about intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "snatched off," Aguirre says on a cable.
The then foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited capacity for influence."
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez told the embassy that he would not try to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Defense Ministry on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concern over “apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors,” rather than declassified information from the CNI or the Defense Ministry.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between U.S. Ambassador Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba and Interior Minister Alfredo Rubalcaba, he told him that "although Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The ambassador also expresses concern about the PP’s actions in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that Zapatero’s government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, even if these disclosures have negative consequences for the U.S. government.”
Confessed Parricide Complained in the Network of the "Agobic" of Being a Mother
The young woman talked about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror a la gallega"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she used from a young age, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the Coruñese village from which she comes.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, you need to know their love life, which ABC reconstructs through the testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician, 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tuñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get the DNA test.
It wasn’t long before I met another boyfriend.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He lived with her for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even came to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance fractured, which they broke.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and musketeered, because I have come to work."
“When I said it to him it seemed good, but of course, he now realizes what it’s like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
Then, talk about a message to the phone you just received: "I want you to turn around this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains: “If he doesn’t like me to leave the kid with my mother, I’ll pick him up when he comes back,” she says.
In May, he talks about returning to his village: “This week I’m going to go there, but I’ll only be until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to run for a job so I don’t lose it.”
If all goes well, he takes his firstborn.

People would win four seats in Congress and the PSC would lose nine.
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and experienced deputies in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has its eyes on the general elections because, whether advance or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation gets in these elections usually doubles the one it receives in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 regional elections, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, continues, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose one deputy - now has three - while ICV would stay with one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay to the head of the Diputación de Barcelona, one of the most budgeted administrations - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and people agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it needs to get 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can take the lead in the turn in the Tarragona capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has been placed only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Popular have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three detainees in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the last perpetrator of the bombings in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of assuring that with “Operation Kampai” Al Qaeda’s counterfeiting apparatus has been “weakened” internationally and, “therefore, its operational capacity”.
Investigators estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that make up the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their “combatants” can cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The decommissioned cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, which is why, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units have participated in the investigations, so it is not ruled out that similar blows are carried out in EU territory in the coming days as developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was developed in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistani Bukharan and the Thai Bukharan.
These were the ones who ran from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it hit in 2009 - was mainly stealing tourists passports that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents must be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators say no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the attacker, “Laskar and Taiba,” was one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was carried out, some 1,000 dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
Police have seized extensive documentation.
The PP asks Mas to park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already proposed during the campaign and that are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and do not take pro-sovereignist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to propose.
The president of the popular Catalans came to the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that he has obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to make himself wanted, because the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the investiture vote.
On a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has with the rest of the political leaders are done in Catalan.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investiture “we will have to stop all sovereignist and independence speeches”, as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to put to a referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated regional administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Catalan Solidarity).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center do not rule out that their caretaker killed more than 11 elderly people
The heads of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there employed killed at least eleven elders in his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the person responsible" of the deaths but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil culprits".
In addition to the social contempt that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the jailer in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation already calculated by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed to the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was carried out by phone.
The charity, through its director, flatly denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot have been at any time the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “there is not a single indication in the case that there has been any reckless action by anyone other than the defendant himself.”
The former “Angel of Death” confessed yesterday to 11 murders and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009, to kill a second grandmother a month and a half later.
In this case, he caused death by pinching an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed using a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to medicines.
The insulin punctures and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the tests that are being done in the laboratory that will clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed to the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the jailer, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the courthouse and in the little sense that he has to change his way after having successfully committed eight murders.
That’s why they say they put themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet’s threat that “markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
Peripheral spreads have been tightly closed and European banks’ shares have risen more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes either, and the euro has barely picked up, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses recovers but motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose his fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded to finalize the plan to buy public debt for ineffective and eliminate all extraordinary measures of liquidity on time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures “at least until March” and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue with their bond-buying program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, may God assist us!
As in their May meeting where they said they hadn’t even contemplated buying bonds and collapsed markets, history could repeat tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazuca on Monday and on Wednesday said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued $500 million at 5.28%, compared to $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to raise private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to spot the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumeable within the Relief Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax tension ahead of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14 in which a political commitment is needed that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch Wagner and the rest the Beethoven anthem of joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity by presenting yesterday the plan of measures to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish stock market has risen by 4.5%, double that of the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for a relief plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don’t need, the Treasury has more than $40 billion in liquidity available three times as much as in March, at very high rates and closes you to the sine dice markets.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "besides being so, look so."
Courage, we can.
Eulen president to challenge Vega Sicilia board requested by his children
The storm does not amaze in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, as he considers it "null in full right", the judicial board of El Enebro next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are refining the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company does not seem willing to give in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was disgruntled by five of his seven sons who were appointed directors at the shareholders’ meeting on January 18 of this year and whose challenge is noted in the Commercial Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunder within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants his five children to, through procedural wit, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null junta of January 18," according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the impeachment of the board once it has been held, considering it to be "null and void".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried to have the magistrate convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group, however, claims usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantive issue that must be decided by the judge once the hearing on the challenge is held, for which there is not yet a specified date.
Red Bull wins in F1 with secret Siemens weapon
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship everyone bet on the victory of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without denying the driver’s ability, Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine powering his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the “secret weapon” that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from the high motor racing.
Called PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly lines of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan’s most celebrated utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out “in a few hours, almost in real time”, the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the balls.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull bolides except for the engine, which is the entire responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from virtual reality from the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological refinement is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend maximum in each season to facilitate the competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolides in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The squad for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull’s Formula One, without a doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and its notoriety null.
Steve Nevey, head of technology at the factory, said five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in truck cars contributed 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computers because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to Install 20 Own Stores with Local Distributors in Two Years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) today inaugurated in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will reconcile this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, used as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP Personal Systems said that the philosophy for installing the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishment personnel.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, care, after-sales and even packaging."
The store in Barcelona includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP’s computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days.”
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said.
Sabadell bets to ‘steal’ one million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially rules out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be partly offset by commission increases and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to capture in three years one million private customers, his subject pending.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will run for three years.
The goal, in addition to surviving without having to resort to public aid from FROB, is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted - its great outstanding subject, since until now it had pampered SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with reduced costs as a goal, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the year.
Few banks today dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has upset all the plans of global banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close its four-year-old Optima master plan this year, although initially it was for three, but the market situation made it one more exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes slip will be their main goal.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a “difficult and momentous” year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the war on liabilities – which penalises margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and coffers are paying for their liquidity is already shifting to the price of credit to offset the fall in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it’s going to be a pressure factor on credit.”
“We haven’t closed the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave Thursday orders to his network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads -see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now “is to raise commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "larger sizes will be required."
"Next year everything will move," he said.
He claims that capital needs are “very high” and does not rule out that any Spanish financial institution enters into red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market in fundraising in the face of new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary market shutdown, it downplayed what some bankers are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which cushions the crisis.
The ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out a wave of savings bank mergers and reiterated the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentrating the Spanish savings banks started, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations is going to occur.
“I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group can’t be said to be a second round, so there are adjustments.”
“Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and supervised by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot too,” he said.
Speaking during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the concentration process is taking place "at the fastest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the deadlines that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphasized.
“Going from 45 crates with an average asset volume of 28.5 billion to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that is unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector came off very well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It goes without saying that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of many of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible solutions to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the currency zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to transgressor countries, possible suspensions of payments from some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government took a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigor and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second in the forehead was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully lengthened the decision to save Greece.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel emerges again with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run at part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the process of reform of the Union that makes those measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which he may not agree, from that date onwards the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which infringing countries will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare themselves suspended from payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a strict growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we would do wrong not to understand it.
It’s not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater tranquility.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity that they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with the big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that order must be put in the house has made its way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn’t look like it’s going to move.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, the abandonment of a currency zone too crowded with countries that are not serious, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and Law Fraud
Bullshit like that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but do not want to escape a sanction.
The alleged expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match against Ajax on 23 November in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether or not such behavior is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when it came to making mistakes to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and will be able to pass clear of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee has sanctioned the team’s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and with different financial amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the football world.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the case is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and which has sometimes fined its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of historionic and provocative coach.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether with these actions fraud of the law is committed; because, in fact, they are actions respecting the sporting regulation, but seem to evade its meaning.
The issue is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that comprises the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with fair play is to prevent the team of offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradoxical thing about the action of Real Madrid players is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as cheating or law fraud, since its violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely its action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage offenders gain in the intentional flaws examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the rival is not put in a disadvantageous situation nor is a profit obtained in the same game, since evidently the result of the action involves leaving the team itself with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, since the team can be eliminated at the first of the change, and also with this action the players complete a penalty match and move on to the second card cycle, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, from passing rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions are not against the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor to get the most out of what the rules allow.
In the case before us, the players did not act to evade the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without escaping the punishment or escaping it.
Although the boundary between ingenuity and law fraud is fuzzy, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the guideline was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offers offensive to capture Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reserves for the 16th and 17th.
Self-sufficiency celebrations are proliferating for employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the calf and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the pre-Christmas group dinners, which continue to exercise as an oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide the associations of the sector.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year’s calendar (after New Year’s Eve on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (16 and 17) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lean cow stage began, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
Not to mention tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the circumstances, some demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Restoration Guild of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to predict how the festivities this month will be.
"People think about it long before they book."
“He wants to go out but he has the alerts on the price issue,” he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go one step down with the crisis, so the band around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey in several central establishments shows the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has brought more advance booking, even since the beginning of November.
“We have done the impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros.”
In AN Grup, which promotes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 stores, remain optimistic after detecting a revenue boom from the second half and good, but concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Group sources point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who precede the holidays.
To its six group menus have added a Christmas menu, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that re-invite their employees and a sense that the volume of groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Association of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to start seeing the end of the tunnel and argues that overall the reservations are "lively", although customers "negotiate to the maximum".
Of course, the illusion for the festivities has not come down, pays whoever pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises major concerns in the US
Islamabad is producing atomic weapons “at a faster rate than any other country.”
Wikileaks leaks confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the WikiLeaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program provokes in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on atomic security, instead of going up, “decreases,” and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for unveiling in Washington.
Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson lists this in a report prior to the visit of then National Security Adviser James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep watch.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The latest in the documentation leaked by Julian Assange’s portal is the diminishing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan’s high rate of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, calling communication with Pakistan “frustrating,” said: “Transparency is often non-existent; offers of help go unanswered or are dismissed.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also calls on Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistani Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
The Hunt for the WikiLeaks Chief
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorist official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange where he is.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It’s not new, it’s from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks creator Mark Stephens’ lawyer said: “Police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
It was on the 20th that the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
All 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange “in view of his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, the organization has explained, do consider the so-called free-kick network to carry out an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police body - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move has outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the founder of WikiLeaks, 39, has been willing to respond by videoconference to questions from Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
“This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him – and from Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange remains in unknown whereabouts, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the U.N. in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign,” he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counter-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with views he has proclaimed as conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the House Homeland Security Committee from January, has called on the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and prosecute anyone who contributes or helps them."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying Assange should be “killed.”
"Obama should make it a target and use a drone or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment,” he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with similar nods to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to avoid the nth internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC, without north for the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party president is aware that his resignation cover is insufficient for the likes of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can not cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will try to win the new critics with winks that allow him to arm himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to comment on its continuity in secret.
By ballot, not by hand.
If the Caradists want to cast a certain punishment vote on the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be good for a result "a Bulgarian".
Those close to Carod demand more from the president than putting his office at the disposal of the militia, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ among congresses.
But as they do not have enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a roadmap by May.
To do this, they hope to participate in the elaboration of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for him promising to advance the congress in the fall of 2011, something that the summit already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that “polyphony” is damaging stability and that his goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty rags indoors.
In this line, the article that the acting councillor Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the head of Innovation took for granted that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new faces coming from the Carod-related sector.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC at once assembleism as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
To end the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive 2008 conclave left the management with the task of reviewing assemblyism at a specific statute reform congress.
This appointment remains pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged addressing the issue.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to pick it up again and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO State of Mexico count, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO Estado de México.

Next to him the agents found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China continues to offer to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and re-convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made clear that China will not modify its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this matter.
He said China’s climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programs.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set for the reduction of gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated way with state and local authorities, to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, several multi-year plans are underway or have already been completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficient Use Program, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent foci by savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific advisor on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he said, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years and expects to do just as much by 2020.
Attached to the legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former Panista leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former Panista leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what suits his right.
In an interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has his right to appeal, if necessary, to the Commission of Order of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will emerge strengthened from the internal election on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
“That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal,” he said.
The Panista leader said that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he said.
He said the council will no doubt know how to choose the best leader or the best leader that National Action requires for the next three years, hence he will hand over the scaffold “to whomever the council determines.”
"I have that absolute peace of mind and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the pickup in the last election on July 4 will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although “it is not yet time to think about 2012.”
"For now it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are placed on them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations."
When asked about the PRI’s criticisms of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of the four years of his government, César Nava called on the priists to reflect on the six-year-olds of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon, let them start defending them, let them get out of the closet,” he said.
He opined that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no gag in the country, much less censorship.
Obama Promotes Twitter Law for Undocumented Students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” the president tweeted.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps a cyber link open to a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with senators, given that the legislation’s vote is imminent.
“With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the bills.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
“I think we can make a deal at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a "closed vote" on the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, though it's more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years and have entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the initiative, requiring the contest of a handful of Republicans, at a time when supporters of the bill are lobbying intensely to ensure passage of the law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican has expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That’s why supporters of the Dream Act require adding several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martinez’s term.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Utah’s Orrin Hatch and Texas’ Kay Bailey Hutchinson, but have said they won’t back it another time.
Another Republican who supported it, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of the Tongue was a walk where the participants showed the storytelling
"That of sex in the language I understand it but ... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to sex).
The finger in the sore... "it puts us in trouble," the Argentine writer, mostly young people, sweetly told the public, who gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what is the "lash", goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not get answers although clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist comes convinced: "patience is not my strong, perhaps it is my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "I only knew from the sore that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue should be very much intersected.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative that he titled Praise of Invention, where the finger in the sore is not named but at one point is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, the tale of a famous sorceress, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to speak later America, the great novel that was not lacking from the beginning his own chroniclers who told it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the tale.
Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that was lacking even in modesty.
However, he highlighted "it's the fools and the cheats who best imagine" and it is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that of the narrated belongs to one side or the other, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
In fact, he calls it the "Cervantine tradition."
“By his inheritance we are what is counted.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montero embraced and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the FIL’s invitation with her round table The finger in the sore.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican aimed his towards the great scourge of social violence that crosses his country - and shares Latin America - product of the disputes of trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes."
“To be masters of our thinking and to be masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance means many times to put the finger on the sore and to annoy those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also to annoy those powers that prefer a black and white world,” he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up consoling himself with the medal of the runner-up, he has been one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The saintly strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he took the reins of Morelia with which he fell by 4-2 overall against Toluca; later, in Clausura 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with 3-1 overall and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Devils, Rubén suffered a setback, as his team ended up tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty round he put himself in a 3-1 lead with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4th lap.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same luck, seeks to get rid of the spell and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistic, this is for a club, for a hobby that I owe and as a result the title will come to me, but the above is the most important thing," the driver said when asked about the numbers he has against playing finals.
“The only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles at the end we can’t celebrate, we’re ready in the line, the players also, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were already ready to run and I think that’s a lesson, until the game is over we can celebrate.”
Knowing that this series could be defined in penal shots, something that does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the set of penalties, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad move that fate, sometimes because of the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but we were not waiting for this final.
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up coach and test the glory of the titles for the first time.
U.S. Changes Rules for Getting a Visa
Individuals will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
Starting January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASCs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for petition visa cases (including temporary worker visas), and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
Those who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their footprints.
Because the biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will stay there for less time than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

NASA to find extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency has quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will make an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will unveil an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as tasked with studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present "a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life," prompting speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that creatures exist alongside us and in hostile environments thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of them becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this ability increases the possibility that similar life might exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that “there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from the one we know.”
The space agency will unveil the true scope of the findings at tomorrow’s press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it leads to the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanship' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'throned' against the reform to the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, begins “bipartisanship”, because now it will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be swept up again by both parties and with it the opposition coalition is over.
“So far [the opposition coalition] has arrived, that’s what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he went on, that Congress after it has been monopolistic, now it is “duopoly.”
“It’s not the spirit of law reform that there’s an eternal bipatidism in Congress.”
For starters, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other comrades to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress became a ‘booty’ between two, alluding to the PAN and PRI.
“It was just a game before, now they’re splitting it between two.”
Patrón Montalvo, asked that the deputy’s personality be respected, that he be given his place at the negotiating tables.
"That not by cupular agreements, let out 5 that we are probably going to do 9 deputies, now to the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made that they agreed to, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for "supplier"
Mazatlán City Council pays another check to the questioned owner of electrical equipment company.
One more check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200,000 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Higher Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed and, therefore, how many more checks are missing to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“You haven’t bought anything, you’re just being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two from October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter from November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, as the Law marks when a company is challenged by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer said that they have not used their services again.
After the 25th of July, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to meet tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and places that are in bad condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that they take care of the image of the destination and reverse the bad that tourists encounter with new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and benches has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and take it back to nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a company one day and they have no idea what money is lost, or else they wouldn’t do the works in this way in so long a time and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because giving preventive maintenance and not fall only in the corrective," he said.
“We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well.”
There are other places that also look careless and incomplete, he said, like Mazatlan’s Shield and Venadit.
“Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has clean on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions,” he said.
“Due attention has not been given and this type of fact highlights something that is notorious by everyone, maintenance is needed.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not exploited correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up to date, clean, tidy and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Requests IP results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that MEPs take on the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A legislature of dignified work and free from agreements between parties and the state Executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday the 60th legislature was installed, made up of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which totals 40 popular representatives.
Among the expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
“We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to watch over their own interests and become carnival comrades of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions.”
That is why he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to bring forward the Governor in turn.
"We want them to come and do a decent job and above all committed to society and to the sectors because it was the Signanoenses who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage the generation of jobs.”
Regarding tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight he has within the state budget to strengthen the state Tourism Secretary.
“I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that directly competes with the agro-industry.”
In addition, it is required to label resources for detonating tourism projects that help to give security to the state and to update the Alcohol Law that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
We are looking for a magician king.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next King’s Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a donkey.
However, Adelaide, Isabella, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and live on a daily basis because the father does not have a fixed job.
“Well, sometimes we feel tough because my husband doesn’t have chamba, but we sell mandarin and potato... already in the afternoon I go out with the ‘plebes’ to sell on the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10, has long aspired to have a "monster" car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothing size for one year.
"He said to me (Jose Alfredo), 'I would like this monster,' but I said 'let's go see son,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, those in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Michael, 8, uses size eight.
Jose Juan, 14, is missing tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be of great help.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the Search for a Wizarding King campaign by donating a toy or cash at the Northwest Reception.
Fourteen suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various accusations.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
“Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and production equipment have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear in Sherbrooke’s courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have come after a lengthy investigation that has lasted nearly a year.
“It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests,” Mr. Ruel said.
About 70 officers from the Quebec Security Estrie investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
You will be able to fight illegal migration without problems
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should solve the problem of illegal migrants’ paternalities, is likely to face major opposition, as all three opposition parties announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
“I find myself here with a party that has created the granite you are stepping on,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone coming from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not back the bill because it targets the wrong target.
“We’re against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we’ll see what the government does,” Duceppe said.
NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow has rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
“Neo-Democrats agree that action should be taken against the clandestine paternal caregivers and that is what we are aiming for with another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservatives’ bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a fluff.”
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” said Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote to be held so that each deputy who is going to oppose is explained later before his voters.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and anti-collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation in New York since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday’s announcement caught more than one by surprise.
It can be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services held on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party’s public safety critic Stéphane Bergeron to call the announcement “a rabbit pulled out of the chister” and “a last-minute mockery solution.”
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” he simply says.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest is obsessed with avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggests Quebec grant a special mandate to the attorney general to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervenor,” he concludes.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the intervenor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only pending project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also calls on Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to have come from the Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to the biker groups, although the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa pushed for the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, in Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, they have been evacuated from their homes.
At night, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rainfall.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations add to the thawing of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday evening, Quebec’s Civilian Security Unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to clear out in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventative measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has resulted in the closure of several lanes, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civilian Security Unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, security adviser Annik Bouchard said.
The Quebec Rise Prediction Center, for its part, issued announcements Wednesday communicating the strong rises of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partially to blame Dupont
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback to the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CCNR) over controversial statements regarding welfare and Haitians, as well as his rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained “inaccurate information about social assistance, unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day.”
The Council has also indicated that debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of People Receiving Social Assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were not correct.
Presenters should report reliable and not misleading data.
In connection with suicide, the presenter Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most Committee members have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be viewed as a solution to life’s problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, in this regard, any guilt has been discarded.
The latest litigation referred to the statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had staged a media confrontation that had sparked numerous reactions.
The host of CHOI stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if those in need would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
“I’ve already served my three-day suspension up there.”
“My file has been clean for a year and a half,” the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of coarse language.
In any case, radio station CHOI-FM has collaborated “even more than required.”
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, who must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of highest audience within three days.
A Kung Fu King in Montreal
The Algerian-born watchmaker Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, climbs the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
“In my case, I look for fights everywhere because, for those who don’t enjoy the on-the-ground game involved in mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of UPS, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals in the amateur World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Championship, held from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won in the categories of Kickboxing Full Contact and Thai Boxing,” he explained.
“I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China.
“They will invite the athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category.”
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
“In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place.”
“In 2007, in China, I finished fifth, but I reached third in Toronto in 2009,” he added.
"What's interesting is that I've been making progress in every competition."
“At this point, I’ll be the first one this time or next year!”
San shou or sanda is a discipline native to China in which one is allowed to hit with the fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
Matches are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal must only maintain one competition in his career, he will certainly attend the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
“This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China,” explains the nice guy.
“It’s like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).
“It’s been an incredible experience.”
Zemmal won his first match, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“The one who won me is a real professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semifinal winners face off in the final of their category."
“The champions of each category then face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu.”
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than a hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without prior tender the most important contract, that of project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortiums poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and lead to a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition.”
"I mean, people, instead of doing it in secret, now they do it openly," Quebec MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there was a collusion with this contract.
“I’m starting to get tired,” he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted “dishonestly” and “with a lack of rigor.”
He pointed out that “the least” would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of the consortiums is a common practice in the whole world.
Normally, this is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
Work has already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract was awarded without competition coming into play; it was a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of the consortiums in the field of technical advice is undergoing an investigation in the Government.
A quick look at the Quebec Merchant Registry allows us to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, that is, Dessau.
Regarding the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular workforce dynamic and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
“If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher.”
“You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and tell them: we’re going to negotiate a satisfactory deal and at a good price.”
“However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people,” Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has hinted that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are “good acquaintances of the Quebec Liberal Party.”
Minister Normandeau has let down that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which “finance” it, before specifying that it is rather about its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More environmentally friendly, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade brands or ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse: the consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages are teeming with more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and believes that it even slows down their commitment.
Even though consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: Half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates that carry so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are “ecorresponsible,” the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take the speeches of politicians on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of the information cause 46% of consumers to discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of the supposed yields of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, nearly half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in shops in their neighborhood and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, the Barometer notes.
Greener and more responsible (the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 points out of a peak of 100 this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to take the place of the king of recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be outside doors: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this large behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Quebec government, which has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex pos the Société Angus and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Paralèle, who were expecting a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard again and give him back his true cinematic vocation, have not gotten what they were asking for.
The government has agreed to get involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, be lower than the initial expectations; it could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then applications have been revised downward.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, submitted a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a state donation must be completely discarded.
The Quebec Film Hall and Complex Owners Association opposed a direct state investment to support eXcentris’ recovery, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not fund real estate projects, since it has not done so with other movie theaters.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector are demanding considerable financial assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has carried for ten years the burden of author cinema in its premises, after financing its own construction, which could justify a waiver by the Treasury Council.
The lack of independent movie theaters is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to retain its customers.
The company Angus and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are launching a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $ 700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these venues, the Parallel, continues to screen films on eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three halls on February 27, screening Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downside proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted.
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks unveil what the U.S. considers to be the Canadians’ complex over the Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter’s sense of superiority toward Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable from September 22, 2008, i.e., during the federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not get into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex virtually inherent in Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Accordingly, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this choice: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this “deafening silence” because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“Logically, he thinks, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more so of the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting.”
This sentiment of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the government’s survival during the February vote on the federal budget, through which Canada will first register deficits in the past decade due to a $30,000-$40 billion recovery plan,” Mr. Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend the parliament before Christmas to prevent its replacement by the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington of the increasingly negative image conveyed by the dramatic series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the kidnappings for the CIA to carry out energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but that it depended “on each case.”
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods have warmed in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “murdered.”
In the United States they echo Mike Huckabee.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount that corresponds to practically a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate before 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, even better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should be further decreased to stabilize, by 2020, the rise in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from spiraling out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is reduced even twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above, they contain no mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about compact fluorescent bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not compact fluorescent bulbs, but coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for “immediate” publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d’Ivoire, given that the deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,” a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“Ask all parties in Côte d’Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed Wednesday’s midnight deadline to pass without the results being published, three days after Sunday’s ballot.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the president of the CIS had told television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied around the world.
However, the Gbagbo side counts on the constitutional council annulling the “fraudulent” votes in the north, in the hands of the former New Forces (FN) rebellion since the failed September 2002 coup.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Côte d'Ivoire, said the intimidation maneuvers carried out by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the followers of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo’s opponents consider that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has deemed the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have set the stage for the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the political class in Côte d’Ivoire that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the continental territory (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the seasonally adjusted data published Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Second-quarter data have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population in the continental territory and 9.7% with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available within two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of young people present in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points both in three months and in one year), that is, 482,000 people over 50, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with the DOMs.
Unemployment has only been stable among people aged 25-49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy about its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social goods, embezzlement of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
“Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts.”
“It’s easy to chase him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it’s another thing to prove them,” her lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP ahead of her client’s appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night, they began investigating and jailed one of their close associates, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done has been to take care of the landfills he has to manage.
As for the allocation of the contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to the lawyer Simon.
Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for embezzlement of funds and complicity, has also been investigated since Wednesday, but he has been released on probation and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
“My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been blamed on him.”
"The investigating magistrate has taken the explanations into account and released him," his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, said.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday they questioned four other people and released them, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of “trafficking influences and passive corruption”.
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated for "theft and embezzlement of public goods by a person dedicated to the public service" and for "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds", respectively.
Lastly, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “cover-up of the abuse of social goods.”
Among the people who have confronted Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect that their societies have served to launder the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several court orders initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations focus especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Case of Clotilde Reiss: the Elisha has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for “espionage”, has been haunting the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elisha has explained his strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice on managing their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman did not come in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by U.S. justice for trafficking materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
He didn't actually do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris bears the headline "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage-taking cases".
The Eliseo’s adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held forcibly in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continuously release” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate release.”
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do so more often.”
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discreet channels are exhausted, “silence will not solve anything”, Iranians are “experts in delaying maneuvers”.
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is “a usual Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money" (230,000 euros reward).
Moreover, he notes that the Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that “is going to increase.”
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he says.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
The Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iran’s clandestine procurement networks for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Freeing the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guarantees that it was not so.
The Elisha, he says, not only "has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot annul the judicial decision", he says.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the “narrow” surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elisha adviser dials a phone number, hangs it, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in some buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee does not spare in efforts, it uses communiqués and “leaks” organized in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an “important” and “influenced” role as a “mediator”.
Americans watch this activity with some irony and check that the manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles broadcast the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions the "media blitz" of French officials.
What is the reason for such “gratitude” towards Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
Next, the document deals with the reasons that led Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort “is intended to validate Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he says.
A policy started in 2008, which “in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been branded premature and undeserved.”
In “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris tries to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confides to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
“But anyway, we’ve thanked him.”
“At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Eliseo.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
After midnight, young Koreans can’t play online
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under 16 years old, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day.”
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” said AFP Minister Jo Rin, who is in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, precise.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit daily access time to these games when the parents of the young people so request, the official added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow you to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the organizing countries
Amid the storm of corruption suspicions, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday appointed the 2018 and 2022 World Cup host countries, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can come to take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests that are at stake at a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to FIFA’s evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when it comes to voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of their country, birthplace of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood on Monday by releasing a documentary that has highlighted three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to dislike FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the coup successfully given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had managed in 2005 for London the organization of the J.O.O. 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to regain England’s brilliance at the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World Cup of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they get is to give points to Russia, which has become a heavy outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stages, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced “unfair competition in voting preparation,” in a direct allusion to accusations by the English press against members of the EC.
“They’re bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, looks like the most logical favorites.
The world’s largest economic powerhouse and home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country appears to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new bids seem premature for two countries that organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Alongside Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had hinted that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubts.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence does not match well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that he doubts.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they didn’t believe it, Jacques Chirac’s friends said he didn’t rule out a third term.
On November 15, in earnest, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the MPs of the UMP, on Tuesday night in the Eliseo, the possibility of "two terms" has caused some stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It simply conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
It’s not the first time he’s talked about the presidential election in such a playful tone.
“At worst, or better, you’ll still be spending seven and a half years with me,” he said in July 2009.
Another time, in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about what's coming next."
His statements from before yesterday do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
Comments are raised for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has come to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Rather the opposite; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what prompts many PS people to demand that the battle be organized ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," the Prime Minister's environment has reacted immediately and prudently.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“He will always think he can win,” Alain Juppé says, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow to specify the modalities of exit from the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that are expected to end by the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuance institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the ECB’s active role in solving the debt crisis of European states.
He did not want to say if he thought the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its program of buying state bonds.
“I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans.”
Last night in Brussels, during his hearing before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet was no more eloquent about his intentions, merely indicating that the program of buying state letters in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" during Thursday's meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB is going to keep its main invariable rate at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly €1.3 billion.
In addition, according to indiscreet market participants, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese securities again.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired securities worth €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market participants, there is little doubt that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in course.
Although lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity on beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I don't think it's going to significantly modify your program."
“If not, it would run the risk of triggering new short-term tensions,” said Commerzbank economist Michael Schubert.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal, said in a statement.
Oppenheim.
Regarding interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these bonds in order for the market to remain stable,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuer has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked increase in the returns paid by the most fragile states," a senior bond manager said.
Because, if interest rates get caught up in the clouds, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government caps the storm
After Italy began the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of bond rates to 10 years.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the exit of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have said that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy hedge contracts (CRQs) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing some stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" about "turbulence in the markets" and possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of revenues associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
Brussels’ latest forecasts have been a jar of cold water for the government.
Italian growth is estimated to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures should be adopted," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
“The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts are in good shape, as we have been saying for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are smaller than those required from other countries,” said OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period that is not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis would open up.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to fight the crisis
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris: “I think we have already shown on Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly solidary, determined, committed to the defense of their currency and their monetary zone.”
Although relative, yesterday’s easing in European bond rates has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of standardization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor’s announced that it could lower Portugal’s debt rating, the most frequent target for speculation today.
“As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs heavily on banking systems,” say Exane economists BNP Paribas.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets.”
Aware of this gap and the dangers it hides, European countries are stepping up their debates to strengthen the existing mechanisms to get out of the crisis.
Informal consultations between finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda is the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in collimating markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has started a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors from the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the goal of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly sets the stage.
The first issues of EFSF securities are expected to be made next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilised through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path from the one followed by Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid seeking international aid at all costs before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms that they consider essential to build confidence in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are considering the options available to speed up the process of normalization of the public bond markets.
Passing through Paris on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that if the €75 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to pull out of the portfolio again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a front-line player in the European public debt market, consider that an amount of around 100 billion euros extra would suffice, “preferably” in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently endowed with EUR 60 billion.
This is a piece of advice that, without a doubt, could be examined in detail in the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are currently on orange alert because of the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen since Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects northern Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the Isle of France.
Snow layers between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Île-de-France and Lemosin.
The snowfall is strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, Météo France warns.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited to heavy vehicles over 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles.
According to the gendarmes, traffic in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend not to drive except in case of need and the circulation of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
On Thursday, school transportation was banned in Picardy.
No specific measures had been planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport in South London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the Island of France has reached its peak, billions have rained.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the metro of the Grand Paris that the Société du Grand Paris must build.
To initiate this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4 billion euros.
On the theoretical level, this sum will later allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, we finally have the first accounts.
The 2010 Corrigendum Finance Act, reviewed in the National Assembly’s Finance Committee this morning, contains the devices expected to find the first part of that money.
There are two modes: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the tax on offices on the Island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate that increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it is far from 4 billion.
“It is necessary that the fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that will be mobilized by the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,” we read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
“From the moment income is created, we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as we explain.”
"It will be recorded in the budget and will be used according to needs."
The SGP estimates that it will start receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised $4 billion is not included in the credit, can provoke a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Avengers hackers and diligent spies
Wikileaks is of double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes on an international scale and envisions a future dominated by regression.
But let’s go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of which nation it belongs to) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi’s sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of publicly known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Gral, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in previous works.
This is not just because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who engage in occultism do not just rely on what they already know, which reconfirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, editor of the Libération), who only considers what he can recognize to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that sent the U.S. embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as the one published in the Newsweek the week before.
So why have the revelations in these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultured person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since the heads of state can call on the phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have become centers of espionage.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows this perfectly, we only seem to know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that an ordinary hacker can look up the secrets of the most powerful country in the world greatly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "judges".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, he could conceive himself to all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every move thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power can escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer keep its own secrets stand?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power from her.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and a lot to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any confidential information on the network, since it would be like publishing it on a poster in the street.
But it’s also clear that with current technologies, you can’t expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state has traveled by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is a science fiction thing and, therefore, novelistic, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at most, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a telegraph with cables (telephones).
The (analog) videotapes had allowed the film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, uncovering all the secrets of the montage, while now the (digital) CDs only allow you to move forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the displacements that entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary for politics and communication techniques to take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly going on in the embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s shambles in its funding pledges
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked funding promises (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been fulfilled.
And the french fries have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged to contribute €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its member states, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation proved appreciable and was appreciated for what it was really worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Accord, the money must be “new and additional” to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what “new and additional” means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added over three years in terms of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with respect to the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to expenditure in previous years or the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France’s aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while pretending to respect its commitment to “new and additional” funds.
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider each euro borrowed to be equivalent to one euro donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is false to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated ... At most, only the cost of the loan for the country that grants the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it “respects” its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros); refer to the EU document to see it for your own eyes.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to fulfill its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France performs a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending just 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million “new and additional”, as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other Member States going to continue to donate when they could just lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a meticulous, relatively short-term, in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could move forward the debates on gambling in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter that is currently being debated): we will not get rid of the question of "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move the negotiations forward.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Générations Futures association (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have significant statistical value considering the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem addressed", acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that usually consume a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These meals taken as a model, which comply with official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three parts of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
“Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is worrisome.”
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can damage the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a school snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in the food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were dressed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the slice of salmon was the most “nutritive” with 34 chemical residues detected and even analysis of the plastic dish used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk these “pollutant cocktails” generate for the consumer is “probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Alliance Europa Ecología-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
