Austria’s right-wing populist triumph together makes up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have, according to the first approximate results, brought a appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections of 2006.
Worse still has finished the OVP losing 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Still at the beginning of July, when the OVP left the coalition, the populars had a considerable advantage in terms of preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, vice chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved by Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the liberals (FPO) have gained about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same would be repeated in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it came to dismember the BZ.
Haider has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is already taking his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has slightly lost and dropped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore is not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles is not solved, it could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
“If this wasn’t solved then yes, then this cooling would certainly come,” he said after the meeting that was organized on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr’vácha, who was exonerated and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“Your problem could be solved,” the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, a three-year prison sentence would be best for him to appeal to the highest authorities.
He can then request exoneration from the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises appealing to the High Court and then pardoning would be possible," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted person “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that this kind of support is already obtained by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize it too,” Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the TK said, he insisted to his colleague that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
“We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister evaded the answer to the question of whether he received a promise from the Indian side that he would take care of the matter.
“I’ve gotten a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech arbiters a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, depicting Australia surrounded by the sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small spot lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
His boss, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exposition and sometimes completes it.
He governs this talented and enthusiastic work.
The seabed still hides a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
You can find oil and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown organisms to this day that carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is greater than the firm land
Countries on the coast have begun to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
Under the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the so-called continental border which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all resources of the continental border.
"Continental edge simply means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent underwater.
It reaches to the edge of the sea coast, and often, to the boundary of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer boundaries of the Continent Edge, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
“One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist help commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward,” adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominance.
However, it also got New Zealand - the seabed surface the commission awarded it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains in their study.
The gain that will result from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also slowly submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the continental border ends begins the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty as "the common heritage of humanity".
Here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by treaties established by international institutions.
“The seabed, however, is no gold mine,” says Director Mikulka emphatically adding “that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors as well as other few states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the old Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
“An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the liberation of the hostages the German special forces command was in the place of action
To resolve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for Germany’s help – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue action.
So at the place of release were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, squadron aircraft of the federal police, of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokesmen reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany’s help to use it as support on the spot.
“Fortunately that moment did not come,” said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On September 19 in southern Egypt the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the abduction in Egypt’s southern desert region, hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible rescue payments.
Meanwhile, the saved and healthy people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return in Airbus from German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Does Not Approve Salvation Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress failed a large $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted 227 to 206 against the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action the desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked MPs to vote although the plan is not so popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investor concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
To let the program go into effect, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must be approved.
The organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened juncture the desire to travel of the Germans remains as before.
As Germany’s travel association (DVR) reported on Monday in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded sales volumes that are 31 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the GfK market research institute, reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus, the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost 11 percent higher compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the information analyzed on bookings at 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar mainly travel to the United States are in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The Germans’ preferred destination points are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized travel is highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so the sales volume compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared to last year, fell.
My first Oktoberfest
The party hits under the open sky at the endless Spa, the beer in one-liter jugs and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian costume to measure.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there’s one thing that unites us: we’re barely in the tent, photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with photos – it’s very flattering especially because I’m first at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
Cheap traditional Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany my sense of well-being in traditional Bavarian costumes until this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for that.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian suits or leather pants; none seems to be paying attention or feeling nasty - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
One Munich woman draws my attention to my apron that I had dressed in the wrong way: “the left side is single, half is virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is widow.”
Oh, God, now I'm leaning back to the left.
“It’s okay,” he says laughing.
The others don’t care about many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it’s written “To drink to get dressed!” and show, without asking, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
He looks like "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me about it after putting aside his glass of a liter of beer he just drank.
Put it right next to the fire pit, most think that's a garbage bucket.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
Others aren’t very lucky and can’t drink as much alcohol.
Around 8 p.m., sanitary groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear each time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered steps from one tent to another.
That works as with most visitors: They come sober, they come back drunk.
You don’t see who suffers from the degrees of alcoholemia and is on the go.
“They’re the ones who ‘can’t anymore,’ a health care provider answered my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Victim of an accident identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that happened on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey intended to be a member of the European Union, European powers nested the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps inland, lies one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set at the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the locker was over, there’s no question what the greatness of the company was that this was the westernmost door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that healed as far as Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen frontiers of the Cold War, it fell under
When the forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a munitions train exploded, destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then the station has fallen apart and stayed out of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed to a bunk bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shakes, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to govern a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "power bakeries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he says.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not to one or the other.
You have to do both.
“But surely at some point,” I ask, “Could Turkey be forced to choose?”
“Turkey,” he replies, “does not want to face that choice.”
He then underlines a point that almost everyone I have spoken to has recited to me almost from memory: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with all the Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically assemble those rail lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts go back to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East would, in large part, be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back across the Bosporus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt on which continent this fascinating country must claim.
Lives to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As the musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (esquela, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for those under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang its end in 1979, several of us were running out of 20 - we just refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the shape-shifting mythological being) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, whether unaccompanied or with a complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He would say, “The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
You just have to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxing, nor too florid.
Whatever the musical score, it always ended up on an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
“Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never, by any, been disappointed – otherwise, I’ve often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply “sold one or two very well-known warhorses around the world.”
We'll miss you a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25) you state that "in 1946 he resumed economic history studies at Oxford and in 1950 he won a hoplon-norman research fellowship... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctoral degree."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff’s author on Beyond Nab End, but it’s not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a hoplon-norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention for their simplicity and for the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second round for Honda's bestseller
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
Added to this are refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz arrives six years after introducing the first generation to the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period of time than that employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where the Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Around one million Jazz units have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz will allow to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 units of Jazz, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a growth of 17% in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation, the heads of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a drop of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese company also expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda is counting on the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a compact, five-door, 4.37-metre-long hybrid from which the Japanese company expects to market nearly 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented in partnership in the month of January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its dimensions.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and its wheelbase up to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - amounts to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the 1.4 engine, since the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will feature two 1.2-liter and 1.4-liter petrol engines.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower fuel consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre mechanic achieves a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This propellant - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
As for the previous engine, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horsepower, it now has 100.
This 100-horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, specifically, bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C that is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Brand Management Technology and Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Security Shield.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But most importantly are the composite eyes of the bee, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they have called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object, and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately results in collision prevention.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at right or larger angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and principal engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device just needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozens of KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we’re not talking about memory gigas, not even megas.”
This is the first step to developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in series cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation satellite system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the way.
Trembling Before Mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages at questionable solvency banks, they have created a fun and informative browser game: ‘Bad Credit Hotel’.
I mean, the bad credit hotel... or the mess.
The tedious aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and even three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful information, but not very detailed.
It’s more of a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because to buy a better house we don't even talk...
Morgan Stanley to sell stake in Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock market.
A week after discovering an interim settlement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley common stock at the unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on a unit price of $29, or 28% above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said Juan Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to behave much more cautiously than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: on Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the chief executive of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, “we thought that the stake would have been composed only of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares within a year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or so, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley says the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had eased his balance sheet a lot since late August.
The past few weeks have been exhausting for the group, which saw its stock price fall by half as the cost of insurance against a risk of defaults on its debt took off.
This cost fell last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, he is the third to vote on a bill for a new constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half of the vote plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted out of polling stations and a count from a non-governmental organization had announced a broad “yes” victory, estimating it to be between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The “Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly,” he said, congratulating Ecuadorians who lead the Guayaquil government, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The election, which will take place in full calm, according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, referred to a 444-point text that consolidated the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution entails increasing the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the “development planning” of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the draft also grants enhanced powers to the head of state, who may serve up to two consecutive terms of four years each and have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives under the poverty line.
It finally provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 people kidnapped have been released in Chad.
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped 10 days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good upon arrival at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the hijackers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since passed from one azule to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptus, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said the official, who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "blitz" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our secret service men, of the special forces," he said without going into details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an off-roader on board which were the kidnappers, of whom killed six, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also claimed that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better like that.
But a part of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or starving national historic sites?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have real laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore only the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving piles of private archives for little money, and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and desperation when promoters and leaders throw their bulldozers at our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s head of economic competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first to have suffered the crisis of the Eurozone in the context of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves more than a year ago, therefore the decisions taken regarding the Bank can in a sense be considered as precedents.
According to the decision made in the early hours of Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The bank will certainly sell a portion of its business, including mostly insurance activities purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
The actions of Fortis began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis at the institution.
Analysts agree, however, that with its 85,000 employees this bank is too big to allow it to break down.
Shares in the company fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has declined by more than two-thirds.
Looking at current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management blamed the sharp drop in Fortis shares on the insecurities of the U.S. market in connection with the approval of the $700 billion U.S. package plan.
On Monday, stocks showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new CEO.
The bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank’s clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the U.S., life and health insurance companies when viewing drug purchase data often deny signing an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
“There are personal data protection programs, which combine the use of recipe data in all cases with the approval of the given person.
The same should be in independent hands, because if not, "we entrust the chicken to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies rely on the price of insurance and the amount of compensation from the client’s health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply don’t make the contract.
Before, they sent the client to medical check-up and signed the contract with him, already knowing the result of the check-up.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the illness and health of the customer.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has little to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some drugs are multipurpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk-increasing factor for insurance companies while the former are not.
Special companies were formed to consult and process this data, which before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
The authorities are already forcing them to do so, although they have not received a fine for negligence so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and by combining them with drug consumption data they obtain more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is becoming increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
The bill that entitles the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, in spite of everything, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
Global menu of Marseille
EU doubles trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocal trading partners, this issue in addition to the other mostly global issues dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not addressed at the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Javier Solana, the main foreign policy representative, welcomed Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase their trade to more than one hundred billion euros.
Considering that between the years 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessively ambitious goal.
They have thus legally harmonised the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi only ranks ninth among the Union’s trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of the latter - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also urged, although both sides have great responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, that is, by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20%.
India also agrees with this, as at next year’s climate conference a global agreement should be reached and production of greenhouse gases should decrease by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wanted to hamper the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than 300 Italian publishers
A strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book is expected for this edition more than 7,000 exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of goods and cultural activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A print meeting will follow in Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors progressively decreases over the total of Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane missing a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett’s plane, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, were found while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on a plateau at 3,000 meters above sea level, in the Mammoth Lakes area of the Nevada Range, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
“The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have confirmation that it is the very thing that Steve Fossett was flying about on the day of his disappearance,” Anderson said.
The commissioner said no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
The 63-year-old millionaire was put to death in February.
The U.S. Transportation Security Office said a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squadron of investigators had been sent to identify the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which had been dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named after Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
By 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world tour in a hot air balloon: two solitary weeks of flight.
Three years later he had travelled the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An out-of-the-box Suv with an original, well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
This is, in short, Glk’s latest addition to the “compact” all-terrain vans in the starhouse with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Proper for the content out of the traditional, will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Glk suv, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17th.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central street of the Milanese shopping, Como Avenue, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will start with the presentation of the car in a stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue How it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will this formula be able to capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National team for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met rival fans either.
The extraction of the group is right-wing.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-colored flags showing the city of origin of the militants: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among what they had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at the time, none that had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of stadium crime, have been refused the ticket and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry is waiting to read the incoming acts of the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who has been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents visitors not only to Italian stadiums but also to those from all over Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer stand in a stadium.
Thankfully!
But now there is the fear of imitation: let those few fifty be added others.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way," the interior ministry said.
That’s why “eyes wide open” especially in view of Wednesday’s Nationals match in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia holders.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm raised during the Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappily way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that before was Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste Public Security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
“I don’t do the sociologist – adds the Observatory’s n.1 – the reactions are attributed in the countries where the fact happens.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to the anthem of Mameli: those are also not a crime, but if they allow they are not of education...”.
