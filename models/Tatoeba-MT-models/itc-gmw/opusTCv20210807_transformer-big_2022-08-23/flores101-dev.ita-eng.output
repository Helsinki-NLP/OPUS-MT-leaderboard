Komen’s policy excluded Planned Parenthood because of an ongoing investigation by lawmaker Cliff Stearns into the organization’s spending and reporting arrangements.
As chairman of the Subcommittee on Supervision and Investigations, submitted to the House Subcommittee on Energy and Trade, Stearns is trying to figure out whether taxes are being used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood.
Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney won the presidential primary of the Republican Party of Florida on Tuesday with more than 46 percent of the vote.
Newt Gingrinch, former president of the United States House, ranked second with 32 percent.
As a state with a "winner takes all" rule, Florida assigned all 50 of its delegates to Romney, leading him to the Republican Party.
According to the organizers of the protest, about 100,000 people poured into cities in Germany, including Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
Berlin police estimated the presence of 6,500 protesters.
Protests were also organised in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valletta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
Approximately 200 people demonstrated in front of the offices of some major copyright holders in London.
Last month, Poland’s signing of ACTA sparked violent protests, and this led the Polish government to decide, for the time being, not to ratify the agreement.
Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the ACTA accession process.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are once again demanding that the obligation be imposed to install closed-loop cameras in slaughterhouses across Australia.
According to the Chief Inspector of the RSPCA of New South Wales, David O'Sannessy, the ABC, the surveillance and control of slaughterhouses in Australia should be ordinary operations.
“Closed-circuit cameras would undoubtedly send a strong message to people who work in contact with animals that their well-being is top priority.”
The United States Geological Survey’s international earthquake map the week before did not report earthquakes in Iceland.
No seismic activity has been reported in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours by the Icelandic Meteorological Office.
The significant seismic activity behind the phase shift occurred on March 10 at the volcano's summit caldera, on the northeastern side.
Dark clouds at the foot of the mountain have been reported to be unrelated to volcanic activity.
The clouds created confusion as to whether an eruption actually occurred.
The Moon carried on board about 120-160 cubic meters of fuel when it broke, pushed on the breakwaters by strong winds and tidal waves.
Helicopters rescued the 12 crew members; the only injured person reported a fracture to the nose.
The 100-meter-long ship was heading to a port to carry the usual load of fertilizer. At first, officials feared that a cargo leak might occur from the boat.
The proposed amendment was already approved by the Houses in 2011.
In this legislative session, a modification was made that consists of the cancellation of the second sentence first implemented by the House of Representatives and then approved by the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence which proposes to prohibit same-sex civil unions could, perhaps, in the future, open a window for them.
At the end of the procedure, HJR 3 will be reviewed by the next elected legislature, in 2015 or 2016, in order to remain under consideration.
In addition to directing, Vautier's career included a hunger strike in 1973, which he did to fight against what he considered political censorship.
His activism dates back to World War II, when, at the age of 15, he joined the French Resistance.
It was told in a 1998 book.
In the 1960s he returned to Algeria, which had just gained independence, to teach film direction.
He died at the age of 54, the Japanese Judoist Hitoshi Saito; he won two Olympic gold medals.
The death occurred due to an intrahepatic biliary duct cancer.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
Former Olympic champion and former world champion, at the time of his death Saito was also chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation’s training committee.
The party, organized to celebrate the first anniversary of a wedding couple the year before, was attended by at least 100 people.
Officials said a formal anniversary celebration event was scheduled for another date.
The couple had gotten married the year before in Texas, then traveled to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
His 30-year-old husband, born in Buffalo, was one of four victims of the shooting, but his wife remained unharmed.
Karno is a very famous but controversial English tutor, who taught at the Modern Education and King’s Glory Institutes, and claimed to have had 9,000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes he used words considered vulgar by some parents and, it is said, pronounced obscenity in the classroom.
He was accused by Modern Education of printing big ads on buses without permission and of lying about being the main English tutor.
He was also previously charged with copyright infringement, but was not charged.
One former student said he “behaved like a friend, talking to the slang in class and giving dating advice.”
Officially China continues to be a communist state; nevertheless, over the past thirty years China has developed a market economy.
Under the government of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic reforms were initiated.
Since then, the volume of the Chinese economy has increased by 90 times.
Last year, for the first time, China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States becoming the largest market in the sector.
Within two decades, China’s GDP could be higher than that of the United States.
Tropical Storm Danielle was the fourth of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season to be given a name and took shape in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, is characterized by sustained maximum winds of 40 mph (equal to 64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will gain more strength and become a hurricane by Wednesday.
Assessing the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean is difficult as the storm is far from the mainland.
Born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, Bobek became famous playing in Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and remained there until 1958.
During his time in the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 appearances.
In the history of the club, no one has ever collected more appearances or scored more goals than Bobek.
In 1995 he was chosen as the best player in Partizan's history.
The celebrations began with an extraordinary performance by the famous company Cirque du Soleil.
The Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a band of Janissaries and singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses performed.
Then the dancing dervishes took to the stage.
Turkish star Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
Finally, the Turkish dance company Fire of Anatolia performed the performance "Troy".
13-year-old motorcyclist Peter Lenz has died in an accident on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During his warm-up lap Lenz fell off the bike and was hit by fellow rider Xavier Zayat.
Immediately assisted by the race medical staff, he was rushed to a local hospital where he later died.
Zayat came out unharmed from the accident.
On the global financial situation, Zapatero went on to argue that “the financial system is a part of the economy, and this part is fundamental.
The financial crisis we are going through has been going on for a year; the sharpest moment has been in the last two months and I now believe that in the financial markets there is a recovery.”
Last week Naked News announced plans to dramatically boost its foreign-language international news activities with three new broadcasts.
The global organization, which already broadcasts in English and Japanese, is launching programs for television, web and mobile devices in Spanish, Italian and Korean.
Luckily nothing happened to me but I witnessed a gruesome scene, when people were trying to break windows to escape.
They hit the windows with the chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
“At last one of the panels broke, and they could get out of the window,” said Franciszek Kowal, a survivor of the incident.
Stars radiate light and heat because of the energy that is released when hydrogen atoms join (or merge) with each other, forming heavier elements.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that produces energy in the same way.
However, this is a very complex issue to solve and it will take many years to achieve effective fusion reactors.
The steel needle floats on the water due to the surface tension.
The surface tension is due to the fact that the water molecules present on the surface of the water itself are strongly attracted to each other, more than the air molecules present above them.
The surface molecules create an invisible film on the hair of the water that allows objects, such as the needle, to float on it.
The blade of modern ice skates has two edges with a concave cavity between them. The double edge ensures a better grip on the ice, even when they are tilted.
The bottom of the blade is slightly curved and therefore, when the blade bends either side, the wire that is in contact with the ice also describes a curve.
And this is what allows the skater to bend. If you tilt the skates to the right, the skater curves to the right, if you tilt the skates to the left, the skater curves to the left.
To return to the previous level of energy, they must get rid of the excess energy obtained from the light.
To do this, they emit a tiny particle of light, called a photon.
This process is called "stimulated emission of radiation" by scientists; in fact, atoms are stimulated by a beam of intense light that causes the emission of a photon of light and light is a type of radiation.
The following image shows the atoms emitting photons. Obviously, in reality, the dimensions of the photons are much smaller than as illustrated in the photos.
Photons are even smaller than the matter that makes up atoms!
After working for hundreds of hours, the filament of the bulb eventually burns and the bulb stops working.
The bulb must be replaced. You need to pay attention when doing so.
First of all, you need to turn off the lamp switch, or disconnect the cable.
This is due to the risk of electric shock, caused by the electricity that passes in the socket where the metal part of the bulb is inserted, in case you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb, if still partially inserted in the socket.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which is responsible for pumping blood.
The blood flows from the heart through tubes called arteries and returns through tubes called veins. The smaller tubes are called capillaries.
Triceratops teeth were able to shatter not only the leaves, but also the most resistant branches and roots.
According to some scientists, Triceratops was fed on cycadee, a common plant species in the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like a small palm and have a kind of crown of pointed and sharp leaves.
With its sturdy beak, a triceratops could rip the leaves off and then eat the trunk.
According to other scientists these plants are very poisonous, so dinosaurs are unlikely to eat them, although today the bradip and other animals such as the parrot (which descend from the dinosaurs) are able to eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If we were on the surface of Me, we would weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg). The force of gravity, therefore, exerts less pressure on us.
The Sun, unlike the Earth, has no crust to rest on. The entire Sun is made up of gas, fire and plasma.
Gas becomes less dense the farther away from the center of the Sun.
The visible outer surface of the Sun is called the photosphere, or "sphere of light."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, observing Venus with a telescope, saw that the planet had phases, similar to those of the Moon.
The phases occur because only the face of Venus (or the Moon) facing the Sun is illuminated. The Venusian phases supported Copernicus' theory that the planets revolve around the Sun.
In 1639, a few years later, the English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
A long period of peace for England followed the recapture of Danelaw.
However, in 991 Ethelred faced a larger Viking fleet than any since Guthrum a century earlier.
At the head of the fleet was Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian driven by the ambition to take back his country by stealing it from the Danish rulers.
After a disastrous military start, Ethelred came to terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to conquer his kingdom, with alternate successes.
The Hangeul is the only alphabet intentionally invented for everyday use by the people. It was devised during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450) in 1444.
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and one of the most esteemed rulers.
At first, he called the Hangeul Hunmin Jeongeum alphabet, which means "The correct/appropriate sounds for the education of peoples."
There are many theories about the origins of Sanskrit, one of which goes back to the Arii, who migrated from the West to India and brought their own language with them.
Sanskrit is a classical language and is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The first known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the composition of the Upanishads, the Sanskrit lost importance.
Sanskrit is a decidedly rich and complex language that has given rise to many of the modern Indian languages, as well as Latin is at the origin of some European languages, such as French and Spanish.
After defeating France, Germany began to prepare for the invasion of Britain.
The attack was codenamed "Operation Sealion" from Germany. The British Army was in a fragile condition as most of its heavy weapons and supplies had been lost during the evacuation of Dunkirk.
However, the Royal Navy remained much more powerful than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy any fleet sent to invade across the English Channel.
Despite this, the Royal Navy ships stationed in the vicinity of the possible routes of conquest were very few: the admirals, in fact, feared that they would be sunk by the German air attack.
Let's start by looking at Italy's plans. Italy was essentially the "little sister" of Germany and Japan.
They had a weaker army and navy, although they had built four new boats just before the war began.
The main objectives of Italy were the African countries. To conquer those countries, it would have been necessary to have a base of departure for the troops to allow them to cross the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
So they had to get rid of the British bases and ships in Egypt. Aside from that, the Italian warships were not expected to do anything else.
Now we come to Japan, which was an insular state, just like Britain.
Submarines are boats designed to move and stay underwater for long periods of time.
The submarines were used in World War I and World War II; at that time they were very slow and had a very limited range of fire.
At the beginning of the war they traveled mostly to the surface, but as a result of the development of radar and its greater precision, submarines had to go underwater to avoid being seen.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans were very skilled at guiding and manoeuvring them.
After the war, considering their success with these naval vehicles, the Germans were considered dangerous in case they had possessed a large number of them.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes called "King Tut" or "the boy pharaoh", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.
It is interesting to note that in antiquity it was not considered very important and was not added to the annals of the oldest kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. Unlike many tombs of the past that have been looted, this has remained almost untouched.
Most of the objects buried together with Tutankhamun are well preserved, and among them are thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
With the invention of the ray wheel, Assyrian tanks became lighter, faster, and better equipped to overcome soldiers and other tanks.
Their mortal crossbows hurled arrows capable of penetrating the armor of enemy soldiers. Around 1000 BC the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. Since the saddle had not yet been invented, the soldiers of the Assyrian cavalry fought riding on the naked back of the horses.
We know many Greek political personalities, scientists and artists. The perhaps best known character belonging to this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the Iliad and Odyssey poems.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still appreciated playwrights and their dramas are considered among the major works of world literature.
Another famous Greek personality is the mathematician Pythagoras, best known for his famous theorem, which established a relationship between the sides of the rectangular triangles.
There are various estimates of the number of people who speak Hindi. It is estimated that it is between the second and fourth languages with the most speakers in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether or not closely related dialects are included in the account.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million people who speak the language, and up to 800 million people who can understand it.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary, but they are different in spelling; in everyday use, people who speak these two languages usually manage to understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was exposed to strong cultural influence from Germany.
To bring God closer to the indigenous people, some German monks invented the Estonian literary language.
It was based on the German alphabet, with the addition of the character ""/"".
Over time, many words borrowed from the German were integrated. It was the beginning of a period of inspiration.
Traditionally, at the end of the school year, the heir to the throne reached the army directly.
Charles instead attended Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied anthropology, archaeology, and later history, earning a 2:2 (lower second class).
Charles is the first member of the British royal family to graduate.
3% of the country consists of European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula).
The territory of Turkey extends over 1,600 km (1,000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, with a more or less rectangular shape.
Turkey, including the lakes, has an area of 783,562 km2 (300,948 square miles): of these, 755,688 km2 (291,773 square miles) located in Southwest Asia, and 23,764 km2 (9.174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey is by extension the 37th largest country in the world; its size roughly equals the size of metropolitan France and the United Kingdom together.
Turkey faces the sea on three sides: west of the Aegean Sea, north of the Black Sea and south of the Mediterranean Sea.
Although Luxembourg has a long history, it achieved independence in 1839.
Parts of present-day Belgium once belonged to Luxembourg, but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
Although Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, Germany occupied it both during World War I and World War II.
In 1957 Luxembourg was one of the founding countries of the organisation now known as the European Union.
Located at the top of the Paro district (in the village of Phondey), the Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fort, as well as a Buddhist monastery.
The fortress is said to have been built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel in 1649 to celebrate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongols.
In 1951 a fire broke out, of which only a few relics of the Drugkyal Dzong survived, including the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
Following the fire, the fortress has been preserved and protected and continues to be one of Bhutan’s most extraordinary attractions.
During the 18th century, Cambodia was entrenched between two very powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century Cambodia was invaded several times by the Thais, who in 1772 destroyed the capital Phnom Phen.
In the late 18th century, the country was also invaded by the Vietnamese.
18% of Venezuelans are unemployed and the majority of the employed work in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelan workers are employed in the service sector, about a quarter in industry and a fifth in agriculture.
An important industry is the oil industry, in which the country is a net exporter, although only 1% of Venezuelans work in this sector.
In the early years of the nation’s independence, the experience of the Singapore Botanical Gardens led to the island’s transformation into a tropical garden city.
In 1981, the Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid hybrid was chosen as the national flower of the country.
Every year, around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores migrate from the northern hills to the southern plains, across the Mara River, due to the rains.
Then again to the north passing through the west, crossing the Mara River again, following the rains around April.
The Serengeti region is home to Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
To learn how to create interactive media, you need conventional and traditional skills, as well as the ability to use tools in interactive lessons (creation of storyboards, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.).
In interactive design, you need to reassess your assumptions about media production and learn to think nonlinearly.
Interactive design requires the parts of a project to interact with each other, but also to act as a separate entity.
The disadvantage of using zoom lenses is that the focal complexity, as well as the number of lens elements needed to achieve a wide range of focal lengths, are far superior to fixed lenses.
Due to the ever-higher standards that manufacturers have achieved in lens production, the problem tends to no longer occur.
This allowed the zoom lenses to create images whose quality is comparable to that achieved by lenses with fixed focal length.
The use of zoom lenses has another negative aspect related to the fact that their maximum aperture (speed) is usually lower.
For this reason, in low-light conditions and without a flash, zoom lenses are difficult to use.
When trying to convert a movie to DVD format, one of the most common drawbacks is the overscan.
In general, televisions are made to satisfy the tastes of the public.
It is for this reason that all the images we see on the TV had the upper, lower and side edges cut.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen and is called overscan.
Unfortunately, when making a DVD, in all probability its edges will also be cut, and if there were subtitles placed too close to the bottom in the video, they will not be shown completely.
For centuries the typical medieval castle has stimulated the imagination, evoking scenes of rides, banquets and knights of King Arthur.
It is easy, even in the ruins of a thousand years, to recall the sounds and smells of distant battles, to perceive almost the noise of the clogs on the pebbles and smell the fear that comes from the prisons.
But our imagination is based on reality? First of all, why were castles built? How were they designed and built?
The castle of Kirby Muxloe, a characteristic example of this period, represents a fortified house rather than a real castle.
Its large windows and thin walls could not resist a resolute attack for long.
In the years from 1480, when Lord Hastings began construction, the country was relatively peaceful and the defense needed was only that against the small bands of nomadic raiders.
The balance of powers was a system under which European nations pledged to maintain the national sovereignty of every European state.
The concept was for all European nations to commit themselves to preventing a nation from achieving hegemony; for this reason national governments often modified their alliances in order to maintain balance.
The Spanish War of Succession was the first to focus on the question of the balance of power.
This marked a crucial change: the European powers, in fact, would no longer have the pretext of the wars of religion. For this reason, the last war to be called "of religion" was the Thirty Years' War.
On July 21, 356 BC, the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed by a wilful fire set by Herostratus.
It is said that his motive was notoriety at all costs. The Ephesians, offended, decreed that the name of Erostratus would never be remembered.
The same one we know today was noticed by the Greek historian Strabo later on. The same night that Alexander the Great was born, the temple was destroyed.
Alexander, as king, offered to finance the reconstruction of the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Later, after his death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while performing notes properly and also try not to make unnecessary movements with your fingers.
So you can only get tired of the essential minimum. Do not forget that to increase the volume you do not have to press the keys very hard as it does for the piano.
On the accordion, to increase the volume, it is enough to exert greater pressure and speed on the mantis.
Mysticism is a search for sharing and identification, or conscious awareness of an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer is looking for a direct experience, an intuition, or a vision of the divine reality, divinity, or deities.
Followers maintain specific lifestyles or practices aimed at nurturing such experiences.
Mysticism is distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a particular state of consciousness, especially of a peaceful, deep, blissful, if not ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent born in a region of Punjab in the fifteenth century following a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs regard their faith as a religion separate from Hinduism, despite recognizing their own roots and Hindu traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means "way of the guru". The guru, central element in all religions of India, has assumed in Sikhism such importance as to constitute the heart of Sikh beliefs.
This religion was founded in the fifteenth century by the guru Nanak (1469-1539); after him there were nine other guru.
Nevertheless, in June 1956, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test when workers in Poland began a protest against food shortages and wage cuts, which turned into a general insurgency against communism.
Although in the end, to restore order, Khrushchev sent tanks, consented to some economic demands and the appointment of the famous Wladyslaw Gomulka as new prime minister.
The Indus Valley civilization dates back to the Bronze Age and extended into the northwest Indian subcontinent, which included much of present-day Pakistan, as well as some areas of northwest India and northeast Afghanistan.
This civilization developed in the basins of the Indus River, from which it took its name.
Although some scholars rightly assume that this civilization should be called "Indo-Sarasvati civilization", since it also lived in the basins of the now-dried Sarasvati river, some call it the "Harappa civilization", from "Harappa", or the first of its sites, brought to light in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire favored the development of advances in the medical field.
The first doctors were recruited by Emperor Augustus and even constituted the first Roman health corps employed in the aftermath of the battles.
Surgeons knew of various sedatives, including morphine obtained from extracts of poppy seeds and scopolamine obtained from seeds of herbaceous plants.
They became experts in amputations to save patients from gangrene, as well as using hemostatic loops and arterial tweezers to stop blood spilling.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire saw the achievement of important milestones in the field of medicine, which laid the foundation for modern knowledge.
Origami "Pureland" is an origami characterized by some limitations: it is possible to perform only one fold at a time and no more complicated folds are allowed, such as inverse ones. In addition, all folds follow basic positions.
It was designed by John Smith in the 1970s to facilitate work for inexperienced benders or those with limited motor skills.
Since childhood, children are aware of both race and racial stereotypes and the latter influence their behavior.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority who are deemed to be stereotypically poor at school tend not to do well in school as soon as they become aware of the stereotype associated with their race.
In the ranking of the most used websites in the United States, MySpace ranks third, with a current number of profiles of 54 million.
These websites have gained great attention, especially in the field of education.
These websites have positive aspects, including the ability to easily create a class page that includes blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
Access to this page is via a simple web address that is easy to remember and type, even in the case of students with problems with keyboard use or spelling.
You can customize it to make it easier to read and you can also increase or decrease the color depending on your preferences.
Attention Deficit Disorder is a neurological syndrome whose most common triad of symptoms includes impulsivity, distractibility, hyperactivity or excess energy.
It is not a learning disability, but a learning disorder; it "impacts 3-5% of children, which is equivalent to about 2 million American children."
Children with ADD struggle to focus on things like homework, but they can focus on what they love to do, such as playing, watching their favorite cartoon, or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children have a tendency to get into trouble, since they “take on risky behaviors, trigger quarrels, and challenge authority” to stimulate their brains, as this cannot be stimulated with traditional methods.
ADD conditions relationships with peers since other children fail to understand that their level of maturity is different or why they behave or write in a certain way.
Given the change in the ability to acquire knowledge and learn, as mentioned above, the basic speed at which knowledge was acquired has also changed.
The way the information was received had changed. The point was no longer the individual memory; the focus was on the ability to remember the text.
In practice, the Renaissance significantly changed the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Hominins no longer use their hands for locomotion, to carry weights, or to swaying among trees, unlike other primates.
The chimpanzee’s hands and feet are similar in size and length, as a result of their hands supporting body weight when walking on the knuckles.
Man's hand is shorter than his foot, and the phalanges are straighter.
The shift in hand specialization from locomotion to manipulation is demonstrated by hand bone fossils dating back two to three million years.
Some believe that having several lucid dreams induced with a certain frequency can be particularly exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the product of lucid dreams, which lengthen the time period between the REM phases.
By reducing the nightly frequency of REMs, the state in which the actual sleep is experienced and the body recovers becomes rarer, to the point of creating a problem.
Everything is just as tiring as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The effect varies depending on how often your brain tries to dream lucidly each night.
From the very beginning, things did not go well for the Italians in North Africa. Less than a week after Italy's declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the British of the 11th Ussari Regiment conquered the Capuzzo Fort in Libya.
The British captured General Lastucci, commander of the Military Genius of the Italian 10th Army, and ambushed him east of Bardia.
On 28 June, it was the friendly fire that killed Marshal Italo Balbo, governor general of Libya and likely heir to Mussolini, during the landing in Tobruk.
Today fencing is practiced at various levels, from students learning to practice this sport at university to professional and Olympic competitions.
This sport mainly consists of fighting between two opponents, where one screener duels with the other.
The game of golf consists of hitting the balls to the holes using special clubs.
A regular turn involves eighteen holes, with players usually starting from the first hole of the path and ending at eighteen.
The winning player is the one who uses the fewest shots, called the deck swing, to complete the path.
The game takes place on the grass and the one that surrounds the hole, called "green", is cut shorter.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with the idea of travel: recreational tourism.
This type of tourism is when people go to places very different from those frequented in normal daily life, with the purpose of relaxing and having fun.
Beaches, theme parks and campsites are the most frequented places by recreational tourists.
When the purpose of visiting a specific place is to learn about its history and culture, then this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can choose to visit multiple points of interest in a given country or simply choose to focus on a single area.
Even the settlers, having noticed this activity, had called for reinforcements.
Among the troops that enhanced the advanced positions were the 1st and 3rd regiments of New Hampshire consisting of 200 men, under the command of Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later generals).
Stark's men took a stand along the defense on the north side of the settler post.
When low tide opened a passage along the Mystic River to the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended their defenses thanks to a small stone wall to the north, which ended on the shore of a small beach.
Gridley or Stark planted a pole about 100 feet (30 m) from the fence, giving the order not to fire until the regulars had passed it.
The American plan consisted of launching coordinated attacks from three different directions.
To prevent the arrival of any reinforcements, General John Cadwalder would launch a diversionary attack against British troops at Bordentown.
General James Ewing led 700 militiamen across the river near Trenton Ferry, then took control of the bridge over Assunpink to prevent enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault force, consisting of 2,400 men, would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, then split into two groups, one commanded by Greene and the other by Sullivan, and launch an offensive before dawn.
Moving from a quarter of a mile to half a mile, speed becomes much less important, while endurance becomes a real necessity.
Of course, a runner who wants to face a half-mile race at a certain level, a man who is able to beat the two minutes, must be equipped with a remarkable dose of speed, but above all is the endurance that needs to be trained.
The most suitable preparation for the running season involves during the winter a bit of field running associated with a workout in the gym specific to the upper body.
Correct nutritional practices alone are not enough to generate high performance, but they can have significant repercussions on the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, getting used to proper hydration, and understanding the various aspects of supplementation practices can help athletes improve their performance, as well as increase the pleasure of practicing sports.
Medium-distance racing is a relatively inexpensive sport, however, there are misconceptions about the lack of equipment needed to participate.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most of these will have little or no impact on performance.
Athletes may prefer a product even when it offers no real benefit.
We can consider the atom as one of the essential bricks that make up matter.
It is a very complex entity consisting, according to Bohr's simplified model, of a central nucleus on whose orbit electrons rotate, a bit like the planets orbiting the sun, see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge, neutrons are devoid of charge. Electrons are characterized by a negative electrical charge.
To examine the victim, you first need to inspect the scene to ensure your own safety.
As you approach the victim, pay attention to his or her location and the possible presence of automatic warning signs.
If trying to help you hurt yourself, you can only make things worse.
The study revealed that depression, fear and catastrophe mediated the relationship between pain and disability in people with low back pain.
The effects of catastrophization are the only ones to be conditioned by structured weekly sessions of physical activity, not depression and fear.
Those who participate in regular activities needed more support, in terms of negative perception of pain, to distinguish the differences between chronic pain and the feeling of discomfort due to normal physical movement.
The vision or ability to see depends on the sense organs or the eyes of the visual apparatus.
There are various eye structures, the complexity of which varies according to the needs of the body.
The various structures have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have varying degrees of acuity, plus they require different processes to interpret the signal and different numbers to function optimally.
A population consists of all the organisms of a given species within a specific geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical from the point of view of a specific phenotypic trait, they are said to be monomorphic.
Individuals who have different variants of a specific trait are called polymorphs.
In addition, colonies of legionary ants march and nest at different stages.
In the nomadic phase, during the night the legionary ants march, and then camp by day.
The colony enters a nomadic phase following the decrease in food. During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that are changed every day.
Each of these nomadic marches or rage lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The term "cell" comes from the Latin "cell", which means "small room", was first used by a microscopist who was studying the structure of cork.
The cell is the fundamental unit of every living thing; in fact all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are fundamental and essential to the study of life; it is not by chance that they are often called "the building blocks of life".
The nervous system is able to maintain homeostasis by transmitting nerve impulses throughout the body to keep blood flow moving, and without interference.
Such nerve impulses can be sent very quickly to every part of the body, protecting it from any potential threat.
Tornadoes hit a limited area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy anything as they pass.
Tornadoes uproot trees, tear axes from buildings and throw cars into the air. Among the most violent tornadoes, 2% last more than three hours.
During these monstrous storms, the winds can reach 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
For thousands and thousands of years man has been building and using magnifying glasses.
But the first true telescopes were created in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a set of two lenses to make distant objects appear closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always be part of us. It is inherent in the nature of cooperation that when the majority will have advantages, acting selfishly will generate more gains in the short term
Hopefully, most people will understand that the best choice for them in the long run is to collaborate with others.
Many people fantasize about the day when humans will be able to travel to another star and explore new worlds, some wonder what is out there, others think that on other planets they can live alien or other life forms.
But if this ever happens, it probably won’t happen for a very long period of time. The stars are so scattered that there are billions of kilometers between the stars that turn out to be “nearby”.
Who knows if one day your great-grandchildren will find themselves on an alien world and think of their ancient ancestors!
Animals are made up of many cells. They eat food and digest it internally. Most animals are able to move.
Only animals have a brain (although not all: jellyfish, for example, do not have one).
On Earth, animals are everywhere. They dig in the ground, swim in the waters of the oceans and fly in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of living organisms (things).
Cella derives from the Latin word "cella", which means small room.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you can notice that they are formed by small squares or small spheres.
The English biologist Robert Hooke, with the help of a microscope, observed small squares in the cork.
They looked like rooms. He was the first to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds have the ability to switch from one state to another without undergoing changes.
Nitrogen in gaseous form retains the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The density of the liquid state is greater, but the molecules remain the same.
Another example is water. The water compound consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, both in the gaseous state and in the liquid or solid state.
Although its physical state may change, the chemical state remains unchanged.
Time is something that surrounds us and influences our every action, but it is difficult to understand.
Time has been the subject of study by religious scholars, philosophers, and scientists for thousands of years.
We perceive time as a series of events that pass from the future to the past through the present.
Time is also the unit of measure with which we compare the duration (length) of events.
Each of us can scan the course of time by observing the repetition of a cyclic event, which is something that is repeated systematically.
Today, computers are used to manipulate images and videos.
Thanks to computers it is possible to build sought-after animations, which are increasingly present in TV and movies.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds.
In the 19th and 20th centuries it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, a people who hunted huge birds called moas.
The theory later established the idea that the Maori people emigrated from Polynesia with a large fleet and came to New Zealand to take over from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.
New evidence, however, suggests that the Moriori were a group of Maori from the mainland who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own peculiar peaceful culture.
On the Chatham Islands there was also another tribe; it was Maori from New Zealand.
They were called Moriori and, after some clashes, they were eventually wiped out.
People who have been dealing with it for decades have helped us appreciate our strengths and our passions, while at the same time honestly assessing our difficulties and even failures.
By listening to people who have shared their personal, family and organizational stories, we have obtained very useful information about the past and some of the characters who have had a positive or negative ascendancy on the culture of the organization.
Although knowing a person’s history doesn’t necessarily mean understanding their culture, it still helps people understand where they are within the organization.
By assessing successes and realizing failures, both individuals and participants can discover the values, goals and driving forces of the organization more deeply.
In this case, remembering previous examples of entrepreneurial behavior and its successes has encouraged people to open up to new changes and directions for the local church.
These success stories have mitigated fears of change, while creating positive attitudes toward change in the future.
Converged thought patterns are problem-solving techniques: they combine different ideas or fields to come up with a solution.
This type of thinking emphasizes speed, logic, and accuracy, also focusing on recognizing facts, reapplying existing techniques, and gathering information.
The most important factor of this way of thinking is: there is only one correct answer. One thinks only of two answers, namely one right and one wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or habitual procedures.
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking, are able to memorize patterns, are able to solve problems and can work on scientific tests.
Humans are by far the most gifted species in reading the minds of others.
This means that we can correctly predict what other humans perceive, understand, think, know or desire.
Fundamental among these skills is to understand the intentions of others, which allows us to solve possible ambiguities of physical behavior.
For example, if you happen to see a person breaking a car window, it’s easy to assume they’re trying to steal a stranger’s car.
If he had lost his car keys and was trying to break into his own car, he should be judged differently.
The physical phenomenon known as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (of Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (of Harvard University) is the basis of magnetic resonance imaging.
In this resonance, because of the magnetic field and radio waves, the atoms emit weak radio signals.
In 1970, physician and scientific researcher Raymond Damadian laid the groundwork for the use of MRI as a tool for making medical diagnoses.
Four years later he obtained the world’s first patent in the field of magnetic resonance imaging.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "integral" MRI scanner, which he called "Indomitable".
Asynchronous communication promotes time for reflection and reaction to others.
It allows students to adapt activities at their own pace and manage the speed of educational information.
There are also fewer time constraints and this makes working hours more flexible. (Bremer, 1998)
Through the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web, students can access information at any time.
Students can also send questions to teachers at any time of the day and expect answers in a discreetly fast time, instead of waiting until the next meeting in person.
The post-modern approach to learning offers freedom from the absolutes. There is not a single valid way to learn.
Just as there is no right thing to learn: it is the experience between the student and the knowledge presented that gives rise to learning.
This theory is supported by our current experience in the field of DIY and information-providing television programs.
It is very common to find yourself watching a television program that gives information about a process or tells of an experience that you will never take part in or whose knowledge will never be applied.
We will never repair a car, we will never build a fountain in the garden of our house, we will not go to Peru to visit the ancient ruins, nor will we restructure the house of our neighbor.
Fiber-optic submarine connections to Europe and the broadband satellite, allow Greenland to be connected to 93% of the population that has an internet line.
Your hotel or guest (if you stay in a guesthouse or private home) is likely to have Wi-Fi or an Internet-connected PC, and you’ll find an Internet cafe or a place with public Wi-Fi everywhere.
As already mentioned, although the term "Eskimo" is acceptable in the United States, it is considered despicable by non-U.S. Arctic populations, especially in Canada.
Although you might hear this word spoken by native Greenlanders, foreigners should avoid using it.
The native inhabitants of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (a Greenlandian, plural Kalaallit) in Greenland.
In Greenland, crime and hostility towards foreigners are virtually non-existent, even in cities there are "danger zones".
The only real danger for an unprepared traveler is perhaps the cold.
If you visit Greenland during the cold seasons (taking into account that the more you move north and the colder it will be), it is essential to equip yourself with fairly warm clothing.
Extensive summer days can lead to sleep problems and health problems.
During the summer period, be careful also with Nordic mosquitoes. They do not transmit diseases, but they can be irritating.
San Francisco’s economy is diverse, despite being linked to its status as a world-class tourist attraction.
The most important employment sectors are professional services, government, finance, commerce and tourism.
Music, film and popular culture have often represented the city, contributing to the world fame of the city itself and its monuments.
San Francisco has developed a large infrastructure for tourism, with numerous hotels, restaurants and excellent congress facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the best cities in the state to enjoy other Asian cuisines, such as Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
For many American families, Walt Disney World is one of the most important trips.
The typical tour schedule includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus to a Disney hotel on site, a stay of about a week exclusively within the Disney property, and return home.
There are endless possible variations, but this is what most people have in mind when it comes to “going to Disney World.”
Many tickets sold online through auction sites, such as eBay or Craigslist, are park-hopper tickets that are valid for several days and partially used.
Although it is a widespread practice, it is prohibited by Disney: tickets are not transferable.
To be able to camp under the edge of the Grand Canyon, you must obtain a permit for backcountry.
For the protection of the canyon, permits are available in a limited number and must be requested on the first day of the month, four months before the beginning of the month.
As a result, a backcountry permit will be available for any date starting in May.
The spaces available in the most popular areas, including the Bright Angel Campground which is adjacent to the Phantom Ranch, are usually filled with requests received on the first day of opening to reservations.
A limited number of permissions are available for non-booking requests, assigned in order of arrival.
Entering South Africa by car is an amazing way to admire all the beauty of the region and to reach destinations outside of the usual tourist routes.
For this purpose, with careful planning you will be able to use a normal car, however we strongly recommend a 4x4 vehicle.
When planning this trip, keep in mind that South Africa is a stable country, but neighboring countries are not always stable.
Visa requirements, as well as its costs, vary by country and depend on the country of origin.
Each country also has special laws that establish which emergency tools must be present in the car.
Victoria Falls is a city located in the western part of Zimbabwe, on the border with Livingstone, Zambia, and close to Botswana.
The city is located right next to the waterfalls: these represent the main attraction of this famous tourist destination, but it also offers many opportunities for longer stays, both for lovers of adventure and for lovers of the views.
The volume of water increases during the rainy season (November to March) so the waterfalls appear more scenic.
It is impossible not to get wet by crossing the river or walking along the paths that line the waterfalls.
On the other hand, it will be precisely because of the huge volume of water that the view of the waterfalls will be obscured; from all that water!
The KV62 is probably the best known tomb in the Valley of the Kings, the scene of Howard Carter's discovery in 1922 of the royal burial of the young king almost intact.
But, compared to most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun’s tomb is hardly worth visiting, as it is much smaller and poorly decorated.
Only the head and shoulders are visible, so anyone who wants to see evidence of the damage done to the mummy as a result of attempts to remove it from the coffin will be disappointed.
The magnificent treasures of the tomb are no longer inside, having been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
For tourists who have little time, we recommend visiting other places.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. The temple was built on a hilltop at the end of the 9th century, at the time of the reign of King Yasovarman.
It is worth climbing the hill to enjoy the dark atmosphere of this temple and the panorama over Lake Tonlé Sap.
A visit to the site you can easily combine a boat trip on the lake.
To enter the temple you need the Angkor Pass, so to go to Tonlé Sap you must remember to bring your passport.
As well as being the largest city in Israel, it is its capital, although most other countries, as well as the United Nations, do not recognize this status.
This ancient city that rises on the hills of Judea has a thousand-year-old and fascinating history.
It is the sacred city of the 3 monotheistic religions, namely Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Because of its religious significance and, above all, the many sites in the Old City area, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem boasts numerous places of historical, archaeological and cultural interest, as well as bustling shopping malls, bars and restaurants.
To enter Ecuador, Cuban citizens arriving via international airports or border entry points must have received a prior letter of invitation.
This letter must be legalized by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and must comply with certain requirements.
These requirements have been introduced to regulate the migration flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens holding a U.S. green card must contact an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain exemption from this requirement.
The passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date of travel. To prove the duration of the stay, a return ticket is required.
Tours are cheaper for larger groups, so if you are alone or in the company of a single friend, you can try meeting other people to form a group of four or six, so you have a cheaper rate per person.
In any case, it is not a thing to be underestimated, as often tourists are rushed back and forth to fill up the cars.
It actually seems to be more of a way to deceive people, convincing them that they need to pay more.
At the northern end of Machu Picchu rises this steep mountain, often the background of many photographs of the ruins.
Seen from the bottom, it looks a little scary; it’s a steep and complicated climb but people with a decent fitness should be able to complete the task in about 45 minutes.
The stone steps are present over much of the path, and in the steepest parts the steel cables constitute a supporting handrail.
That said, expect to run out of breath and be careful at the steepest points, especially when they are wet, since they can quickly become dangerous.
Near the summit, there is a small cave rather low and narrow that must be crossed.
To admire the places and wildlife of the Galapagos it is recommended to use the boat, just like Charles Darwin did in 1835.
The waters of the Galapagos are crossed by more than 60 cruise ships of various sizes, from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their place well in advance (boats are usually full in high season).
Make sure that the travel agent you are booking with is an expert in the Galapagos with a good knowledge of the various types of ships.
This will allow you to square your interests and/or special constraints with the most suitable ship.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was controlled by the Incas, while the central and southern parts of the country were inhabited by the indigenous Araucanía, the Mapuche.
The Mapuche were also among the last independent indigenous American groups: they were completely absorbed by Spanish-speaking rule only after Chile's independence.
Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars that left Spain for a couple of years without a functioning central government), but the decisive victory over the Spaniards was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country located on the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola; the other half belongs to Haiti.
In addition to having white-sand beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is home to one of the oldest European cities in the Americas, now part of Santo Domingo.
The first inhabitants of the island were the Taino and the Caribe. The Caribe were an Arawak-speaking people who arrived around 10000 BC.
The population of the Taino, within a few years of the arrival of European explorers, had been drastically reduced by the Spanish conquerors.
As stated by Fray Bartolomé de las Casas in the "Tratado de las Indias", the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 Taino between 1492 and 1498.
Jardín de la Unión. This space was the atrium of a 17th-century convent, whose only surviving building today is the Church of San Diego.
It now serves as the central square, where many things often happen, both day and night.
The garden is surrounded by several restaurants. In the afternoon and evening you can often listen to free concerts from the central pavilion.
Callejon del Kisso. Two balconies separated by just 69 centimeters, which were the scene of an ancient romantic legend.
For a few pennies, some children will tell you the story.
Bowen Island is a well-known day trip or weekend excursion, offering the opportunity to kayak, hike, visit shops, restaurants and more.
This typical community is located at Howe Sound, just outside Vancouver, and can be easily reached by line water taxis departing from Granville Island, in the city center.
For those who love outdoor activities, a hike along the Sea to Sky route is essential.
Whistler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is an expensive but well-known location due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
During the winter you can have fun skiing in one of the best ski resorts in North America, while in summer you can try the real mountain biking.
Permits must be booked in advance. To stay in Sirena you need a permit.
Sirena is the only Ranger station that offers, in addition to camping, temporary accommodation in the dormitory and hot meals. In La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos there are campsites, but not the catering.
Parking permits can be purchased directly at Puerto Jiménez Ranger Station, but credit cards are not accepted.
The parking service (MINAE - Ministry of Environment and Energy) does not issue parking permits more than one month in advance of the expected arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a booking service at the price of $30, or $10 for daily passes; details are available on the operator's Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands are located in Polynesia, in the center of the South Pacific Ocean; they are an island state in free association with New Zealand.
It is an archipelago consisting of 15 islands distributed over an ocean surface of about 2.2 million km2.
The islands, which have the same time zone as Hawaii, are sometimes considered in the same hemisphere as Hawaii.
As small as it is, to some older travelers the island reminds Hawaii before they became a state, without the big tourist hotels and other transformations.
The Cook Islands consist of 15 different islands, the main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki, but there are no cities.
Today in developed countries offering luxury bed & breakfast facilities has become almost an art form.
Higher-end B&Bs naturally compete especially with bed linen and breakfast.
In fact, in the most refined structures of this category it is easy to find elegant sheets, handmade quilts or vintage beds.
Breakfast can include seasonal delicacies typical of the area or a specialty of the landlord.
The setting can be a historic building with antique furnishings, beautiful gardens and a swimming pool.
Getting in the car and going to a faraway destination has the intrinsic charm of simplicity.
Compared to the larger vehicles, you will surely already have a certain familiarity with your car, and you know the limits.
Mounting a tent on a private property or in a city, small or large, can easily be the subject of unwanted attention.
In summary, your car is a great choice for a road trip, but it is hardly, as such, a good means of "camping".
Camping by car is possible if you have a van, SUV, sedan or station wagon with folding seats.
Some hotels boast traditions dating back to the Golden Age, the era of railroads and steam transatlantics prior to World War II, between the 19th and early 20th centuries.
These hotels were located in the places where the rich and famous people of the time stayed and often offered fine cuisine and nightlife.
Old-style furnishings, the absence of the latest equipment and a certain timeless grace contribute to their character.
Although they are generally privately owned, they sometimes house heads of state and other visiting authorities.
A traveler with a lot of money might consider the idea of a flight around the world, with stops to stay at many of these hotels.
A hospitality exchange network is an organization that allows travelers to get in touch with the people who live in the cities they go to visit.
Usually to enter such a network it is enough to fill out an online form, although some networks offer or require additional verification processes.
A list of available hosts is then provided, in paper and/or online format, which can sometimes be complete with references and reviews from other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 after programmer Casey Fenton had found a cheap flight to Iceland, but had not found accommodation.
He contacted the students of the local university via email and received an exorbitant number of free accommodation offers.
Hostels are mostly aimed at young people (a typical guest is in their twenties), but it is often also possible to find more mature travelers.
It is rare to see families with children, but some hostels host them in private rooms.
The city of Beijing, China, will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, becoming the first city to host both the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening ceremony and closing ceremony, as well as indoor ice events.
In the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing, further skiing events will take place.
Most temples hold an annual festival beginning from late November to mid-May, which varies according to the annual calendar of the individual temple.
Most temple celebrations take place as part of the festivals organized for the temple anniversary or the deity’s birthday presiding over the temple or for any other important celebration associated with it.
Kerala’s temple festivals are very fascinating to see, with the numerous processions of elephants barbed to party, the temple orchestra and other celebrations.
World Fair (usually also called World Expo or simply Expo) is an international festival of arts and sciences.
The participating countries offer artistic and educational exhibitions in the national pavilions to expose the themes of the world or the culture and history of their country of origin.
The international horticulture exhibitions are events dedicated to the exhibition of floral compositions, botanical gardens and everything that has to do with plants.
Although they can theoretically take place every year (provided in different countries), in practice this does not happen.
Generally these events last between three and six months and take place in areas not less than 50 hectares.
There are many different film sizes, which have been used over time. The most common is the standard 35 mm film (negative 36x24 mm).
It can usually be replenished quite easily if it runs out, and it guarantees a resolution more or less comparable to that of an existing DSLR.
Some medium-sized analog cameras use dimensions of 6x6 cm, more precisely a negative of 56x56 mm.
This offers a resolution almost four times higher than a negative of 35 mm (3,136 mm2 vs. 864).
Wildlife is one of the most difficult subjects for a photographer: it needs a combination of several factors including luck, patience, experience and suitable equipment.
Naturalistic photography is often almost taken for granted, but as with photography in any field, an image has more value than thousands of words.
Naturalistic photography often requires a long telephoto lens, although they serve other lenses for subjects such as a flock of birds or a small creature.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find and commercial photos are regulated by the regulations of some parks.
Wild animals can be elusive or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or in any case hostile.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, over 20 of which have at least 50 million speakers.
In addition, written words are often easier to understand than spoken words. This applies especially to addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce clearly.
In many countries, English is spoken very well, but in many others, knowledge of the language is limited, especially among young people.
Try to imagine, if you like, a citizen of Manchester, a Boston, a Jamaican and a Sydney man sitting around a dinner table in a Toronto restaurant.
They entertain each other with stories of their native cities, narrated with their distinctive accents and in local jargon.
The most convenient way to eat is usually to buy food at the supermarket. However, if you do not have the opportunity to cook, the choices are limited to ready-made foods.
More and more supermarkets offer a department with an increased choice of ready-made foods. Some even offer microwave ovens or other means to heat food.
In some countries or in some types of shops there is at least one indoor restaurant, often quite informal with affordable prices.
Produce copies of your policy and the insurer's contact details and take them with you.
They must show the insurer’s e-mail address and international phone numbers for recommendations/authorizations and to claim compensation.
Keep another copy in your suitcase and online (on email as an attachment or saved in the cloud).
If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, keep a copy in your memory or on your disk (accessible without internet).
Also distribute copies of the policy/contact to fellow travelers and relatives or friends at home, eager to provide help.
Elche (or wasps) are not by nature aggressive, but defend themselves if they perceive a threat.
If people underestimate the potential dangers of elk, they may get too close to them and take risks.
Drink alcohol responsibly. Alcoholic beverages have a different effect on everyone, and knowing your limit is very important.
Possible long-term health events related to alcohol abuse may include liver damage and still blindness or death. The potential danger increases with illegally produced alcohol consumption.
In illegal alcohols there can be various types of dangerous impurities including methanol, which, even in small doses, can result in blindness or death.
Eyeglasses can be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries where labor costs are lower.
Consider taking an eye exam at home, especially if insurance covers it, and taking the prescription with you to present it where required.
The luxury brand frames available in these areas can present two types of problems: some can be imitations and imported authentic ones can be more expensive than those purchased in your country.
Coffee is one of the most traded goods in the world and you will likely find various types in your region of origin.
However, in the world there are many characteristic ways to drink coffee, which is worth trying.
Canyoning (or canyoneering) is the descent to the bottom of a gorge, which can be dry or filled with water.
Torrenting combines elements of swimming, climbing and jumping; however, relatively little training and fitness is needed to get started (compared to training and fitness required, for example, for rock climbing, scuba diving or alpine skiing).
Hiking is an activity that takes place in the open air and involves walking in natural environments, often on specific paths for hiking.
Day trips include distances ranging from less than a mile to longer distances that can still be traveled in a single day.
Day trips on an easy trail require little preparation and any moderately fit person can enjoy them.
An outdoor day is also possible for those with infants and preschoolers, although families with young children may require more preparations.
There are approximately 200 running tour organizations around the world. Much of these operate independently.
Go Running Tours, successor to Global Running Tours, creates networks of dozens of sightruning providers spread across four continents.
Rooted in Running Tours Barcelona and Running Copenhagen, we quickly added Running Tours Prague and others.
When deciding to embark on a journey, you need to consider various aspects, both before departure and in itineraries.
When traveling you have to be aware that things are not like at home. Behaviors, laws, food, traffic, housing, norms, language and so on will be partly different from those of the place where you live.
This is an aspect to always keep in mind to avoid disappointment or even aversion to local habits.
The emergence of travel agencies dates back to the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a valid alternative for a trip that transcends a traveler’s previous experience in nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although most agencies accept regular bookings, many of them are specialized in particular types of travel, price ranges or destinations.
Addressing an agent who often book similar trips can be the best choice.
Take a look at the travels promoted by the agent, both on the website and in the showcase.
If you want to visit the world by spending little, for necessity, lifestyle or challenge, there are different ways to do it.
Basically, they fall into two categories: work while traveling, or try to limit expenses. In this article we take care of the second.
For those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability in order to reduce expenses as much as possible, consult the entry on travel at the lowest budget.
The advice is based on the assumption that travelers do not steal, violate private property, participate in the illegal market, ask for alms, or otherwise exploit other people to their advantage.
The immigration checkpoint is usually the first stop after disembarking from an airplane, ship, or other means of transport.
On some cross-border trains the checks take place during the ride, so you must always carry a valid identity document when boarding such trains.
Sometimes, on night trains, it is the driver who picks up the passports to avoid interrupting the sleep of the passengers.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa issuance process. In some countries it is necessary to indicate your residence and address to the local authorities.
To do this, you may need to fill out a form with the local police or go to the immigration office.
In many countries where this type of law is in force, local hotels will handle registration (ask for greater security).
In other cases, registration is only required for those staying outside the accommodation facilities. This, however, makes the law less clear, so it is advisable to inform yourself in advance.
Architecture has to do with the design and construction of buildings. The architectural elements of a place are often a full-fledged tourist attraction.
Many palaces are quite beautiful to see and the panorama from a tall building or a skillfully positioned window can be a pleasure for the eyes.
Architecture significantly overlaps with other areas of activity such as urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and exterior design.
Considering the considerable distance of many of the pueblos, you can find a bustling nightlife only by traveling to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above serve to drink and many of them offer upscale entertainment (especially the larger ones around Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Attention: here the bars of small towns are not always suitable places for a visitor who comes from another state.
First, in northern New Mexico drunk driving is a big problem; there is a high concentration of drunk drivers in close proximity to bars in small towns.
Graffiti is defined as unwanted murals or drawings.
Although this phenomenon is far from modern, most people could associate it with young people smearing public and private property with spray paint.
Nowadays, however, there are also recognized artists, events and "legal" walls in graffiti. In these contexts, graffiti looks more like real works of art than unreadable symbols.
The launch of the boomerang is a valued skill, which many tourists want to acquire.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang so that you turn back, you must first make sure that your boomerang is suitable.
Most of the boomerangs available in Australia do not actually go back. For beginners, it is better not to try to throw in the presence of wind.
In the traditional hangi meal, food is cooked in a preheated hole in the ground.
The pit can be heated with rounded stones on the fire, or in some areas it is geothermal heat that naturally heats certain parts of the ground.
The hangi method is often used to prepare a traditional "barbecue" style dinner.
There are several places in Rotorua where you can find geothermal hangi; other hangi can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and other places.
MetroRail offers two tariff categories on commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called First Class) and Metro (called Third Class).
The MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded but a little more expensive, although it is still cheaper than a regular subway ticket in Europe.
Each train has both Metro and MetroPlus carriages; the latter are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Transport for others - Never leave your own bags where they cannot be seen, especially when crossing international borders.
You may discover that you have been used, without your knowledge, as a drug courier, then having to face many problems.
For example waiting in line, since anti-drug dogs could be involved at any time without any notice.
Some countries have very severe penalties even when the crime is committed for the first time; these include prison sentences of more than 10 years or the death penalty.
Unguarded purses are exposed to theft and can also arouse the attention of authorities, who fear possible bombs.
At home, given this constant exposure to local germs, the chances of being already immune to them are very high.
However, in other parts of the world, where bacteriological fauna is new to you, there are much more likely to run into problems.
In addition, in the presence of warmer temperatures the bacteria grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Here, then, are the scourges of the “belly of Delhi,” the “curse of the pharaoh,” the “vengeance of Montezuma” and their many friends.
Similar to respiratory disorders in colder climates, intestinal disorders in warmer climates are quite widespread; they are almost always very annoying, but they cannot be considered really dangerous.
If you’re visiting a developing country or a new part of the world for the first time, don’t underestimate the possibility of cultural shock.
Many capable and balanced travelers have been overwhelmed by the novelty of traveling to parts of the developing world, where so many small cultural adaptations can quickly be concentrated.
Especially in the early days, as an aid to settling in, you could indulge in the luxury of Western-style hotels, food and quality services.
Do not sleep on the floor on a mattress or mat in places where the local fauna is not known.
If you choose to camp, bring with you a camping pad or a hammock to keep yourself away from snakes, scorpions and the like.
In the morning, wrap your home with the aroma of an intense coffee and in the evening with that of a relaxing infusion of chamomile.
When you are on holiday at home, you have time to indulge in something pleasant and spend a few more minutes preparing a special break with tea or coffee.
If you feel in the mood to experiment, take the opportunity to prepare juices or smoothies:
Perhaps this is an opportunity to discover a simple drink to prepare for breakfast once your daily routine has resumed.
If there are different drinking cultures in your city, visit the bars or pubs in the neighborhoods you don’t frequent.
For those who are not familiar with medical jargon, the terms "infectious" and "contagious" have different meanings.
Infectious disease is that caused by pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi or other parasites.
A contagious disease spreads easily while in the vicinity of an infected person.
Many governments require incoming visitors and outgoing residents to be vaccinated against a range of diseases.
These are requirements that often depend on which countries a traveler has visited or intends to visit.
Charlotte, North Carolina’s strengths include the wide variety of quality options available to families.
Residents of other regions often refer to the family-friendly environment as the main reason to settle there and visitors often point to the city as a pleasant place to live with children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of child-friendly options in Charlotte’s Uptown area has increased exponentially.
Typically, in Charlotte, taxis are not used by families, although they may prove useful in some circumstances.
If the passengers are more than 2 an extra charge is provided: then this option may prove more expensive than it should be.
Antarctica surrounds the South Pole and is the coldest point on Earth.
Sightseeing is expensive and requires good physical fitness, is only possible in the summer period, from November to February, and is mostly limited to the peninsula, the islands and the Ross Sea.
In the summer, mainly in these areas, two thousand employees live in about fifty bases, while during the winter months only a small number of people remain.
The Antarctic hinterland is a plateau covered by 2-3 km of ice.
Sometimes the specialized air tours are pushed inland, for purposes related to mountaineering or to reach the Pole, equipped with a large base.
The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a 1,600 km route that connects McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
It consists of compacted snow where the cracks have been filled and flagged. It can only be traveled using specialized motors that tow sleds with fuel and supplies.
These means are not very agile, so the path must undergo a long detour around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau.
The most common causes of injury in winter are linked to roads, sidewalks and above all slippery steps.
Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, and sometimes some winter boots are too.
The toothing of the sole must be sufficiently deep, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material must remain sufficiently soft at low temperatures.
In slippery conditions, there are nailed boots or crampons to apply on heels or heels and soles that fit most shoes and boots.
The heels must be low and wide. On roads and pedestrian streets are often scattered sand, gravel or salt to improve the grip.
Lawns are not an anomalous phenomenon; there is a limit to the amount of snow that the steep slopes can hold and the excess volumes will descend downstream like avalanches.
The fact is that the snow is sticky, so to detach it needs a kind of push and often this push is represented by a small amount of snow that detachs.
Sometimes the cause is the heat of the sun that warms the snow, other times it is the further snowfall, other times still natural events of another kind, often the cause is man.
A tornado is an extremely low-pressure air vortex that sucks inward and upward from the surrounding air.
They give rise to strong gusts of wind (often up to 100-200 miles per hour) and are able to lift heavy objects into the air and carry them along with the tornado.
They initially look like funnels that descend from storm clouds and become "tornado" as they touch the earth.
Personal VPN providers are a great way to evade both political censorship and commercial geographic IP filtering.
They are considered better than web proxy for a number of reasons: first, they redirect internal Internet traffic, not just http traffic.
They usually provide higher bandwidth and higher quality of service. Being encrypted makes it even harder to spy on them.
Media companies regularly lie about the purpose of coding, arguing that it is to “prevent piracy.”
In fact, regional codes do not affect illegal copies in any way. Any bit-by-bit copy of a disk works very well on any device, as if it were the original.
The real goal is to give these companies more control over their markets: it’s all about cash flows.
Since calls are made via the Internet, you do not need to use a telephone company located where you live or travel.
You don’t even have to ask for a phone number that fits the local district you live in: from the wild Chicken region of Alaska, you can get a satellite internet connection with a number apparently located in sunny Arizona.
Often to be reached by PSTN phones you need to buy a global number separately. The place where the number belongs makes a difference for the people who call.
Real-time text translation apps: Applications that automatically translate entire portions of text from one language to another.
Some of the applications in this category can even translate texts on signs or other real-world objects into foreign languages when the user points the smartphone at them.
Translation engines have had a noticeable improvement and are now often able to provide more or less accurate (and more rarely incomprehensible) translations, however it is still possible that they are completely wrong, so you need to pay attention.
One of the main apps in this category is Google Translator which, once the required language data is downloaded, allows offline translation.
The easiest and cheapest way to navigate outside of your country can be by using GPS navigation apps installed on your smartphone.
It can be cheaper than not buying new maps for GPS or a standalone GPS device, or renting one at a car rental.
The operation of the phone may be limited or impossible if a data connection is not available or if it is out of reach.
Every corner store offers a complex variety of prepaid phone cards, which can be used by both phone booths and regular phones.
Although most cards are good for calling any country, some specialize in providing advantageous calling rates to specific groups of countries.
Access to these services is usually through a free number that you can call for free from almost any phone.
The rules of traditional photography also apply to video recording, and not only.
If there is a ban on taking photos, you shouldn’t even consider recording a video.
If you are using a drone, you need to check in advance what you can film and what kind of additional permits or licenses are required.
Piloting a drone near an airport or over crowded areas is generally an unfortunate choice, although it is not considered an illegal practice in your region.
Nowadays it is rare to book flights directly with the airline without first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the same flight can appear with widely different prices in the different aggregators and before booking it is worth comparing the results and consult the website of the company.
Although as a tourist or for a business trip you may not need a visa for short visits to certain countries, your stay as an international student generally requires a longer stay than that of an occasional tourist.
In general, staying in any foreign country for an extended period of time requires obtaining a visa in advance.
The requirements and application procedures for student visas are usually different from those for regular tourist or business visas.
For most countries, you will need a letter of offer from the institution you want to study at, as well as having to prove that you have sufficient funds to support yourself for at least the first year of the course.
For more details on the prerequisites, contact the institution and the immigration department of the country where you want to study.
With the exception of diplomats, when working abroad, you generally have to present income tax in the country where you reside.
Income tax is calculated differently by country, with rates and scales varying from country to country.
In some federal countries such as the United States and Canada, income tax is collected at both the federal and local levels, so there may be variations in rates and income scales from region to region.
If immigration control is usually absent or just a formality upon return home, customs checks can turn out to be a nuisance.
Make sure you know what you can bring with you and what is forbidden, and declare anything that goes beyond the limits allowed by law.
The easiest way to get into the field of travel writing is to hone your skills with an established travel blog website.
Once you have acquired familiarity with formatting and editing on the web, then you will be able to create your own website.
Volunteering during a trip is an excellent way to make a difference, but it’s not just about giving.
Living and volunteering abroad is a great way to experience a different culture, meet new people, get to know yourself better, broaden your perspectives and acquire new skills.
It can be a good way to increase your budget and afford a longer stay, as many volunteer jobs offer food and accommodation and some even provide a small salary.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. It is still possible to use some of these routes. Special permits may be required, sometimes difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic Channel connects the Arctic to the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, in most cases via rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga: this way reaching from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible.
Once you reach the marinas, everything will be quite obvious. It will be possible to meet other boat hitchhikers who will be happy to share their information.
Basically, you’ll have to distribute alerts where you offer your help, walk up and down the quays, approach the people cleaning their yachts, try to get in touch with the sailors at the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while everyone will know you and give you directions on what boats they are looking for.
It is good to carefully choose the airline within an airline alliance for the frequent flyer.
Although you may think that it is appropriate to enroll with the airline with which you fly more, it is good to consider that the advantages offered are often different and the points for frequent flyers may be greater at a different airline of the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have greatly intensified their services in Africa and, at competitive prices compared to other European airlines, offer connections to many major African cities.
Since 2014, Turkish Airlines has reached 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have more time for the trip, you can compare your total fare to Africa with the fare around the world.
Do not forget to calculate the additional costs for additional visas, exit taxes, land transport and more for all locations outside of Africa.
If you want to fly throughout the Southern Hemisphere, you have a limited choice of flights and destinations due to the lack of transoceanic routes.
No air alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the southern hemisphere (and SkyTeam covers none).
However, Star Alliance flights cover almost everything except the South East Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti: this area is covered by LATAM Oneworld.
If you prefer to avoid the South Pacific and the west coast of South America (see below), there are other possibilities besides this flight.
In 1994, the Armenian-majority Azerbaijani region of Nagorno-Karabakh declared war on the Azerbaijanis.
With Armenian support, a new republic was established, but it is not officially recognized by any established nation, not even Armenia.
Relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan continue to be compromised by diplomatic discussions on the region.
The canal district (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century district that surrounds Amsterdam’s Binnenstad.
The entire district is declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its unparalleled cultural and historical value. In addition, its real estate value is among the highest in the country.
Located in the Liguria region of Italy, the Cinque Terre encompasses the five small coastal towns of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso.
They are part of the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, the inhabitants of these places have expertly built terraces to exploit these rugged and steep lands, building up on the cliffs overlooking the sea.
The lack of a concrete corporate development is part of its charm. Trails, trains and boats connect the villages, not reachable by car.
The variations of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French spoken in France, although they are sufficiently similar to be mutually comprehensible.
In particular, in Belgium and in French-speaking Switzerland the numbering system has some subtle peculiarities, which differentiate it from that of French spoken in France, moreover the pronunciation of some words is a little different.
However, Belgians and French-speaking Swiss at school study standard French, so they can understand you even if you use the standard French numbering system.
In various parts of the world, hand greeting is a friendly gesture that means “hello.”
However, in Malaysia, or at least in rural areas, it has the meaning of "come here", just like the index finger flexing towards the body, a gesture used in some Western countries, and should be used only for this purpose.
Similarly, a British traveler in Spain may mistake a farewell gesture with his palm facing the person who is greeting (and not the person who is being greeted) as a gesture pointing back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages, created with the intention of facilitating communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating with each other.
They are distinguished from free languages, natural or organic languages that, for one reason or another, become the dominant language for communication between people of different languages.
Due to the heat of the day, it can happen to travelers to experience mirages, which give the illusion of seeing water (or something else).
They can be dangerous: if the traveler chases the mirage, he will consume precious energy and residual water.
Even the warmest desert at night can get extremely cold. Without warm clothing there is a real risk of hypothermia.
Especially in the summer, if you plan excursions in the rainforest, you need to be careful of mosquitoes.
Even if you drive in the subtropical rainforest, it only takes a few seconds with the doors open when you get on the vehicle to get the mosquitoes on board.
Bird flu, or more formally avian flu, can infect both birds and mammals.
Fewer than a thousand cases have been reported in humans, but some of them have proved deadly.
The majority of cases involved poultry farmers, but there is a certain risk for bird watchers as well.
The fjords and steep valleys, typical of Norway, suddenly give way to a more or less uniform plateau.
These plateaus are often called "vides", which means a large open space without trees, an endless expanse.
In Rogaland and Agder they are generally called hei, a term for a treeless moor usually covered with hedgehog.
The glaciers are not stable, but move down the mountain. This gives rise to the formation of cracks, voragini, cracks, which sometimes remain hidden by snow bridges.
The walls and ceiling of the ice caves are subject to collapses and cracks can close again.
From the margins of the glaciers, huge blocks detach, which then fall and sometimes move away from the glacier by bouncing or rolling.
The peak of the tourist season for hilly destinations normally occurs during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different beauty and charm during the winter, when several hill stations are covered with a good amount of snow and activities such as skiing and snowboarding are possible.
Only a small number of airlines still offer fares for trips due to mourning, offering small discounts in case of trips related to sudden mourning.
Airlines that can offer this service include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa (for flights departing from the United States or Canada) and WestJet.
In any case, it is necessary to make a telephone reservation directly with the airline.
