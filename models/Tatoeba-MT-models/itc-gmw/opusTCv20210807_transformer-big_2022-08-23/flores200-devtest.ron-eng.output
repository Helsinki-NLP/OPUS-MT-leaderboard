USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and the sport they practice, may be better served by implementing significant changes in our organization than by withdrawing certification.

This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered with feathers, an already widespread hypothesis, but provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the feather of this animal was brown-brown at the top, with a light or orange color at the bottom.
The discovery also provides insight into how the feathers of birds evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed spindle, called rahis, but present other characteristic elements of the feathers – beards and beards – the researchers concluded that the rahis was probably an evolutionary development arising from the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for impression. The researchers suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feather and not chicken puff.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feather and not the fluff of a chicken.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two policemen and injured more than 20 people.

They found that the Sun functions according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system has proven to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used in combination to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic inversions.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces produced between the galaxy’s dark matter and the Milky Way’s dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of aura and is composed of a lot of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant is “very disturbing and worrisome because of the very high mortality rate.”
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll says, and at least two were hospital staff.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis appears to be still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at one time in South Africa.

“All entrances to caves, which have been called ‘The Seven Sisters’, are between 100 and 250 meters (328 to 820 feet) in diameter.”
Infrared images show that the temperature difference between night and day indicates the likelihood that they are caves.
“They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is compatible with the hypothesis that they would represent deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeological Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and of the University of Arizona, North Flag.
In France, voting has traditionally been a bit of a technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a sheet of pre-printed paper into an envelope that indicates which candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, he leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that there are no envelopes added, except for those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness at all stages of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

Police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: “We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.”
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the charges appeared in front of the courts with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit her, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road was temporarily closed until emergency services pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Sheriff's Court in Edinburgh.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered as her image was widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have decided that publishing photos can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about suspects.”
The Crown Procurator’s Office, which is charged with prosecution, told reporters that it would not make any further comments until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants drawn based on the pre-war borders in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel claims to have a continued military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept that presence only for a period of five years.
Hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by the foresters, the test being monitored and its effectiveness subject to evaluation.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sports Hunters Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the Hunting Program of the Sports Hunters Association.
According to Mick O’Flynn, NPWS’ Executive Director for Conservation and Park Heritage, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation benefited from comprehensive safety and training training.
Martelly swore an oath yesterday before a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), made up of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth zip code in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to direct the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns in four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MECI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported another 34 overheating incidents, which the company said were “not serious.”
The ministry responded by saying Apple’s postponement was “truly regrettable.”
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Alert Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has held tourists hostage in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, along with Philippine photographs.
Later, photos took the place of an elderly woman who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working for the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began in his spare time to investigate early labor.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua said government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
The wrestlers also paid homage to the moon.
“Tommy Dreamer said that ‘The Moon was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. The Moon died in the night by two months. A unique moment as it was. A strong woman.”.
“Dustin Runnels, nicknamed ‘Golden Dust’, commented, ‘The moon was as eccentric as me... maybe even more... I love it and I’ll miss it... I hope it’s in a better place.’”
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II’s reign ended.
34% of those surveyed agree with this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia’s last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympics was to swim at the Commonwealth Games, in the 100m and 200m freestyles, as well as in three tackles, but his physical condition was questioned because of his complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to control the pain, which were prohibited during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
Several people verified the discovery before the beginning of February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water supply for the earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and maintain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his rule earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as representing “political chatter and nonsense.”
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to travel shorter distances, thus saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on the use of satellites, as opposed to older ground-based radar systems, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and transmit more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transportation is available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and public transport parking and parking facilities are not available in the area.
The fears about the lack of means of transport brought into question the possibility of organizing the party with closed doors, in the absence of the supporters of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to the reproduction between endemic Darwinian cinteses, Strong Geospiasis, and an immigrant cactus cintesosus, Conirostris Geospiasis.
Gold can be worked in a multitude of patterns. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into thin threads that can be twisted and braided. It can be beaten with the hammer or laminate in the form of sheets.
It can be made so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be prepared using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkalic) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, form a ball of them.
The moisture present on the hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewerage system.
Remains of the sewerage systems were found in the homes of minion cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used in common.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you do it through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and sight.
It takes a huge 100-foot rocket to take a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has offered us was to provide us with a much easier and faster transport.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them we have several medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free pet cats) who eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of the niche; each feline has its own role to fulfill, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called herds.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals with surprisingly lion-like behavior (but not other large cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, make long-distance jumps, and shoot with a force five times greater than that of a strong man.
Tigers fall into the same group (the genus Panthera) with lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can rage.
The tiger's roar does not resemble the full-voice roar of a lion, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents or birds. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than this.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) with the help of the smell, sweetening the ground to find them.
Thanks to night vision, they can see very well in the dark and can move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the environment in which they are, then throwing themselves over the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) comes to be isolated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river or if they move to a new island, from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we can no longer say they are the same species.
This process is called the species, which means the formation of new species. The species is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale (i.e., flush out of their lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis. In addition, they make shade.
We make our homes out of plants and we make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaurus was the peak predator of his time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurus.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth like a blade, along with an extra set in the sky of his mouth, which means that nothing that appeared in his way would escape.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a forked tongue. Its food included turtles, big fish, other species of mossaurians and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex could cope with it.
While most of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a cobra.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate while sitting in their chairs, rich men liked to have banquets where they sat on their sides while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not include dishes that arrived in Europe, America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient novel ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of that god.
People were offering sacrifices to the gods, and priests were trying to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an internal sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurates were also built.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family takes place outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just the counters that gave way to the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
In the Scandinavian saga it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of the discoveries he made, tribes of Eskimos were already living in those places at the time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in terms of population, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a map of a treasure.
“Behind the declaration of independence can be read the words: ‘The original of the Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776.’ The text appears reversed, at the bottom of the document.”
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is still known that, at its inception, the large parchment document (measure 293-4 inches per 241-2 inches) had been kept rolling.
So, the signage was probably made simply for labeling.
The Z-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
“It was run by the French ‘from Vichy,’ they were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked alongside the invaders instead of fighting them.”
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, calling it Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American forces along with the Free French had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a group of significant great people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, i.e. civil, being related to the Latin civilis, i.e. citizen, and to the civitas, i.e. life or city-state; it also defines in a way the size of society.
State cities are the precursors of nations. A civilizing culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural footprint and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as actual civilizations.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – the Congress being its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to implement its decisions.
It also had no authority to overturn laws and tax rates between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, ranks second in the world's most successful teams and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
There are nearly 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's island groups, it is often said that Japan is geographically an "archipelago."
Taiwan began long ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name as Formosa Island.
In 1624, the East Dutch Indian Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation into aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant size of the film from the end of the analogue film era.
It is also produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the digital camera’s image sensor formats.
The size of 35 mm, somewhat confusing, is actually 36 mm in width per 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore declared to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are identical to or very close to this proportion.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in a picture.
According to it, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame in thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and strong, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to each other, despite differences in language and customs.
His ubiquitous power affected everyone, from the king to the ordinary mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the principle was indeed respected.
Shortly after the hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, disrupting the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international law provisions, enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire ocean areas, putting even neutral ships at risk.
The answer to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unrestrained submarine war.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with only four cents in his pocket, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former job manager) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different periods of time; each stage of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
Also, the periods between consecutive dynasties were marked by divided provinces. The best-known interval of this kind was the Three Kingdoms Period, over 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were gruesome wars between the nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to occupy the throne of Xi'an's grand palace.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to be successful.
The same goes for the military, because instead of the class-based armed hierarchy, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in things that went beyond the worldly. He used to go often to meditate in a cave that came to be known as the “Hira”, located on Mount “Noor” (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, allows us to form a living picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is hard to find even when you know its existence. Once you get inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has stood to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau, also called the 'Giza Necropolis', in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a series of temples and the great Sphinx."
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, hollows and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
‘The upside marking looks like a V, and the downside marking looks like a clasp or a square that lacks the downside.’
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow; down means you have to start at the frog (i.e. the side of which you grab the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A bow-up feature usually generates a softer sound, while a down feature is stronger and more determined.
Do not hesitate to signify your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for bow features are there for musical reasons and normally must be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (the 11-year-old Marie Thérèse and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd screaming and shouting threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippine state were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear much of the expenses and interest related to bonds placed on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses on Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The period in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the epoch of European history spanning the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a related logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
“Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has ‘effects’ on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.”
For example, one could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce car ownership costs.
A large number of car owners lead to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for the healing of personal injury.
An important component of romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than arbitrary imposed laws.
As Paris is considered the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began to spread around 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status was in decline during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silk and spices more valuable than what the markets of Byzantium offered.
This was when the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years ago.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advances of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture made to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological system that uses preserved seeds from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers dealt with subsistence farming and this still happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel pushed aside by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of the characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to be inspired in a few unfortunate cases by children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
“Such children are called ‘untamed’ or savage. Some savage children have been kidnapped by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to rejection by the parents, due to severe intellectual or physical deficiencies.”
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for him, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding or yard method is not a learning method, but rather a helper that provides support to people who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scales can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little man staples in Microsoft Office.
Virtual shelves are included in the software, with the purpose of interrogating, providing clues, and explaining procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in family care for numerous reasons, ranging from negligence to abuse, going even to extortion.
There shouldn’t be children growing up in an environment that lacks food, love, and education, but there are.
We perceive the family care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe accommodation, caring caregivers, sound education and reliable healthcare.
Family care is supposed to cover the needs of the children, who were not covered in the house where they had previously been.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The other distinct features of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of addressing usage types and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continuous relationships” were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in interpreting microexpressions, facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can observe whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his “President’s Speech,” showed how people who can’t understand speech due to brain damage still manage to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such skills of interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination cause each generation to dominate the direction of variation by one or the other of the two gene pools.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to satisfy its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so attracts serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources were proteins from leaves and legumes, but they are hard to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of protein that contain all the essential amino acids.
“Given all this, it shouldn’t surprise us if our ancestors solved the ‘protein problem’ in a similar way to chimpanzees in today’s savannas.”
Sleep interruption is the procedure by which you wake up intentionally during your normal sleep period to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a conscious state without fully waking up.
If you happen to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bedtime, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one’s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is its own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, to which were added the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga fasts, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process and culture led to the separation of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to last forty years and will be fought seriously, by “delegated” armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans, however, became useless almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers were set in motion to create the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one side of the oceans to another.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country’s ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy’s ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples in this regard was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would be unlikely to occupy Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
The goats appear to have been tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to home for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing places, usually in the care of herds that were often children or adolescents, similar to well-known today.
Roads of the wagonway type have been built in England since the 16th century.
Although these cars consisted only of wooden planks arranged in parallel, they allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could do on the slightly more irregular roads of the time.
Crossings were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually concluded that the rails would be more effective if they had a metal strip on top.
This has become a widespread practice, but iron has led to faster wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transport was walking; people began to walk upright 2 million years ago, with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning the righteous man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in 4.2-3.9 million-year-old Australopithecus fossils, although Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to somewhat reduce future suffering.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological progress, and the problems are greater now due to overpopulation and humanity’s extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten paper, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press, a few blocks away.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 children were made, known as the ‘Dunlap poster.’
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 remaining Dunlap posters are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don’t think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds you can still see many characteristics similar to dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of two values, 0 or 1, and the name of these numbers is binary or bit, in computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication for an internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions on that particular poison.
The term "peanut" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from the ancient resemblance to moths, which are insects very adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer and hedgehog cockroaches are nests, adapted to the life in the nest or the home of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which means it is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is neither in their own interest nor that of the child.
These couples can choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one however, experimentation and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers mainly used classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas on all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West awoke separately from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not mere responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase’s experiment represented one of the most important evidences in favor of the DNA hypothesis being genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments labeling either the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline-like cells can be passed on to children, while mutations from anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
The tourism organized around the exploration of nature attracts people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example would be visiting, photographing and learning more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small settlements in the country to their jobs, passing by others whose job destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone has some connection to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has dislocated the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has sustained human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or the collapse of bridges are rarely encountered in developed countries.
Why do transport systems give rise to such dissatisfaction, why do they fail day by day? Is it because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something worse happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, conduct tends to remain within reasonable limits of constants; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and partners for mating much more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that can’t fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeris.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; namely that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don’t feel the Earth moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, having a width of six miles.
No less than 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans from the planet’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It accumulates water from thousands of smaller waters.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical craftsmanship of construction.
Ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used every day by most of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known since ancient times some fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they can be found in nature in the native state and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, issued a theory according to which everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air and fire.
Rather, he recalled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he theorized that it was transformed into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually a combination of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys can also include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing media emerged, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to get their hands on a sharpener.
You can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something new comes up.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a core with seven protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up the hill. Breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with little or no momentum.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called bark.
The bark is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker in areas of higher relief.
There may be more sea in the near part, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying elements that attract people’s attention or delight them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with development to maturity.
These theories study what causes some people to want to do what they do and what in their environment can cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Theory of Needs Pyramid and Herzberg's Theory of Two Factors.
Generally, two types of behavior can occur when managers start leading ex-colleagues. One extreme is trying to stay “one of the boys” (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, in carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and empowering people.
On the other side of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals who think they have to change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to ruptures between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members gives the report. The invisible team sets the standards for each of the members.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When in the functional departments of an organization all available resources are used effectively, creativity and ingenuity can manifest freely.
As a result, the process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to get organizations to achieve higher performance.
The data in neurobiology are physical evidence that underlies a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. As such, it allows the narrowing of the area of research and its definition with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes that are taking place in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and adapting intelligence to machines.
AI research involves manufacturing machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, but a few software applications for personal computers and video games have also been used.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. Students can watch museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while in the classroom.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also an excellent way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the site is remodeled, and previous versions are maintained online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve the student’s written expression. While students often begin their blogging experience with negligent grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
“Also, blogging ‘forces students to be more aware of the world around them.’ The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).”
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their study far beyond their regular school day.
Proper use of blogs “can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of those written by others, as well as shape their own perspectives on certain issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital, offering a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka District and more.
These and many more highlight Ontario as being representative of what foreigners consider Canadian par excellence.
Large northern portions are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison among the populations that have the gift of surprising everyone: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is higher than the entire population of Canada.
The eastern islands of Africa lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true continent in its own right when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which had great success in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the maritime route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's good to wear a wedding ring, but don't look expensive.
Women should keep in mind that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, hand-held, etc.
Be decisive when you refuse a man and don’t be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, it still doesn’t mean it’s OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans and Mariners, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to him by Spanish merchants who had established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old medina is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and lots of all kinds of minces, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the settlement streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, for visits outside the city it takes an information effort to understand at what stage are the battles that are still being waged in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trips in Africa.
For travel through Goma you can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price of a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Besides its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used metaphorically in the sense of exotic, remote places."
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the danger posed by sand.
It was one of the main breaks during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special show, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in sharp contrast to the rest of the country’s cities because it has a more Arab flair than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the national parks of this country (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It could also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry into either a number of South African parks or all of South Africa’s national parks.
The name of the Hong Kong territory is given by the island of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists regard as the central point.
The exhibition of buildings that contribute to Hong Kong’s horizon has been likened to a bright bar chart that is highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbour’s waters.
For the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the developed urban part of Hong Kong Island is cramped on land recovered along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British colonists have acquired, and therefore, for those looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is on the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they also comprise some of the last remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/marsh.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has become a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengali tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (over the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar / Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses connecting the districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Splitting a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 No) or Punakha (200 No).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It stretches on the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two bands of 3.50 meters wide.
The free height of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for circulation until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
Guaraní were the most important indigenous population living in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region also hosted other indigenous tribes such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, harvesting and fishing.
"Paraguay, formerly called the 'Gigantic Province of the Indies', came into existence in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors met their indigenous groups."
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous identity and specificity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo games, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is set to be equivalent to 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley and in front of the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although they will likely receive British and American currency; contact the owners early to find out what means of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the country, so you need to exchange them before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures frequently reach over 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below the freezing point, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
“There are no particularly ‘rainy’ or ‘dry’ seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.”
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, respectively 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile it may seem, the buffalo, moose, bear, and almost every other large animal can attack humans.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept the right distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so it is good to give them their space.
In addition, be careful that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be advisable to avoid strong-smelling foods and keep clean at the campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval confrontation of sad remembrance in 1889, when many ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland lies between two ports. The most famous of these are in three areas.
North Shore beaches, located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where you can swim safely, and most have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a wide range of shops arranged along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
Many French wines can be found, but those from New Zealand or Australia would do better.
Local tap water is drinkable, but if you have fears you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of “flat white” coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is “espresso”, cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. Fruit juices are peppered as a price, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay more attention to safety warnings.
The box meduza is found near the beaches and near the estuaries of the rivers from October to April to the north of 1770.
Sharks exist, but rarely attack man. Most sharks scare people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
Any changes or requests must be addressed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp out on site, and most of the participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to arrive early to catch a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages is over, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, since sailing through the ice produces unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
St. Petersburg cruises also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the requirement to obtain a visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent here by customers and the money spent by them. There are usually no windows and clocks, and exits can be found hard.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep the good mood and guests to stay in the local.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages from the house. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and good players know how important it is to stay lucid.
Those who will lead to high latitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On frozen and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive like dry asphalt.
During the snowflake, within a very short period, enough snow may fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or viscolithic snow or condensation, or the formation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa’s main tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to the voyages on land undertaken to see the astonishing wildlife of Africa, especially those in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow good visualization of them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will be able to see them better using a binoculars.
“A safari on foot (also called ‘a walk through the bushes’, ‘drumming safaris’, or ‘walking’) consists of trekking, either for a few hours or for a few days.”
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations on the territory of Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you have booked your air tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, coronavirus cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that the majority of tickets to the events will cost between 2500 and 130,000 pounds, with regular tickets costing around 7000 pounds.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that you can borrow, even if they do not exist in the room.
If you don’t have an iron at your disposal or don’t like wearing iron stockings, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one at hand.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause contraction or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters differ from each other in efficiency level, and if you’re worried, consider buying water in closed bottles from a company with a good reputation.
Travellers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with at home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritation, or, in severe cases, can cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a man using physical force are generally not considered harmful.
Duty-free shopping offers you in certain places the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers who are going to visit high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The portions between Point Marion and Fairmont present the most difficult traffic conditions on the entire Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often crossing through isolated and unintended areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose control: steep slopes, narrow strips and dangerous curves predominate.
The speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is all the more important that they be strictly adhered to.
However, rather bizarrely, the mobile phone service is much more powerful here than along many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of the southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, apples being used throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, woodpeckers and other nuts. Often, popular cakes go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries, taste what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a food based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
“A curry can be ‘dried’ or ‘liquid’ depending on the amount of liquid.”
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without any other qualifications, however, the term tends to indicate food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a series of flavored dishes with simplicity, the predominant flavors preferred by Javanese people being peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavored spices.
The stairs support the rider’s feet, hanging on either side of the door.
They give the rider better stability, but can pose safety concerns, as it is possible for a rider’s legs to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from the saddle, but remains with a leg hanging from the ladder, the horse can drag it along when it takes it to the hunt. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then some of the saddles, especially the English doors, have safety bars that allow the ladder belts to break away from the saddle if they are pulled back by a rider who falls from the saddle.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's most sought-after place for mountaineering, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and high granite cliffs.
The hills offer stunning views from their peak. Mountaineers from all parts of the world continuously draw new routes between the walls with unlimited potential.
Snow-drop sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down the snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the legs.
“Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called ‘ski booms’ in English, who organize their entire holiday around skiing in a certain place.”
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have cave paintings that represent skiers since before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpack hiking on skis: This activity is also called skiing in unmarked areas, lap skiing or hiking on skis.
It is a related activity, but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering tournaments, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you’ll be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking – but very rarely you’ll be able to reach typical cross-country speeds without a heavy backpack on neat slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, going through several countries would mean going through visa and passport control procedures repeatedly.
In this sense, the Schengen area is organized as one country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without having to do so at passport checkpoints.
Likewise, those who have a Schengen visa do not have to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money and documents to obtain.
There is no universal definition to establish which items produced are antiquities. Some tax agencies consider antiquities to be goods older than 100 years.
The definition varies by geographic location, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced objects.
Reindeer farming is an important source of income among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many who have other trades.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, but lived by fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as burden animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi area.
"Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word 'gypsy' is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population."
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, it may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of other governments than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
An example would be how American citizens in the Middle East could face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is just a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
Opinions are often presented superficially, generally, and too simplified, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Extreme weather" is a generic term used for any type of dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause harm, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and are of many kinds, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Heavy winds, hail, heavy rainfall and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as storms, tornadoes, marine trumpets and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal climate phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be wary of the severe weather hazards surrounding the area as it could upset their travel plans.
It is recommended that anyone planning to travel to a country that can be considered a war zone should have professional training.
An internet search for “hostile environment course” will likely provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually take between 2-5 days and will include role playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes gun training.
There are plenty of books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo a sex change operation in another country must ensure that they have valid return travel documents.
Openness of governments to the possibility of issuing non-sex (X) passports or updated documents to match the desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies equally.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet performed the surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without affecting their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the backflow to the ocean from waves breaking off the beach, often to a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there can form a rapid current to the deep waters.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in trying to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the water, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to move into a position where you are not caught again, and depending on the skills you have and whether or not someone has seen you, you may want to wait to be saved.
The shock of returning home manifests itself faster than the cultural shock (it persists less from the euphoria of the honeymoon), it lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes encounter special difficulties in re-adapting to their native culture.
If you returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost yourself from the customs of your native culture.
When they had just gone abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that visiting a new country required a process of adaptation.
The world doesn’t always expect patience and understanding to be necessary to return home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the whole area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually the noise made by tourists and sellers is always heard. The show of sound and lights seems to be detached from a book of stories.
The sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the south of the peninsula that is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsula Mountains unite to give birth to this plateau, then split again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains chain, split into two by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel chain, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising at 4,892 meters.
In isolated places, with no signal to the phone, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone in general cannot hold the place of a cell phone, because you have to be outside, with an unobstructed view to the satellite, to be able to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions that require remote transmission of data and voice.
Your local phone service provider may give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular alternative for people planning a break year is to combine travel with study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before pursuing a university without jeopardizing their educational journey.
In many cases, enrolling in one-year deferred courses abroad may even increase your chances of accessing higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programs.
“Finland is a great place for canoeing. ‘The land of a thousand lakes’ also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.”
In archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national recreational activity of Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is from 1 to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore on trips aboard a ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009)
As you can see on the map above, Berlin is by no means close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: it’s no different from personal fears and dislikes than other things that are manifested to many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is essential in terms of documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies owned their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and clear.
The only way to make it pass faster was to be sent as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and here you intervene.
The obvious way to fly to first class or business is to pay a large pile of money for this privilege (or, better yet, to convince your company to do it for you).
But it’s not cheap: in general, you can expect business class to pay up to four times the normal economic rate, and first class up to eleven times more!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts for business class or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, in which context they charge fares according to the requirements.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from an inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and its own currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Christian Orthodoxy.
Szmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second port after Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed and modern shopping center, located around an enormous bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with glass facade buildings and modern shopping centers, feature traditional 18th-century red tile roofs as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
Haldarsvík village offers views of nearby Eysturoy Island and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the church yard, there are interesting marble sculptures of the doves above some tombs.
It’s worth spending half an hour strolling through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which has become beyond the country’s borders following an enthusiastic passage of its splendor by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north you can visit the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a place known throughout the world for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that in principle you are visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still these men and many women who survived the internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jewish and others.
You are asked to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by drawing and scratching existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and practically all Spanish.
However, most of the panels are made only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport, along with other services.
Regular metro announcements are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known as self-centered, unpolitical, and arrogant.
“Although it’s often just an out-of-the-box stereotype, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it’s good to behave as best as someone who’s ‘well-bred’ (well-bred). It will help you cope much more easily.”
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a minimum of politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, mollusc and trees and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and altitude levels.
The region is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare wildlife such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, laughter, wild cat and mountain rooster can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women should wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer covers for unprepared women, but if you bring yours, especially one in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or the mother at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after every use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any spices available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even within the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or an adjective being used in a substantiveized form.
Pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to which you need to be more careful are c and g, because their pronunciation varies according to the vowel after them.
Also be careful to pronounce differently r and rr: caro means dear, while caro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Obviously, those who know a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may conclude prematurely that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn’t need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated today and remain open as museums or educational venues.
Since in their glory days light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas that have favorable weather conditions.
The look of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the baby flowers were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the Emperor for himself and other members of the Imperial Court aristocracy.
Plants look nowhere better than in their natural environment, so don’t let yourself be tempted to harvest even “only one” of them.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting “specimens” will also lead to your expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can easily orient yourself and buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
“But being in the ‘upper tropics,’ just a few degrees north of the equator, you’ll have to face both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when it’s clear, less often).”
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, where according to tradition the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were buried, along with their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland navigable waters can be a good theme for arranging a holiday.
For example, visit castles on the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important celebrations of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions related to this holiday have been adopted both by unbelievers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the night of Easter awake, outdoors, to see the sunrise.
For this tradition there are of course explanations in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditionalist churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening on Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, the result being that the giant turtle is the main animal that grazes in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit areas of the Arctic or Antarctica in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not, so often a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars as well.
The Japanese culture of work has a stronger hierarchical and more formal character than that with which Westerners are accustomed.
Costumes are the standard clothing in the business environment, and co-workers address each other using their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is an essential element, with a focus on group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often need to get approval from their superiors for all the decisions they make and expect them to follow without question the instructions of their superiors.
