The CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
CSSD's new elected officials at the city hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the city council level with their old and new SDG colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to the CSSD, namely if they know the rigor that was born in the last years at the town hall, when they were the partners of the current coalition that ruled in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream set in motion during Mayor Pavel Bem's previous era describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it has been discovered that the newly elected officials do not quite understand the known terms.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm a fast in Prague politics," said Lukas Kaucky, the culture-chosen "godfather" vocabulary tester.
And with regard to the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
“That’s the only expression you’re using.”
Otherwise, I don't use sarcasm.
From the vocabulary of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-ectoral congress of the ODS, the editorial team chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry shop", "beef nerf", "betrayal of the capital" and "entholing".
Three of the elected officials agreed to the quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future- first promised an interview but then failed to pick up the phone.
The fifth-chosen Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test.
“I don’t deal with these things at all and how the representatives of citizen democracy are having fun: I won’t give my opinion.”
"I'm currently dealing with how we're going to understand each other in our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not seemingly recognize in the above legend, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
“This is the Blanka tunnel,” Kaucky says and immediately adds, “But I know it from the newspapers.”
“I’m going to have to pay for a language course,” he joked.
Not only matador Karel Brezina, but also Lukas Plachy, the environmentalist, know that the golf hole is the Blanko Tunnel.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the sense of "going to the pastry".
“It’s, I think, going to a company,” Plachy is ready to guess that this is the headquarters of Janousek’s companies.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to test candidates, there is no lexicon of pride in social democracy.
“I’ve taken advice with colleagues and it turns out we don’t really have something like that.”
“You say names sometimes you use abbreviations and symbols,” said Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which members of the party call Hulda.
“I was called Briza at school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” says Karel Brezina.
The daily newspaper Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly old man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted attention to him before the elections by scams during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little yoke".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats admit to using within the party.
It appears that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor of batting law" it seems that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of Doctor of Law JUDr. at the police academy of Bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of “witches,” a pamphlet has been published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The woman who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
“Man very rarely has this destiny.”
"Young, healthy women are not judged either because they participate in work and give birth to children," says a sister who works in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a booklet that should help limit witch hunts.
The case has a "hic."
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” warned the daily Die Standard about the drawback of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso’s neighbor Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had sprayed on her.
It was the BBC server who transmitted this information.
Criminals say it was the evil eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointing became inflamed on contact with the woman.
The oil flared, it seems, when the team wanted to "hunt the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: “Human mind-eaters have always been a danger,” he says.
As Burkina Faso struggles to reduce witch hunts, Gambia has even seen the President himself participate in it last year.
“The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that he said was involved in his death and that they were trying the black magic to kill the President as well.”
“Close shamans from Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal guard of the President, men and women chosen at random from villages in the Gambia,” the organization said in a message.
On the farm, people in prison had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
On the international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
Bakal's tenant: The poles are warming, he has signed a higher rent.
An elderly man came out the door of the RPG Byty customer center of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and that of his son who is serving a sentence.
The deregulation increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3,500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
“And there’s no hot water and the heating runs on solid fuel,” points to the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed anyway," he said, angry and half resigned.
The citizen association of BytyOKD.cz apartments that described the new rental conditions as “immoral and indecent”, advises renters not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to follow to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a hand gesture.
“One says this, the other says something else” by frowning.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic expect, whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesdays at 9 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don’t have time to read your “157” number as your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to find out about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems as everywhere - claims for repairs, events concerning insurance and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with new leases in their mailboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases from 15 percent to 38 percent.
The special window for new rents has been open to the public since November 18.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," says the employee, after a moment of hesitation, behind the counter when the client shows up as a journalist.
Bakal deregulation and old miner apartments are a very sensitive local topic.
The vice-president of parliament and from the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region of the Social Democrats reported this fairly strongly before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
“Twenty years after them, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change a put...n of board in the toilets," said the man mentioned in the introduction.
However, these are mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to make sure they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as promised by RPG in a special offer.
This is a discount of half the amount of rent that will be received by the other tenants who will have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by questions.
“Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent,” the employee said at the counter.
And yet RPG puts individual rent interviews on its website as well as in the windows when it is needed.
If the two sides do not agree on the rent, an independent court will make the decision.
“It’s not about threats, it’s just about informing you about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” RPG said on its website.
“No one will go to court here,” thinks one of Byty’s RPG employees and the man in the street in front of the customer center is right.
“I have 13,000 retirement crowns and I have 5000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic in early 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, current rents are still not reaching the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the rent increase.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in 4 billion apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this is expected to make 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs of the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
“The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments.”
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech kronor per m2 per month," the screen says.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
“In these cases, it is an increase of a really very low sum of 19.66 Czech kronor per m2,” adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of the offices understood by the architects.
Brno’s Avriopoint administrative building is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The architectural project company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has imagined its mini business kindergarten since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, mostly of childbearing age, and it was important to her that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
At the same time as reduced time contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine work with care for children.
The employees of Arch.Design.themselves imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini kindergarten is financed through the European Social Fund through the Czech Republic’s Human Resources Operational Programme and State Budget.
They were able to purchase equipment and appliances and after two years to provide qualified staff and start-up.
After the use of the funding (two years) the company Arch. Design. is obliged after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to apply for staffing.
The care of the children is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and kindergarten teacher take care of the children. children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are over threeyearsfor most.
As this is a "mini kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more that are replaced.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it involves individual care and education, the curriculum of the mini kindergarten is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children do not only play there but quality teaching is also ensured - from the beginning to the preparation at the school benches English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of a delay to pick up the children from a school far from the parents’ workplace.
Parents use their work time in the most productive way.
It is no wonder that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudi's interiors.
The toss looks like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is how the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi is.
Due to its organic shapes, the house has received from the locals the nickname House in Bone.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is epic for Antoni Gaudi’s Art Nouveau.
The front facade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In the course of a more detailed observation we see geometry, rhythm and order thought with precision.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brilliance of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measurement.
Wood copies in waves the window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, the eyelet and the slats.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction was carried out for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, initially insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-housing house was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that the decorations for a representative apartment of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
For the facade have also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for Casa Battlo began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the house hot right after it was finished because of its organic forms "the House in bone".
Others, with regard to the specific mechanism of opening the windows have called it "the house that swings".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the building contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with typical vents and fireplaces.
Their 45-degree tilt seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not respect the construction guidelines of the time and did not allow himself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the permit to build, knowing, of course, that the data carried on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the city council was horrified and asked for changes.
For example, the members of the municipal council did not like that the pillars of construction should be pushed onto the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city's call Josep Battlo asked (and got satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were canceled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the living rooms and the high society can communicate comfortably or else limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has received besides new facades a non-traditional toteura and two more floors.
Gaudi’s play with the light is also impressive, with blue and white glazed tiles decorated with the inner courtyard and with the light wells.
The two-color game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was inscribed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the tours as they found it to be a lucrative undertaking and they expanded the scope of the tours to the common areas and attic including the roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and holders of tourist cards have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entrance price to Gaudi’s other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a basement: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for sleeping, so the mattress and the baseboard give a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they have to complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the choice several things are decisive,:the weight, size, age, health status as well as the gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and baseboard will be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a country house where you do not continuously sleep latex mattresses are not suitable because they "warm up" gently.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture, mold can also form there.
Habit is also crucial in choice.
Whoever spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses with a softening layer are frequently used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
“That’s how all the hockey players who come back from the NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
“For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam.”
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people suffering from diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system that therefore poorly assume "information" of the joints and skin," says Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered hockey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico for example have suitable mattresses.
You don't have to be an NHL guy to be able to appreciate a lazy foam.
This “miracle” just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t turn around at night like after a difficult game.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against squats.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, that is about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of 180cm size therefore need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It is convenient in case of a visit.
'However, there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly folded. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own baseboard and mattress, so be careful however during the ashtray to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the basement to different heights and this is not possible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of this count for the layer of shape and ventilation at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of baseboard.
The bunk bed, when the mattress and the bunk bed are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are very bad; you should not wash it, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this reason, the specialists refuse to make a claim for a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But it's all his but.
And for this a advice of experience from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And although nowadays it is common to manufacture zippered coatings for the whole, that is to say that after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the handling for large models (and for only one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a .
Do you have in your bed a rigid board instead of a basement?
Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are any) with aeration holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with pocket springs (Germany Taschenfederken) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position lamella mattresses with 14/18 lamellas, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more lamellas, 28 and above, where the lamellas are folded in the lower part so that the bottom is stiffened.
For mattresses with multiple positions it is not necessary to take a spring mattress because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the slats, one can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special bonding of the slats that makes it possible to press or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper "fits" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as the back", it's really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for the "male" have begun to use a softening area at the shoulders.
But they also think about women - they offer them a softer surface at the hips again.
For the most difficult customer there are winged or wafered frames with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and dinnues the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (big and inflated air) on good mattresses and baseboards, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow should support the head and its tips should reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians per example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle of the basement or the padded area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also with the organic mattress.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
“The organic designation for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender scents.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of birch plants so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract speeds up blood circulation and is therefore warmer for weak sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay for a quality mattress from 7000 kronor and above.
Those that are characterized by their parameters for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached the top spot.
Saving for the mattress and baseboard is not easy.
From time to time, two mattresses may be available for the price of one mattress for special actions by manufacturers or producers.
As for example the company Magniflex that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic mosses with an open cell structure and a great thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" pace.
This began as matter for NASA because astronauts were experiencing huge load factors at the start.
The Tempur softens in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is therefore ideal against bad sleep and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers use for example EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child causes more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can just as well be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases as for example that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved many people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit there may be instances of misuse of such devices, like putting it in the bag of someone who isn't aware of it, but I haven't met such cases yet."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know for what purpose "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child does not want to carry something of this type on him, he will get rid of it.
"And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to deliberately getting rid of something when they don't want to be under control."
“Mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations,” says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is highly questionable.
“If it is a prepared abduction, the author will do everything so that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it.”
“Currently, it’s the phone.”
"As soon as the tracking equipment develops, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
“In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police,” the psychologist says.
She admits, however, that such devices can help in an unprepared assault by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The device can be set up in such a way that it is on regular transmission after a certain period of time."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
“The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and finds himself lying down without moving,” says Cech.
According to him, so-called smart phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with special software.
The problem with current tracking systems is that they are either similar to those worn on pendants the size of a matchbox or on smaller telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll realize it after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracking cars.
This is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many strings that it could go around the Czech Republic with it, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of cords used for the explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence bought 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating cords from the STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff has given as a reason for the acquittal of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to reserve calculations made by army pyrotechnicians, contacted by MF DNES, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or cleaning personnel should have an explosives drill every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, a maximum of 2 m of detonating cords is enough, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has secured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that firing sessions are limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of body linen, we don't talk about it.
“And I don’t get my head if they buy such a large amount of detonating cords from us.”
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"For us the military is a good customer that we as traders strive to please," says STV Group Commercial Director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of kilometers of detonating cords have been acquired by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reports, however, that the life span of the detonating cords and the pyrotechnicians of the police and the army is only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can go up to four years," says one who does not want his name published in light of the army's criticism.
By the time life has passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the soldier’s life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the amount for 445 km of detonating cords.
“They cost us 60 percent less than last year’s 245-kilometer supply,” said Pejsek, an interpreter for the defense ministry’s buyers.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords of police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This was established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and also to be able to obtain more flexible types of more modern and reliable detonating cords.
Today the Ministry of Defense has major problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading on the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "inexpensively".
So far, I’ve been taking advantage of the contacts I’ve gotten through the contests.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun for the place of winner of the contest of the best Individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of last year’s Best Individual Entrepreneur contest was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia there was a lack of a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
Of his savings on what he had earned when working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a third-year graduate student, it was a courageous move.
“The ratio of quality to price of an accommodation in our area made me want to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building that he transformed into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open 4 guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels in Liberia with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, he got another one of the same quality.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise have come forward,” the No. 1 of last year’s contractors.
"And for the sale of the license for the commissioning of a large-scale hotel the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition has served well," Pytloun adds with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People would recognize me in the streets, congratulate me often and, I have to say, it was very enjoyable,” he recalls.
He recommends participation in this contest to anyone who is trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he is using his contacts and knowledge to this day that he could not have obtained in any other way.
"With those I met through the contest I started to have regular business relationships.
According to him, the reputation related to success also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
“I see in them above all the loyalty and pride of having committed to something that has been generally recognized.”
“It’s not by far the only result of my personal work, but the result of good work from all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” Lucas Pytloun said modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to Farmet winner’s sense of purpose, he has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to Slovansky dum for the first place of the contest for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million kronor.
“I can say that the award has not only encouraged me but also my employees and increased our self-confidence to fight the competition,” said the winner of last year’s competition.
At the beginning of Farmet’s history there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not long after they began to specialize in presses for vegetable oil.
After 18 years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialist public after the success achieved in the contest through the media.
“Not only did our customers really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who began to realize that they were collaborating with a company that achieved the greatest success in its home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not pass to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic results of 2008 and in part on 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their pursuit of new materials and technologies.
"Obviously we have not escaped this situation."
“The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off,” says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and retained beneficial results even if they were inferior to what they had before the crisis.
At Farmet, however, they continued to invest uncompromisingly in research and development.
"We have built with the endowments a training and research center, strengthened the company's presentation in international trade shows and won the main awards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky says.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
Affaires numbers go up and with them the number of employees as well.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes senseless regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could have been abolished.
The unglorious winner of this year's Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the Social Affairs Administration requested a paper extract from the trade register while the official can get it in two mouse clicks.
It changes with the investigation.
“The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the trade register for insurance payment controls,” said Jana Buranova, a spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Bringing out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must comply with in the Czech Republic and removing those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the absurdity of the year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters showed up, it was at least 4,000 this year who brought their voices.
And it's no wonder, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only do curb the company, and, this, more and more.
“We may be among the number of documents to fill out for tax returns to the top spots in the world,” says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a goal proclaimed by all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of conditions for the company, 8 places more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first held in 2006 and continues each year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report every year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the closing of the contest.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the most votes is declared the winner.
Until last year's last investigation, there were a hundred, or more accurately 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and professors.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees is, for example, the obligation that motorway and expressway maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the contest, which always begins at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the highlight of the competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts stalls in the legs of entrepreneurs and for that my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business,” Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade, said in a statement.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a shot in the water.
In 2007, what people didn't like was the obligation of contractors to declare three days in advance at the office for the individual company at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to report a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee to the Labour Office, was removed with the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything is fine until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training or sporting projects are evaluated.
This year’s Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already been running for 5 years, is the category called the Firm Responsible of the Year 2010.
The objective of this contest is to support the business reasonable and fair.
“We want to support companies that monitor their company’s environmental impacts and conduct socially responsible business,” said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of the contest, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the 2010 firm competition, organized by Vodaphone, companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term goal for the company have registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be edited.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, it is possible to consider their support and forecasting activity as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is the pragmatic prologics company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund sponsoring children with disabilities for 17 years.
The old paper mill in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of its employees, was awarded the title of the firm responsible for the Central Bohemia region and placed third in the region in the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, that has earned for having introduced loose working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and this, without, proportionally, a decrease in salary.
The jury also awarded her the title because she prioritizes purchasing from Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyenne activity in the vicinity and is concerned about the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,” said Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
the company responsible for IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages their work from home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation which helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
In the last place is, also for its activities, a company of washing and cleaning of the region of Karlovy Vary, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the bruntal construction company Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year contest, who had completed the attached questionnaires in the registration document and returned them to the organizer before August 15, were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category.
Improperly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the contest of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "main" Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition."
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Lands Fund in Plzen, police made arrests in a public contest
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed the local contractor and real estate trader Lubos.
The latter had tried precisely to handle a public call for tenders for the settlement of an application for restitution in such a way that the proposed ground was obtained by a determined candidate.
The latter was to pay Lubos G. half a million kronor.
"At the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in a public tender and competition," Plzen prosecutor Antonie Zelena told the newspaper, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations as the investigation is ongoing.
The police released the 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate with regard to so little official information.
In a question from Pravo, the spokeswoman for the Lubomira Cerna Lands Fund said that the police actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public contest.
“It was a client and in no case an employee,” she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Land Act" and is set up when several eligible candidates appear.
“These individuals are proposing, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to restitutions that must be settled before the value of the land is announced.”
“According to the proposed rights, a classification of the buyers is put in place and the Lands Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights,” the Fund’s spokesperson said.
It is clear that Lubos G. had information about the persons who had registered for the appeal and, since he himself is also a beneficiary because he had purchased a large number of restitution rights, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he probably cashed in by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
He was in the case of former FdT chief Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for editing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been edited.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the access road to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked putting the construction in jeopardy by a blockade of the land.
Households will pay an extra 100 kronor monthly for housing.
Households will have to pay a surcharge from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also rise.
Starting in January, families will have to draw up to a hundred crowns a month more than they do now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some locations you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be close to 100 kronor per year for households in apartments.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the sensitive development of encouraging the manufacture of renewable energies, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
One can also count a hundred crowns more.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the larger municipalities that are planning the price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay almost 50 more kronor per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberia will pay more than 1000 kronor annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing a 9 percent increase for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the pragues will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are up 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices will rise significantly in the 450,000 apartments rented from January, that is, at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase it by up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new rent increase will be brought to court by the company.
Regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could rise by 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk on rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This results from the experience of physicians who encounter cases similar to admissions from children's departments of hospitals.
“Beer or wine is no longer fashionable because it takes time to get drunk.”
“The trend is really for strong alcohols,” says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children’s department at the Horovice hospital in central Bohemia.
“When they manage to chip a bottle of daddy in the cupboard, it’s sometimes wisky but it’s the fernet and the vodka that prevail.”
“Wodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not smell it,” explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, a spokeswoman for the Motol hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"It's now the fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to department head Pelikan, seeing drunk children between the ages of thirteen and fourteen in hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he worked for ten years in paediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide surroundings completely drunk.
A girl was hospitalized like this four times.
“She started her career at twelve when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood, plus a mix with ecstasy,” the doctor said.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
“What’s interesting is that it didn’t seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours,” the department’s director said in a statement.
It is precisely the parents' disinterestedness or their extraordinary tolerance for the fact that their offspring indulge in drinking that are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to specialists, however, there is no talk of addiction, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the word alcoholic we mean a chronic dependence on alcohol of several years with all the phenomena that arise from it but that is not found in children."
"In those who use acool repeatedly, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," said Pelikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are integrated into the statistics.
Drunk children who are after emergency care taken home by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pélikan, he excites three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of the witches, Christmas Eve and the end of the school year.
“Either they drink out of spite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the start of the holiday.”
“Of course I experienced on Witch Day an admission of seven drunk children at once,” Pelikan said.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the next day from the "mushroom".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they have a great evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
“They’re just amazed at where they are,” adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils patients’ good moods at least with the bill to pay for their care.
Ambulance transportation and intensive care bed hospitalization can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
“From time to time, I’ve applied this as a means of education by telling these kids how much their drunkenness has cost and that they could spend all summer in seasonal work to repay a single evening,” Pelikan added.
However, in his view, health insurance companies in their regressive management, which are expected to recover care-related expenses from parents, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain.
Two of the five L-159s in total, against which the Ministry of Defense exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is headquartered.
This is the first time that such devices have become the property of anyone other than the Czech Army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were previously in service in the Czech Army and were in flight condition.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seater versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defense’s press department, the physical departure of Vodochody’s planes is currently unknown.
“The single-seater L-159s scheduled for exchange were taken from long-stored aircraft without causing additional burdens or investments for the Ministry of Defense.”
"The L-159 T1 two-seaters have been exchanged in the state," Pejsek told Pravo.
He said the army would not run out of two seats as the ministry signed an agreement with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 worth 200 million kronor for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two bi-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introducing the aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
“It is clearly stated in the contract that the one that takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used for training pilots from NATO member countries.”
"It is therefore the business of the one who takes into account how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defense did not tender and contacted EADS directly.
Defence management argued that the exchange ensures future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 aircraft from Aéro Vodochody and only used 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen as part of a tender at European level and under no circumstances by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
An index longer than the ring finger is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the index longer than the ring finger are at a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men before age 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining it with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health ancestors, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had their right hand index shorter than the ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the same length of fingers, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the ring-shaped, however, the risk fell to 33 percent, for men before age 60, the risk decrease reached 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that helps the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of the study but does not seem to think that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, clearers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometers towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 highway in Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the news
In the 91st kilometer a truck was crashed, in the 93rd two heavy trucks crashed, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also found themselves in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 th kilometer towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should exit just after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and then enter at the 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several kilometers was formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, there are rows of cars in Prosek, Sterboholska street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams are delayed on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff must meet again.
The railways and the airport also have problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 fast links because of the snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. in the night until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rolling but with increased vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there begins to be snow gusts in places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain communication routes in the places placed higher.
The Vyskov region was one of the hardest hit places.
So far the axes are closed: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them it may be necessary to send snowshoes and snowflakes.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will be rollable.
On the road to Hodonin caution is needed in the White Carpathian region.
On roads that are, with regard to nature protection, maintained only by spraying inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow, CTK warns.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snowfall in the Czech Republic gradually disappeared.
Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and “will change the game” for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super accurate cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25mm calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly-breaking explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
So you can use it against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when a deadly rain of steel shards falls on it, it can also put it out of action.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise point of view, according to which he corrects his target site and presses on the expansion.
"Let's say you targeted at 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the gun loads and shoots at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located in the office building at Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant specialized in the manufacture and maintenance of computers said on Wednesday, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far in the Marienbader square of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together 100 other jobs that have been scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the open-air offices of Astro Park are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just renting out.
CEO Bernd Wagner said: “Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure.”
He claims that the connection to the airport is precisely of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The relocation of a major company inside the region yesterday brought the winners joy and disappointed the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the Frankfurt municipality, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a “global actor” had been conquered.
It is an “extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation.”
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important momentum for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
Management soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer facing the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Town Hall Square building, used until now by Fujitsu and the nearby "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings in Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial spa resort construction project.
The result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the Town Hall, which aroused many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that used to be used in part of parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment rating and advisory company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer still associated with Siemens at the time, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German-based Frankfurter Immobilien-Chancen group bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu together with the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group sees itself as the world’s third largest provider of IT products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch office in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has far more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its plan in the shape of a star, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the electronic and electrotechnical industry.
Amazon eviction of the server - Threats against Mr. Assange
WikiLeaks is getting more and more difficult.
The Internet service provider Amazon has ejected from its servers the site specialized in revealing confidential documents.
This attitude may hide the political pressures experienced after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder Mr. Assange is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, WikiLeaks is under increasing attack.
The cyber activist group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely staying in Britain, according to news reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
“Freedom of expression in the land of freedom,” the cyber activists behind the revelations said on Twitter on Wednesday.
Earlier, the cyber company, Amazon, had deleted WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists used Amazon’s Web Service (AWS) to reach the highest number of accesses to documents.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks continues its revelations: “Formidable, our dollars are now being spent on caring for people in Europe.”
When freedom of expression poses a problem at Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Mr. Liebermann’s office, reported that Amazon banned WikiLeaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman’s collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper The Guardian reported.
"I wish Amazon would have taken this step sooner with respect to previous WikiLeaks releases of classified information," the senator said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, monstrously, and unscrupulously, putting our national security at risk and endangering lives around the world," the senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks to disseminate the contents of the stolen documents.”
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
The 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently labeled Sweden’s lawsuits as intrigues orchestrated by his critics.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been made against the site.
"Even calls have been made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of WikiLeaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was obviously responding to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee demanded that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s adviser told television, evidently ironically, that Assange should be “killed” and that Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
US President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange demanded Secretary of State Hilary Clinton’s resignation if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently leaked, to engage in espionage activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual website owner,” Gibbs says.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government now completely switches the protection of its databases to the test bench.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed responsible for fighting the leaks.
Travers is tasked with putting in place “necessary structural reforms” made indispensable after WikiLeaks released diplomatic cables.
The White House also wants to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the US government has announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by the WikiLeaks revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are prepared to protect them if necessary.”
The University of Ice
At the "University Gelato" of Bologna, ice cream confectors are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat outdated ice confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice making art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated showcase using a spatula, places it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice can’t avoid “Gelato-University” by the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sorbet maker founded the University of Ice in 2003 so that the ice creams coming out of its machines meet all the high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice cream are also offered over several days, and practical sessions are held in the private ice cream parlor.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk fulfilling their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, there were 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of arts education from California, is passionate about the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product to the country of Industrial Ice in the future.
Anke de Berlin is a business management consultant and she wants, after a few years, to draw something unique from this nerve-wrenching job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian maid came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice creams.
Determinant is not only the good flavor, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherry on the cake of the national and, in general, southern superstructure: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a faucet installed on the machine: a pasteurized white cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream, comes out.
The trainer is immediately beset with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
Those who only talk about ice creams "made from natural ingredients" have perhaps nevertheless used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it needs to be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will not chew anything but ice pellets.
Some changes in the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with aromas.
The master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the fruit or confectionery store of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
“The suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored ingredients.”
"However, you should just try."
Be in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when added cocoa powder, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now all participants in the course need to switch to using ice machines.
From time to time Luciano invites them to make four types of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experiment.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily have the taste of nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Very popular kiwi ice cream is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced blend properly enhances the taste of an ice cream,” says Luciano.
Ice making is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (wine growers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easy to calculate.
Icemaking no longer requires as much physical intervention as it once did.
It is not only the automatic base mass manufacturing machine that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it smooth and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbed himself of fruit puree from head to toe and thus splashed his fellow students when control of the colossal mixing bowl escaped him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "such an incident is likely to occur in each course: it's only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that is experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has topped the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now being formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve got it right,” Testbiotech Director Christoph Then told Munich on Wednesday.
Some reports indicate that the chairman of the EFSA Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobbying group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in developing EFSA's test requirements for genetically modified plants and is, therefore, clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to Mr. Then's criticisms.
The provisions elaborated correspond, by paragraphs, to the position taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities based in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period.
Not long ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union control authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, EFSA does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, is used as long as it is of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from contacting this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Kuiper admits that he works for the U.S.-based International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI).
This body sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts from, among others, the sciences, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being on the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know, for example, what the impacts of genetically modified maize are causing in the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow for reliable results.
"If we don't look for risks, how can we find them?" asks Mr. Then in an accusatory tone.
This is also the view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are hardly any researchers who are not related to societies.
In the opinion of the companies, critical studies would not be published.
Hilbeck says “industry controls safety research.”
The Trace of Stone
Uli Gsell has procured about 400 kilos in total.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a manifesto.
It was snowing.
The story is known: By September, excavators had come and begun to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people protested against the S21 project, transforming Stuttgart Central Station into a multi-billion dollar underground station.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the stoppage of construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and earthy."
He claimed that by cutting it to the saw, he smelled the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he's going to do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tübingen, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were broken or if they disappear in the dump,” he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was the subject of insults and threats when newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the opponents of Project S21.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently won one of the stone parallelepipeds weighing an average of 80 kilos, whose value is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while also hoping to be able to give it back during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still crammed into the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could get into the trunk and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass beds.
“By the way, this stone is nothing special,” says Mr. Rongen.
"It wasn't that political component."
He gets into his all-terrain car, goes around his vast 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and later began studying biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a career.
And a lover of stones.
It stocks 40,000 tons.
He accumulates treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's refrigerating.
Artfully carved sandstones are laid on the snow.
"They used to be part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he enthusiastically affirms.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a pile of fingers: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Pretty travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the prefecture of police, the reddish granite from the cathedral Saint Blasien, the tuft from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were once carved by hand and moved with simple hoists and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
“It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be pieced together.”
He did not become rich, much less wealthy.
But this career now employs 14 people, and stone carvers, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener settled in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent Struggle to Conquer High Potentials
The counter has a large crowd.
16 students scramble to buy rolls of salmon, tomato sauce and whites.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a sort of idea contest, they have to talk business about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, get to know the Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go melee in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in amphitheaters before they reach the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities don’t publish statements about their students’ performance, we try to spot and retain outstanding talent in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group loves talents.
A young staff lady shares pens, candy and cards with Volkswagen’s logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs to young talents; she shows them the paths to access the group premises.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
“As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as collaborators.”
According to Mr. saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students to.
“In the past, the focus was more on the professional project,” says Selle.
The struggle to win new graduates will become much tougher.
In goods of the sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by performing a sorting on a number of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and above all court the highly skilled workforce.
These are mainly graduates from engineering fields who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI's forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will increase even further.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt for KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the U.S. in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG’s subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The one who has to participate in it decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are becoming increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the count seems to be there.
“Until today, we have remained in touch with all the people who took part in such an action last year.”
“Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon,” he says.
Apart from on-campus direct customs, small and medium-sized businesses are doing quite classically by participating in trade fairs where they engage in brain hunts.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
“For example, at the Solar Technology Show,” says Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, a manufacturer of solar panels.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are available on the company's website.
“At the moment, it’s very difficult to fill vacancies.”
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says.
Another way to make contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to undertake professional internships or write their final draft of study with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are being announced by solar specialists.
That’s why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized ambiance, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
“Often a large group can’t do that,” says Staff Chief Ms. Stübe.
For a long time, money has no longer played the main role in the search for employment.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, he asks employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of the employees.
The Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the image of the company among job seekers.
“I think candidates rely mostly on external assessments regarding a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through their own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, that is, the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best messengers."
When they treat their employees well and identify with the company, they advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the southeastern state of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government issued a ban on an equivalent ban and thus definitively reversed its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is still prohibited.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the drilling rig "Deepwater Horizon" that is responsible for this strict ban, which should remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with the accident that claimed the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries when it comes to the supply of oil.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in golf has not, to date, been definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing multi-billion dollar claims, is at the center of the charges.
An investigation commission set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the freezing of the drilling decree after the platform exploded.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tougher security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing extensive reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would remove the lucrative tax niches of oil and gas groups.
Players in this sector of activity now publicly warn that the supply flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
“The government’s goal is to curb the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector,” according to the result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, ahead of the drilling ban pronounced on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what exactly will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water that flows in the rivers is oiled brown; it gives off a smell similar to that that exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live by theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
“Don’t get exhausted,” the environmental activist told reporters to calm them: “You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man plunged into muddy water up to his chest, as well as the greasy trail around him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the rainbow-coloured glitter of water.
You can't see that the basement is full of brown sheets of crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom says that she once collected shrimp in whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely cooled.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil sprang from a pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen in the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the devastation jumps to the eye when walking through the mangrove swamps crossed by streams of water.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat breaks a cradle brown water. Whoever dips his hand removes it all covered with oil.
The roots of the small mangrove emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. The isolated palms sadly leave their palms hanging.
Clouds of birds are searched for in vain, as they are usually found in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence descends on this paradise of yesteryear that looks like a gas station because of the smell it gives off.
“What is happening here is a war against the environment,” says Celestine Akpobari sadly: “Our lives are characterized by permanent health danger.”
The comparison of wars is made.
The area where the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous.
Even today, the return to Ogoni country is prohibited to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 well drilling and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines in the entire Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of Ogoni country are untapped, because the situation is too unstable for this group.
All the few hundred meters stand in the water of steel trestles like strange sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most are rodents by corrosion to the landmark.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks apart from time to time, as a steady stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts’ estimates, more than two billion liters have spilled onto the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that flowed into the sea during the crash of the supertanker “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For Shell, sabotage and siphoning of oil pipelines account for more than 90 percent of pollution, while environmentalists see drillhead explosions and drilled oil pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell Group of applying essentially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failure is "even far higher than alleles."
Some forms emerge from the mangroves at a place that, seen from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of blackcurrants and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with blackcurrants up to the neck.
A fire sparkles under one of the many barrels that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motive on the site must be spotted: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
First, the gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the pipe drops of kerosene fall and eventually diesel is obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: "This earns us 34,000 Naira", about 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low of just 40 cents per liter of Diesel: Because they buy their raw material free of charge.
It is being offered by the “protectors” who are drilling the pipeline network across the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil in this way throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a tiny fraction of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military members, charge the lion’s share in tanks and brag it off to the global market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and the foundations of fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be neither sabotage nor illegal theft and refineries.”
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni’s relations with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was only about the withdrawal of the group. “Perhaps the operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will turn out to be better.”
Then Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to get out of the way,” announces the sturdy oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to enjoy the raw material like all Nigerians.
"In every way, this damn thing has brought our country down very low," Akpori said.
Investigators discover construction flaws in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major safety problem.
Examining a device that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction flaw that can lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, passengers on the Airbus owned company Quantas had evidently been more fortunate so far: In the course of the investigation it conducted, the Australian aviation safety authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and it warns of a possible construction failure.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks at the connection of the oil pipe, according to a statement released Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a “catastrophic failure of the reactors”.
The reactors manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft of the A380 series are concerned.
The company's Airbus Quantas, which had to land urgently on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now filed a lawsuit against the British reactor manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas director Alan Joyce said his company would seek damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts broke apart and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the oil inflammation that is causing the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, the airline Quantas had grounded its entire fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-story aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the country causes chaos in transportation
All-white Germany: In one night, snow fell on almost the entire country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany crawl: By freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered in snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they were unable to overcome the snow that kept accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves to occur off the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels as high as 1.2 m above normal.
Snow heaps on highways and on federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That’s why the bad weather alert center Meteomedia announced the violet alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, this is the highest level.
In some places there was 30 centimetres of fresh snow that the strong and cool winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have reported serious road disruptions.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic disruption and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutsche Bahn, severe disruptions to rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thüringen and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees fell on railway tracks, catenaries or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, interregional transport between Leipzig and Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the train’s 165 passengers with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfall has resulted in numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesman said 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no more passengers stuck at the airport, despite the fact that only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car crawled on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists are announcing good news: The snow will always be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank is looking to break away from its emblem: According to news reports, the financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring in up to 500 million Euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group’s headquarters: The twin towers located in the business district have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly looking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the Financial Times Deutschland writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we're checking whether it's more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or sell them, and put them back on lease later."
This is how Germany’s largest financial institution has already given up its seat, shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of 272 million euros from the owners of capital, and then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at optimizing energy have swallowed, according to some indications, about 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, in the meantime renamed "Green Towers", at about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for the buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the safety situation at the disaster well continued to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue teams were able to descend the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and administration had considered that the miners had no chance of surviving.
So far, the bodies could not be recovered.
Today, family and friends held a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth, south of the island of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, we installed 29 tables on which we could see the names, helmets and lamps.
Photos and personal belongings, including clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags have been blurred in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative party that New Zealand has nurtured hope that the miners will surface.
“But they never came home.”
Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said he cannot resign himself to accepting the death of his son until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
South African and British miners were also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand’s South Island.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre with his film, "Walhalla Rising", the epic of the fighter.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal killing methods.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind man does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let out, at most, in the corner of a sentence or two some terrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and feasted in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that was the setting for the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal for more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travelling.
When a film targets multiple target groups, it is a shame that these groups are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy about the ferocious and stylish drug trafficker, as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the art and essay cinema.
Most art-cinema sympathizers must feel horror at the brain spreading all around and the intestines.
Action movie lovers die of boredom, when the blind man embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity in calm and fog before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent.
No wonder that Walhalla Rising did not find any film distributors in Germany and only exists as a DVD.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of misery that has merited some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It’s not dialogue in this film, it’s not coherent action, it’s all ambiance, it’s a feverish dream turned into a movie.
The spectator cannot escape it.
Refn grants him hardly a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who faithfully stands by the blind, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at all times to fight enemies and temporarily allies by transforming himself into a warrior, is perhaps the devil's envoy himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, only for those who are, anyway, rotten.
Walhalla Rising is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, whose purpose is annoyance, enthusiasm and amazement.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the euphrates; the largest nearby city is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in the IAEA documents, because it refers to the reactor that Syria apparently built with the help of North Korea in parallelepiped stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a U.S. intelligence briefing, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring locality, el-Kibar, would be well-suited to produce plutonium, which would make it possible to manufacture atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring fuzzy satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the inside of it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is scarcely more information available than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery grows thicker and thicker.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but had little clue that the country was developing an “active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a “presumed reactor,” even though they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “plausible.”
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he ensures he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking U.N. diplomat gave a laconic response in the summer by saying that the IAEA had “sufficient documents to ask questions.”
The Syrians certainly hastily removed the rubble of the “unused military building” and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the terrain.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in el-Kibar traces of man-made uranium.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from one member state showing the moment directly following the attack; it appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particles, calling it implausible.
Since that time, Damascus has refused to discuss this, as well as satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection at the el-Kibar site and denies access to the wreckage of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
This is how the investigation into this case has been dragging on since June 2008 without a result and has "become more and more a serious problem of the credibility of the Agency", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat serving at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, in the end it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities they are dealing with, or what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also by the names of neighboring cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has identified these locations and found satellite images of a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspect objects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria denies access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that caught the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have been shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve for fuel production."
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are indispensable for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to the unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible hypotheses regarding the following fundamental questions: where should the uranium have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would later have been separated.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide high-value traces, was stored at all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with dirt are gone, no one will have information about where the rubble is stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for storing radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing satellite photos taken on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos show, however, that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to those sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help rule out suspicions.
It said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA had spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out there, which would allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows the great interest of the inspectors in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be signalled for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been talking about what is known as special inspections for a few months, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means carries a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, like that diplomat who gives to reflect: "Would it be useful if in the end they found nothing"
Love in a Time of War
It’s been going badly since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a Bosnian woman and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women’s federations immediately protested, and in response, some planned filming sequences in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at the last minute.
In the meantime, the film was shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continued in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress, Jolie herself being UNHCR's goodwill ambassador.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she offered these women a meeting in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie’s script says a lot about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commission that Angelina Jolie be removed as a goodwill ambassador.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted a filming authorization in Sarajevo after some hesitation, but it is not known why it did not come later despite this authorization.
The young author herself assures that she is not pursuing political objectives with her film, and that she has made a lot of effort to learn about the Yugoslav conflict, and that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all stakeholders the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This, however, is a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with her executioner".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on erroneous information.”
Now only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: By illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's shoot!
Everything is going well with the Irish again.
There is no trace of consternation.
This is why the local team dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States excessively.
Fans shout with joy against the background of loud music, they tremble with their feet.
Baileyu-Pub from Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups from the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong". The winner pockets 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to go to Las Vegas in January at the world championship of beer-pong.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors don’t really go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his plans. In January, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling,” he says.
"The country is so far away and I don't have a job there."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the bleak prospects in the country, two of Tanner’s three sisters have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanning.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research say 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even forecast a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts come true, it will be an emigration trend comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now takes over.
However, the economic crisis mainly affects well-trained young Irish people, who have so far experienced only moments of happiness.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone has a job, there is too much money.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times abundantly publishes the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is going awry."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity is leaving and our country is going to be a generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future because the government is only throwing powder in the eye and offers no future prospects to young people.
“They’re reducing minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old student says.
She sees how her comrades cling from one unpaid internship to another.
She says that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
“It’s a sad and depressing thought.”
However men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" fair which offers comprehensive support on the theme "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for those new to the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the official.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gall, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing more to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hanover or Berlin.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, so he can complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in the country.
“The situation is already a little crazy,” he said, crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
“I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I practically don’t live anymore.”
He bursts with an embarrassed laugh as he crosses the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-maintained front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O’Donovan bought the house jointly with his sister for 380,000 Euros, funded by the credit.
“These were moments of madness, no doubt, money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, sips hot tea and says, "I don't have any children to maintain and I'm young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations he often hears lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island," he said.
“Working abroad for a while isn’t the worst thing that can happen, maybe it’s what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
“He was back after seven years and in Ireland, life was just going on.”
I like this idea of Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life is happening elsewhere.
In his career, he already has a few years of work in London, which is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there's one more thing he's been worried about these last few days: the party to be held on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He fears that it may not turn into a farewell evening.
“Only not a lot of emotions,” he says while drinking a long sip of beer.
"A goodbye, it still seems worrying."
"Let's call it a relaxed farewell evening, bringing together a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it monitors changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey results, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy recovered after suffering a sharp decline in output last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, lowering the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country’s parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply from 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
While this has been going well during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a social safety net has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year to 32 percent.)
But moods vary considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say they or a loved one have been a victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this view (and 80% support private enterprise); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private enterprises.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country in awe.
Ballot boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballots scattered in the gutters, polling stations looted and intimidation
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Hatians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, roamed the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, have denounced the fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior United Nations official in Haiti, sees the event as “a fairly good election in many ways.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they "did not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, the outgoing unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no perceptible support among the voters, is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the second bulla reaches the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an important step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And so, of course, Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
Weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning that into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Fernández’s obviously grieving choice whether or not she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, was accustomed to developing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Fernández’s government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has plunged into disarray following Kirchner’s death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement rallied with Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian slapped one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress doesn’t have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even more room to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage demands see this figure as close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which carried out forgeries of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18 percent.
The economy has been spurred by high world prices of Argentina’s agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore financial relations between Argentina and the rest of the world.
This year, the government entered into an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not paid its due dates in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández sees to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owns some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF oversight, as is customary.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide “technical assistance” to design a new national consumer price index; which looks like a prelude to the clean-up of INDEC.
It is unclear whether Ms. Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among whom Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have receded.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to reject, without noise, many of her husband’s policies.
Half a hour for China
Taiwanese voters are oriented towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters ran on November 27, 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment by the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for sentiments toward the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. My passed the test, but just.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, it failed to win the majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned toward Taiwan’s full independence, won nearly 50% of all KMT votes by 45%.
If it were a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has fallen by about 8 percent.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the key topics of the Taiwanese election, including busy campaign trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal clothing.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt was also perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Link, purely through his face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to note how the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and detests China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stoking anti-Chinese sentiment.
It is the answer to a new realization that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It is to be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the fold.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let’s start at the beginning.
Better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has, however, reinvented itself.
Two years ago, he was doing badly: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on corruption charges.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates was born under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is doing everything it can to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, like Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presents a “trustworthy alternative” to Mr. Ma’s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will find it difficult to choose among its potential candidates.
The KMT must make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's ratings were low; despite dizzying economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said his cabinet and local offices would be refurbished.
The PDP’s good results suggest Taiwan’s support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent columnist, “the point of no return has already passed.”
Grammy Award nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "best new artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to read about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a major nomination in the “best new artist” category.
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album Esperanza, the nomination remains a bit mysterious but is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given its slightly engaging vocal style, skillful pop and funk category and Latin influences, it's possible to draw at least one dotted line in Spalding compared to Norah Jones' blazing success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Award winners in these years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Awards voters have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History" in the "instrumental album" category, a rejuvenating twist on a recording that was one of last year's top favorites.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will compete in particular.
Shorty, a New Orleans hoarse voice favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also strongly leans toward a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Savage Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, has won some well-deserved recognition in the grand ensemble category; competing with Billy Childs Ensemble's rich chamber-jazz and eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose "Pathways" album of his live byte was a fine example of this bassist's democratic hand as a leader.
Grammy Award nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
Classic nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes from musicians and composers from around the world.
Leading the nominations are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman’s Madolin Concerto is also running for a prize.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, operatic, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and Daugherty's "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals concluding the Orchestra.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra; "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Far" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shœrchemer's National Orchestra and du
Composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition count Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatmente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he soon wrote the 15-minute work especially for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
“I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms from North Africa,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominees; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixes, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project is approved by the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics attacked the project, claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday evening that the new religious center respected local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
“Many people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha’is, you mention him,” Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of that, as an American citizen."
“It shows that justice wins.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
“They just have very loud voices.”
“We have good people in this valley.”
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the center, at the time roughly equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“There is no more America,” one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced the violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of about 135 families has co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32-hectare site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral high school.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been deemed essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That’s why it’s very particular, even though it’s far from being a truly ‘foreign’ form of life,” commented Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report featured in Thursday’s online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers have found that the bacterium, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"One wonders what's still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important when it comes to finding life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The finding “shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to actuate biochemistry, and that the “standard” set of elements, which we deem absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed,” said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute for Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," said Cockell.
It was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances might be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms have a hard time distinguishing these elements separately."
“But arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and, in a way, gums the work of our biochemical machine,” Anbar said.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth’s existence, she says; thus, researchers hypothesized that early life forms might have used it.
This suggests there could be other ways of forming life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibit dogs have been found in Compton.
The other two show dogs out of four stolen from a Bellflower motel were found, Los Angeles County Sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs - two akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late on Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore says.
“They are in good shape.”
“They were returned to their rightful owners.”
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, and under what circumstances they were found.
“An investigation is underway.”
“We don’t mean it,” Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide comment on Thursday.
They met Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national "AKC/Eukanuba" championship in Long Beach, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly month-long dog show tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is unclear whether a prize was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially lauded the “pre-packed” plan by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be wiped out; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and television shows.
With Thursday’s decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no legal hurdles remain before MGM to get back afloat under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will be a lighter studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million credit facility to fund MGM’s new operations and productions.
It is currently being licensed by the investment bank, which is itself colliding with $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it could not afford to pay interest of $300 million a year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the extra $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be reworked as the MGM team had begun working on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreement and internal debate, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially goes out of business in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already earned $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have raised $355,000 a month for their company’s management services, will receive a $4 million “success premium.”
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch production on MGM, which released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on “The Hobbit,” with Warner Bros.
The studio must enter into a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18 percent of MGM’s debt, has attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
While the top contender for this year’s most wonderful toy is the iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant gap in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jumping ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It’s clear that Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known of their kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one makes it possible to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: once you start pressing, you can’t stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Drawing inspiration from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based games like Simon Says and can do the lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
The children who have spied on the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with quiz playing cards designed to turn a ride into a car into a session with a self-correction and a valve book.
If you’re suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
The Mobigo from VTech ($60, for ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for ages 3 to 12), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-style system to deliver games and e-books and features an SD card input that displays family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and over) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Penguin Club pet online, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for ages 6-12) that includes a coin marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the latest button-battery micro-robot.
The fake beast moves quickly over 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to do a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to maintaining order in China
Tang Shenbin surveyed a city square as an urban sergeant at training by severely inspecting his nerve loads, issuing low orders with a military authority.
He wanted chengguan’s female members – imposing law enforcement officials in China, fearful and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence – to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Stand up!"
"Be prickly!"
Show them, he said, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely spent their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-coloured jackets and pants, were freezing in your closet.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the ruler.
Four perfectly groomed hats perched on top of hair tied by a striped knot in blue and white.
“Personally, I think they look average,” Tang said, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city required that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong has exchanged the gray-green uniforms for a purportedly more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced eye-dropping with the strong way: In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had circled an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur repackaged his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to do a major imaging operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street policing of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, gavage and young age.
The idea is to give the rude police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have difficulty getting a look at China’s underground urban brigade.
And for good reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media is portraying the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his cell phone to film them dispersing a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and posted online, described how to effectively defeat offenders without bloodshed.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon colporteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game imbued with violence, available as an online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
"Chengguan has marked the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after yet another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a “true complete cleansing.”
Skeptics say the approach is far from that.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if the women had real tasks or if they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s announcement required female candidates, aged between 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and “five facial features in the right order.”
They must have a height above average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is mandatory.
Officers said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
“It’s their image that’s important,” a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they are suitable; it's about size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and “inner qualities.”
Chengguan women are like flowering vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city's district management office, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement relating to the order of facial features.
That this means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Disabled or disfigured people do not have to apply.
“We can’t let a lame person or a hump come to serve here,” Zheng said.
“It wouldn’t give a good image.”
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has her cheeks tanned with a finely curved mouth.
She doesn’t consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
“Do you think I look sexy in that uniform?” she asked disillusionedly.
Xu Yang, her 21-year-old dimpled colleague, says, “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They are not opposed to their mandate being limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team takes on a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many rolls or bowls of tofu as possible before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
“We’ve told you so many times already!” said Ms. Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning her noodle cart bike.
Officers describe their duties as monotonous rather than arduous.
“It’s pretty much the same thing every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies after-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers’ assets.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were knocked over or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from placid Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the policemen, with their sinister faces, paved their way to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men’s team, stayed behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 and over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxy image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case involving an assistant in a former campaign and his efforts to get lobbying work for the woman's husband, the senator's attorneys announced Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Mr. Ensign’s office said he was “very happy” with the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “notified that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case.”
The Department of Justice abstained from commenting on this matter.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails, and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator’s affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been an employee of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole for a year by law.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to contradict the so-called door-to-door ban on lobbying.
Based on the evidence that has been made public, “there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the revolving door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the department’s judge declined to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level cashbacks by its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to drop prosecutions of former Senator Steven Te’s wrongdoing.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the director general of citizens’ responsibility and ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s senior lawyer, said in an interview that he had received a phone call Monday from a Justice Department prosecutor and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign’s team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, had “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins declined to specify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was “hammering” the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transportation Secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue her hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call points to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing far into the rows of the courtroom.
They were sending out every minute reports of horrific testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the trial of the rape case and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted on by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines appeals that could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - has created a "circus atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could prompt appeals judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms is infringing on human rights at a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, attorney for Mr. Hayes, chief attorney.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, laconically rejected the claims in last week’s judgment, saying the media was “carefully controlled” and there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the issue.
Courts of appeal have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a lawsuit.
In a 1966 landmark ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his ruling that there was a “carnival atmosphere at trial” because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that appeal courts seized for reviewing a half-century later Mr. Hayes’ conviction may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage the media of the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There’s a general reason to worry about the impact of new media” in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue says some appeals judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is just one of many described by Mr. Hayes’ lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes was harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome pictures of criminal scenes during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a dispute against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was being discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media were constantly igniting the flames of the emotion of the case.
“The daily jolt of tweets from the media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “looked like nothing that had been seen before here, in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some reporters said the claim, that the snapshots were more incendiary than the slower releases, was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said the courts of appeal were often drawn to the arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes’ lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling that overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction because of the trial’s media coverage, and they clarified that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring the divides closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a warning sign of genuine bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders has produced no breakthrough on the major issues that need to be addressed during the "lazy duck" session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences of the two sides as well as acknowledging their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the committee on the president’s deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of mutual trial and test for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That’s why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent participants’ comments revealed a minimum of demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxation, spending, health care or fees, both parties stay miles away.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed on the tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
“It’s inevitable after the election.
The elections arouse partisan passions and then fade.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the “lazy duck” session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of it, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise on the extension of unemployment benefits is possible, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is surrounding a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "lazy duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "blade duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed widespread skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
“I consider most of what is happening between now and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing versus the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee that include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the toughest jobs in Washington and have, they say, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance persists among the elected members of the group; this suggests that there are few reasons or willingness to compromise on fiscal issues, at least today.
Galston plans two phases in the fighting between the White House and Congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the spirit behind the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the public’s reaction.
The one who will be judged in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would still be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Disclosed U.S. documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a “Kleptocracy” and passes to the Kremlin some of the bribes and protection money it collects, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by WikiLeaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was written while Yuri Lukhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has since been little trace of cleansing.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won several libel trials on these accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV channel when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s thrown away, it’s anything.”
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in an embassy briefing; and it is unusual to conceive that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it “dysfunctional” and claim that the government functioned more as a kleptocracy than a government.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term used in the criminal/mafia world that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor’s office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
“The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level.”
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
“This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report states that the FSB is embracing the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, “explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law.”
“That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer that high.”
The note notes that although the collection of money is extensive, the protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business close under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned the fight against corruption several times but has admitted that little progress has been made.
The embassy note conveys reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
“In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats,” said Georgi Satarov, director of Moscow’s think tank Indem.
“But it’s part of that bureaucracy.”
“It’s not part of a political class because it doesn’t exist in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption are estimated to be more than $300 billion per year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least the most corrupt).
The release of the U.S. Embassy note, which was made only yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will move with certainty the discontents within the Russian government; although Lukhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow’s failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed on CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks documents could be fabricated and reacted angryly to the comments that U.S. diplomats had leaked calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
“The problem is that this is our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect that it would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, as opposed to ethics.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor quality decrepit concrete walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School talked about the man who built it, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves your mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in northwest Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally called into question in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to publicly confront the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing, to 35 years in prison, the former head of Tuol Sleng’s infamous torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as “Duch.”
Faced with this evolution of the situation, anxiety has increased among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
“For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil.”
"The situation creates divisions within families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew Pol Pot’s U.S. government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrilla warfare from their base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have fallen into black poverty, common to rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers retained their local leadership positions in exchange for laying down their weapons, they were low-ranking, unqualified farmers.
“These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They are imbued with the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime.”
“They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is hard because we have to provide for our own needs.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also caused some trouble here.
The court is expected, early next year, to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to try senior officials and those responsible for the crimes, but it did not say whether it was pursuing beyond these four cases.
More would be needed to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers were reportedly killed.
Recently, on a scorching evening, Im Chaem was returning from work to the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” she said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also warned repeatedly that instability would occur if the court sued several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the documentation center.
“The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces,” he said.
“We need to put these pieces together so we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, consisting of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history textbooks, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old high school student in Anlong Veng, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
“They are suspicious because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, the manual and the courtroom are starting to make an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful appeal here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, overgrown with weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads up to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old roadside cell phone saleswoman, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot’s last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of military-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was leaked in a joint statement released after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations were carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter by about 500 pounds, according to one official who raised the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The deal appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, held at Obama’s initiative; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to procure an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“It proves to me that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the deal "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“It’s our product... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We’re going to use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, however, expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus’ research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization has been put in place to build trust," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a senior energy department official specializing in reducing the global threat.
According to estimates by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to phase out its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential revival.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
The government has not objected to CIA robberies.
The government has made no objection to the CIA’s flights with Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners into Guantanamo Bay through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents leaked by Wikileaks to the daily El País, which adds that the first vice president of the government at the time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercise adequate vigilance on foreign planes crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report accused a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights practices, a meeting was held between former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the Zapatero Government offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence theft over Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “taken by surprise,” Aguirre says in a cable.
Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the incumbent of the Foreign Ministry at the time, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited capacity to influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown concern for "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" more than for declassified information from CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a heated rhetoric".
The ambassador also expresses concern for the PP's action in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be construed as potential human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” she said.
Parricide that went to confession complained in network of the "overwhelmingly" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname she used from the time she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two were originally from Noia, the village of Coruña from which she originated.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tuñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get DNA tested.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a nearby municipality, was elected.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyllic has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008, she was alone in Menorca and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and angry at the fact that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed like a good thing to him, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then she's talking about a mobile message she just got: "I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains, “If he doesn’t like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I’ll take him when I get home.”
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to show up at a workstation so I don't lose it."
She explained that if everything went well, she would have taken her eldest with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother,” she said.
In July, there is another post.
When she hits it, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly murdered on the 10th, died.
“Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other.”
"On one side he's with me and this place he likes a little bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorca.
“He’ll be there for a few hours in the summer and I’ll save some money from the babysitter.”
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you'll come."
“Alberto says he sent you I don’t know what videos to the e-mail, you see, when he wants, he finds me, shit.”
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there’s one: “He’s giving me money.”
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now stuck, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Terror in the Galician (epigraph) ".
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything was over so she didn’t tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the Palma Provincial Penitentiary yesterday, from the Menorca Judicial Detainee Center.
Official lawyer Carlos Maceda explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "and she also did not intend to harm the minor."
She had previously confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and placing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People’s Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats
With the results of 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies registered in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this group gets in these elections normally doubles that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in the generals of 2008, while in the autonomous ones of 2006, they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC got 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, desired by a diversion of votes from the CSP and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, is maintained, the analysts of this formation have calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the CSP could increase from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also gain four (there are now 10 MPs or less) and PSC would lose 9 MPs.
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one member - there are three now - while ICV would keep one member or earn one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would be held in May 2011 for municipal elections, where the people can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populars agree that PSC could lose the city halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the socialists would no longer get the majority or the opportunity to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the mayor of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP registered only a difference of 500 votes from the PSC, of which the mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Populars have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven inmates in Barcelona, Thailand, there were three inmates.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Commissariat of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let's kill 106 people).
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" Al Qaeda's international counterfeiting apparatus has "been debilitated" and "hence its operational capability".
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that were part of the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its “combatants” could cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why in the investigations participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be in the following days similar blows to the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another one was held in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistanis Muhammad Kikani and Bukanyans.
They were the ones who ran the cell from Bangkok in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - was mainly stealing passports from tourists that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found connecting detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, a few thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were later used by the members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have documented extensively.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and that boils down to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity of his national desire.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to make themselves loved, because the CiU candidate requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the inauguration.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are done in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an inauguration "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereignist and independence speeches", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit to the referendum even.
The two leaders have their bets in common to weaken the political apparatus of a very exaggerated self-government and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the negotiation on Mas's inauguration will be dealt with by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The heads of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the harm caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the meantime that he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the center's lawyer, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to carry out the accusation against the person responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for failing to detect the night nurse's criminal activities in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he never stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - whom he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by phone.
The charity, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures may not have been at any time the cause of what happened".
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in this case there is only an indication of recklessness on the part of any other person than the accused.”
The person already baptized as "the Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused his death by injecting him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the staff of the center to medicines.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to relieve the pain of the inmates, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
The Charity does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet’s threat that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The differentials of the peripherals have closed by force and the shares of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely registered an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that, in the same way that it collapses, is recovering, but motivated by short and highly speculative position closures.
The institutional investor will soon lose his fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
Bundesbank demanded the finalization of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures “at least until March” and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond-purchasing programme will continue and even signal that it will be stepped up.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blindly to withdraw the liquidity measures, may God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed the markets, the story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the year-long auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only $500 million at 5.28% compared to $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole were published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even though Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumeable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval for its new budget and it still does not have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a focal point of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension ahead of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14 in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest is Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors like Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock exchange suffered 4.5%, double that of the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will be benefited by the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it will be resolved with a high demand and helps to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for a Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don’t need, the Treasury has more than $40,000 in liquidity available, triple that of March, at very high rates, and they cut off access to the sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar’s wife, “besides being, appearing.”
Courage, we can get out of it!
Eulen president will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict in the bosom of the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, because he considers it "null and void", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the firm holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the meeting of shareholders of January 18 this year whose contestation is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the thunder box within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the assembly.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal of the plaintiffs his five sons to try, through procedural arguing, clearly defrauding the Law and abusing the right, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18," according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for a challenge once the assembly is held, considering it to be "null and void by right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully to have the magistrate convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group nevertheless requests the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the challenge request for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with secret Siemens weapon
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the champion’s skill as a driver, German Sebastien Vette, or the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the “secret weapon” that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from the high motor racing.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines of manufacturing plants all over the world, power stations, high precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument at his Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute “in a few hours, almost in real time”, the modifications, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful IT equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull cars except for the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can move from virtual reality from the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limit to this technological development madness is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as the limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered “top secret”.
The staff for this task has 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull’s Formula One hero, no doubt, is recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety is zero.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, said five years ago it could be said that R&D progress in the case of race cars brought 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to Install 20 Clean Stores with Local Distributors in Two Years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the refurbished store located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to establish 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes all 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of exclusive store furniture (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of facility staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, support, after-sales and even packaging."
The store in Barcelona includes a space with a pioneering global pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP’s IT equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed specifically for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical support services," Helena Herrero said.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' one million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in the interest margins, which will be partially compensated by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, its task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011, the bank will launch a new master plan with a three-year validity.
The goal, apart from surviving without having to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain market share by capturing one million new private customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank - its great task to accomplish, because until now this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the private customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year’s Optima master plan, set four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more exercise.
Customers who let savings banks escape will be their main goal.
During a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a “difficult and transcendental” year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even though he thinks the war on liabilities – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and caisses pay for their issuances to obtain liquidity is already shifting to the price of credit to offset falling margins.
“The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a pressure on credit.”
“We didn’t tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see CincoDías on November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the banking sector’s trend now “is to increase commissions”, but “there is a competitive framework”.
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger dimensions will be requested."
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He says capital needs are "growing enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalisations.
Having assured that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that one cannot issue, but contrary to what happened in June, one can obtain short-term funding through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among coffers
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of savings fund mergers and reiterated the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the merger process of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
“I think most of the mergers have been made, we can’t say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, they are adjustments.”
"Most of it has been done completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been done under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," he said.
In the declarations during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is carried out "at the fastest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out in the timelines that have been set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain".
“The move from 45 coffers with an average asset volume of 28.500 million to 17 with 75.500 million is a process unmatched in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to be Basel compliant,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of all Europe and "probably" the world and he attributed to people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a process of concentration "very important" and "goes to the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has fared well from the stress tests that BCE carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin opted to remain in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolition of 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the South would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal rigour, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were boosting deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought needed to be done (fiscal stringency plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second blow from the Central European country was when Merkel hardly prolonged the decision to save Greece.
From that moment it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time force private lenders to bear a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the following months, we should be witnessing the Union's reform process that will make these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we must now take measures with which we may not agree too much, from then on the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will signify the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in cessation of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a portion of the costs.
Germany warns us that we must follow a strict growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It’s not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked to do is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater peace of mind.
And let's take the opportunity we've been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel’s criticisms, we have paved the way for the thesis to be put in order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don’t seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that we are considering, we cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary area that is too full of countries that are not serious.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she warned us.
Sport and Law Fraud
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
In principle, the expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match against Ajax in the Champions League on November 23 has caused a lot of ink on the anti-sports character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team was already clearly winning), both players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes in determining the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of his group, the two players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next match of the dam against Auxerre and will be able to move without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee sanctioned with two games the coach of the team, José Mourinho and different economic sums to the players involved.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not quite common in the football world.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that emerged in the case is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his hymn shows nobility and honor and who on past occasions has sentenced to a fine to his players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, who added one more episode of his history to his technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behavior is not expressly prohibited by the regulation and contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether with these actions one commits a fraud of the law; because, in fact, they are actions that are respectful with the sporting regulations, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been endangered, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with the correct game is to prevent the team of offending players from unfairly profiting from the opposing team, which is also not the case.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, as its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the referee.
They waited and willingly accepted the sanction.
Another question is the type of benefit that offenders obtain from the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put one at a disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same game either, because obviously the result of the action assumes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, climbing the ladder is not so clear as to be an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which still includes the making of strategic decisions that promote the maximum profit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), otherwise they chose instead the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without thwarting the penalty or running away from it.
Even though the boundary between genius and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think we've had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there have been two self-evictions and because of the way of transmitting the director to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bullfight and the lottery, when December arrives also the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive prices adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide the interview men of the sector.
To finish complicating accounting, this year’s calendar (as the night of Easter falls on Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing the week before.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying with their own pockets.
Whatever the circumstances, they all demand battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer’s representative, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
“People think a lot before they book.”
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices,” he said.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with a good service", he adds, and recalls that customers have a tendency to go down a step with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey of various establishments in the centre showed the collapse of applications for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras Group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim of spending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of November.
“We did the impossible to maintain the same prices of last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they said.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting a surge in billing since the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Group sources mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased somewhat.
On the part of the Fecasarm patronage (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "animated", even if customers "trade to the maximum".
That’s true, hope for the festivities hasn’t fallen, no matter who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises major concern in the United States
Islamabad is producing atomic weapons “at a faster rate than any other country.”
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program raises in Washington.
Apart from the illuminating and tasty details they offer about the content of the conversations and thoughts of US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, “decreases” and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson said in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is short and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev during a meeting with his US counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan's high degree of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", said: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistani Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
The Hunt for the WikiLeaks Leader
Obama will appoint a senior anti-terrorist official to avoid further infiltration.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Also, this one is not new, otherwise it is dated November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Mark Stephens, WikiLeaks’ founding attorney, said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
On the 20th, the international police force based in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving the authorization of the authorities of that country.
Interpol’s 188 countries have been instructed to identify or locate Assange “to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot give the arrest order for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice call a free way for the arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where it is thought to be.
The movement outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the founder of WikiLeaks, 39, was willing to respond by videoconference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
“This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
While the world searches for him – and in Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he doesn’t shut up.
On Monday he gave an interview to Time magazine’s editor via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they spy on the UN in violation of the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior anti-terrorist official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance."
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to reconsider his statements after saying that Assange should be "murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something like that."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"He who is in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with winks to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for solving yet another internal uprising inside ERC, with no north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as its liar and that it can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticism with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 ERC national advisers will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot, not by raising your hand.
If the Carodists want to convey a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand from the president little more than putting his position at the disposal of the militia, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
To do so, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the National Council vote on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which leaders consider a sure fact.
The ERC leader has admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization once and for all be able to wash its laundry room as a family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet has signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the incumbent of Innovation thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five, of which he highlights two.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new figures that come from the adept sector of Carod.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC once and for all the assembly as an operating mechanism.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by vote.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive 2008 conclave mandated management to revise the assembly model at a specific statute reform congress.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time might be right to pick it up and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut off in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the stroke of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, a subject's body was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan municipality.
Very early on Thursday morning, owners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the motorway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots when he was leaving his house to start the garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a gunshot to the head each in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, in the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the forehead we found the corpse of a man on a lonely path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet hit with a .25 caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
Emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán alerted about the discovery of a corpse that was in Peña Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to his neck.
Halfway through the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, two death warning messages were found at the same time with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony the rest of the body was wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan was found which had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executors had left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin were detected Santa Muerte tattoos and necklaces with her image.
Towards the end of the month, a corpse of a man in the municipality of Zinacantepec was found at the edge of a car with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads flushed and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens with those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next door; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The country’s COP16 representative said his country has made huge efforts to reduce the coal footprint and detailed that it is maintaining its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China is maintaining its offer to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, in the last four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and pilot programme support.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives addressed in terms of reducing greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emissions reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned, the Energy Efficiency Program, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for changing filament lamps with cost-effective lamps, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government’s scientific advisor on climate change, said China’s efforts were greater than previously thought.
For example, he said, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar one by 2020, he said.
Espino's legal expulsion: César Nava
The National Leader of PAN detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to apply to the National Order Commission to demand what is rightful.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is rightful.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, Espino's expulsion is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on December 4 and 5, when a successor should be elected.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal,” he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary "we savour it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the board will no doubt be able to elect the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the succession "to the person determined by the board."
“I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five.”
He predicted that the party’s stimulus in the July 4 elections will be reflected on the upcoming dispute, although “it is not yet time to think about 2012.”
"At the moment it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made many hopes regarding them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations.
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four-year rule, César Nava asked the PRIs to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; let them start defending them; let them come out of ‘the closet,’” he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, let alone censorship.
Obama promotes law on Twitter for undocumented students
“If you agree with the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama met today at the national rally to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree with the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message maintains a cybernetic link to a broader document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
“With a vote we hope to soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,” he said.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continued.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax issue is resolved, an agenda can be set for the rest of the bills.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
“We all agree that this tax issue needs to be resolved before the end of the year.”
“I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a “closing vote” on the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on as early as Thursday in the Senate, even though the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they have stayed in this country for the last five years and they have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the help of a large number of Republicans, at times when the pro-project organizations are heavily lobbying to ensure the passage of the bill.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term on Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his stance so far.
Even though the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put the finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasure of the Language was a walk in which the participants showcased the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what do you expect from me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures de la langue, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in embarrassment", gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to find out what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually opened, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concludes: "on the wound I was only able to know that it is the one that is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and traps of the language must be closely linked to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a beautiful narrative he titled Praise for Invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at one point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous enchantress who touched clouds, turned people who had gone far away or repaired the virtues that a young lady had lost, a narrative that she turns to speak then America, the great news that from the beginning had its own columnists and quotes to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the narrations.
Cervantes, who invented us all, mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in such a way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked modesty.
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "the fools and the liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, it is no longer known what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
“It’s because of his legacy that we are what we tell.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the FIL's invitation with her roundtable Le due sur la wounde.
The Cuban-Portuguese woman has her own set on the great scourge of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about trafficking and the sale of drugs.
“I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated,” she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a “chemical reaction” of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
“To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we have to nuance: and nuance means a lot of times laying a finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in black and white,” he said.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach the deciding series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that face off, marked by their technicians, who find a marked contrast between them by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series, even if so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine ended up comforting himself with the medal of under-champion, he stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The saintly strategist arrived in his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with whom he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again as his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got a 3-1 lead with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed out on the 11-meter or he suffered the 3rd result.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistic, it's for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," he said when asked about his weaknesses in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the end, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to race before the party, I think it's a party.
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular deadline, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately destiny has done us a bad trick, sometimes it's the emotions or the title we have to enter
Romano now has the opportunity to stop being an under-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to present themselves at the Visa Applicant Service Centers (VSAs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages for applicants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visas will not be required to appear for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest ASC where they will present the documents and be fingerprinted.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants seeking a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants to the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The US space agency has quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will release an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” which has sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments thought uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will release the true scope of the findings at tomorrow’s press conference on Thursday.
The conference will feature geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest satellite), with the view that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia et Patrón 'bloc' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled in Congress when an opposition bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo appeared, which declared itself independent and the four were questioning one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'toned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, bipartisanship is initiated because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board chaired by Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they do not have it, they will again be enslaved by both parties and in this way will end the opposition coalition.
“So far [the opposition coalition] has arrived, that’s what I’m looking at, because we’re excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now “duopolitical”.
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartisanship in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now the Congress has turned into a ‘butin’ between the two, referring to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it in two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the member, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
“That they don’t leave by cupular agreements out to five who will probably be nine MPs, now to the five we are seen, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have done, that they have decided, we are out and we do not agree with this reform-there.”
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The City of Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With it, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of suppliers accounts".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“We didn’t buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the State Official Gazette, the Act provides that when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Northwest had published a revision of the cheques that the City Council issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be cared for
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán has asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be cared for and new activities must replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune you lose, elsewhere they don’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to take responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and just do the corrective," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because this is a tourist area must be maintained, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are overlooked and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
“They’ve only been given the attention they need and this kind of fact highlights something that’s notorious for everyone, maintenance is necessary.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, under secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that have to get in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, tidy and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Luckily Mazatlán offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that we should order first, clean up and put on line to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP requests results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
Mazatlán’s business sector is seeking a legislature of dignified and free work between the parties and the government executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and facing major problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislature was installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 MPs from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, a total of 40 people's representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
"We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to guard their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
“We will ensure that they do a dignified and above all committed work with society and the sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add strength in seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they are driving economic growth, generating incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way that will stimulate the generation of jobs.”
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that this is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that it directly rivals the agribusiness."
Apart from the fact that resources must be classified to detonating tourism projects that help to give security to the State and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We are looking for a magician king.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is made up of no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
“Sometimes it’s very difficult for us, because my husband doesn’t have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the ‘plebes’ to sell on the street,” says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, José Alfredo, 10, has long aspired to have a monster truck and for his little brother Jesús, 8 months, Cayetana suggests sized clothes for a year.
“He said to me (José Alfredo), ‘I’d like to have this monster,’ but I said to him, ‘we’ll see, my son,’ because he was very expensive,” Cayetana recalls sadly.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, is wearing size 12; Isaiah, 10, is wearing size 10, while Miguel, 8, is wearing size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair the size of five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign On Seeking Magic King, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 Alleged Drug Dealers Arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The search took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used to produce drugs.
“Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged heads of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were expected to appear at Sherbrooke’s courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for trafficking purposes, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches came as a result of a lengthy investigation, which lasted nearly a year.
"It is the information received from the public that allowed us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigative module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Régie de police Memphrémagog took part in this police operation.
Clandestine migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated as the three opposition parties said Wednesday they could not support it.
“I rely heavily on the Charter.”
“I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet,” Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to one year's detention of anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he was attacking the wrong target.
“We’re against it and it looks like all the opposition parties are against it, so we’ll see what the government does,” Duceppe said.
The NDP’s immigration critic Olivia Chow has rebuffed criticism that her party isn’t firm enough about illegal immigrants.
“New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that’s what we’re doing through another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservatives’ bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are telling MPs that they don’t tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a crawl.”
"They expect Canada to take strong action," said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led to elections in the event of its rejection.
A Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that each member who opposes would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
Public Safety Minister Robert Dutil argues that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation on this matter as early as January.
The city has had a permanent corruption unit since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was not enough for the Pequista critic of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as “a rabbit out of a hat” and a “do-it-yourself solution on the corner of a table”.
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he said.
“We are aware of that problem.”
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, there is no substitute for a public inquiry.
“The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the École nationale d'administration publique.
To get out of this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
“We need to be able to expand the auditor general’s mandate,” he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would come from the Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments related to this case.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit groups of motorcyclists, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangster Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall in several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another slip occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rain fell in several regions, from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday night, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
Since these precipitations must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in certain sectors, there is concern that several streams may overflow.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday evening by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, at Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood watch and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the overflow of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In St. Calixtus, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes has resulted in the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civilian Security remains on high alert and is monitoring the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Centre on Wednesday issued warnings of heavy floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback to the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as his crude on-air language.
The CCNR finds that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the comments contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and the crude language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day."
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of Socially Assisted Persons of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
The facilitators must present solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, the host Stéphane Dupont considered that suicide is a gesture of cowardice.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life’s problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes called into question 'Doubt the noon' have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame was held on him.
The latest litigation dealt with statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media face-to-face that had aroused a lot of reactions.
The host of CHOI said that he had made no donations to help Haitians because it could not be known for sure that the people in need would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes unduly negative representation of Haitians.
“I’ve already purged my three-day suspension on this.”
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of high listening within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and boxing Thai climbs on the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to develop with professionals.
“In my case, I’m looking for fights pretty much everywhere, since for those who don’t like mixed martial arts on the ground, competitions are rare in North America.”
Recently, the security guard and UPS clerk has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won the categories of full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he explained.
“Currently, I am preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup.”
"The fighters who finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I came third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've progressed in every competition."
“At this rate, I’ll be first this time or next year!”
"San Shu" or "Sanda" is a discipline native to China where punching and kicking, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
Duels take place originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned boxer of this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to remember only one event in his career, he will surely respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
“This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China,” said the friendly guy.
"It's kind of the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real pro,” he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the final of their category."
"The winners of each category then face off to crown one champion, the kung fu king."
450 million contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium made up of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor companies obtained the largest, that of the project management, for a sum of $295 million without a call for tenders.
This consortium called Énergie générance was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Management Consortium was awarded the lucrative contract without any public tenders.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of business consortiums poses a serious ethical problem that may eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
“This is the new way of colluding and breaking down the competition.”
"That is, people, instead of doing it secretly, are now doing it openly," Fisherman's deputy Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he says he hardly sees how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, denying vigorously that there was collusion for this contract.
“I’m starting to have my trip,” she said, arguing that the PQ had been “maligned” and had “lacked rigor.”
She said "it would be the least thing" for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is underway and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula for consortia in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the Quebec business register allows us to count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
Regarding the Energy management consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to particular workforce dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s".
The great boss of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that highlighted the fact that the project management contract was granted over-the-counter.
“If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher.”
“You have two choices: Either you take the people that are in that market and you say, ‘We’re going to negotiate a satisfactory deal and at a good price.'”
“But the idea is that it’s not the price that’s important, it’s people’s competence,” Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Énergie générance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has secured 22 contracts, Génivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in Energy management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard hinted that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau let go of the fact that the PQ is also linked to the firms that “finance” it, before clarifying that it was more about its leaders.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - "Green" Label Does Not Inspire Confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little trust in sustainable development actors, but also in fair brands and environmentally friendly certifications to guide their choices.
Pis, even though he is bathing in a media world where messages in favor of more responsible consumption are teeming, he deplores a lack of credible information, which he even calls a brake on his commitment, says the Responsible Consumption Barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of respondents say they don't believe in companies' environmental commitment and companies' green advertising, according to the measurement tool developed by Sherbrooke University's Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications based on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, the Barometer says.
In the same vein, the discourse of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Responsible consumption information, however, appears to be essential to stimulate this part of the consumption currently animated by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the void and dubious nature of the information would calm the ardours of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are as wary of the alleged performance of green products or services that are being put into their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habits and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their belief.
At 61%, they also favored shopping with local merchants and favored the purchase of food products grown in their region, the Barometer said.
Greener and more responsible - the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by caring about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, the Barometer says: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers said they used public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioral survey, which has just taken its first snapshot.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but only to the extent of one loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who hoped to donate $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard by giving him back his full cinematic vocation, do not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of the sources from the state offices.
A first action plan and demand of $12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have since been revised downward.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who heads the eXcentris dossier.
He sent her a final report about 10 days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the cabinet reached the SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31st to respond.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the gift of the State really needs to be dismissed.
Recall that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de cineparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to fund real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, a number of stakeholders were demanding substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céan, for ten years carried author cinema in his premises of the complex after having financed its construction, which could justify an exemption from the Treasury Board.
The lack of theaters for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
The Angus Company and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are running a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition to the wheel.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, The Parallel, continues to broadcast films on eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27th by screening the beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des deux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think about the downward proposals made to them.
The veil lifted over a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks shed light on what the U.S. sees as Canadians’ inferiority complex to Americans, but at the same time they betray Canadians’ sense of superiority to Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind when going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government get its budget passed in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the federal election campaign, recounts how the United States is not one of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday issues rather than to focus this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, “the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about it.”
The ambassador understands even less this "deafening silence" as the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this critical relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.”
Another expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, a business manager in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s survival in the confidence vote in the federal budget in early February, through which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30-40 billion stimulus plan,” Breese wrote.
Nowhere is there any mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties were making its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast on CBC send back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the kidnappings for muscular CIA interrogations.
Another cable reports that, in their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the case."
Finally, let’s note that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “murdered.”
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
The United Nations today proposed in Cancun a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that is almost a third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still hold 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, most of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That’s the equivalent of 70% of global fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance sheet another 5 Gt to achieve to stabilize by 2020 the increase of the climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates as heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy need is reduced by twice as much.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
They do not contain any mercury.
A number of specialists have posted reservations about compact fluorescent bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers are implementing instructions.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire awaits nervous announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the results of the presidential election in Côte d’Ivoire to be published “without delay” after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission missed Wednesday’s midnight deadline without releasing the results, three days after Sunday’s election.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had told television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
Calls for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied around the world on Wednesday.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the constitutional council cancelling “fraudulent” votes in the north, held by the former Forces nouvelles (FN) rebellion since the failed September 2002 coup.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said the FN's voter intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be canceled if Gbagbo's complaints are withheld by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Northerner Alassane Ouattara, who denies any connection with the ex-rebels, called the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had been split in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished first in the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France as defined by the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% counting the overseas departments), show the seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Second-quarter data were confirmed for 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is up 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people present in the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, raised to 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 point over three months, + 0.5 point over one year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 youth aged 15-24 were unemployed under the ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 point over three months as well as over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 and over, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only 25-49-year-olds benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has not published a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a leader of waste treatment companies and brother of the president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and nutted at the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, concealment, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It's easy to prosecute him for a multitude of wrongdoing bosses, it's something else to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP ahead of his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted, through his lawyers, to send the judge a memo before his hearing in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also put on trial Wednesday night and nuts.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than operate the landfills he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he was never aware of it, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted Wednesday for misappropriation of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
“My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts that are being blamed on him.”
"The investigating magistrate has taken this into account by not depriving him of his freedom," his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux, said.
Four other people were put on trial and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them placed under judicial supervision, said Deputy Republic Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted for "theft and misappropriation of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds".
Lastly, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with “recel for abuse of social property”.
Among those confronted by Mr. Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently caught in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of having been used to launder money from the big banditry.
The investigation is carried out as part of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in public procurement, especially in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill at La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Case of Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for “espionage”, kept the public abreast in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of US diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the undersides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going as far as giving them advice on how to deal with their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman was not in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they place in a raw light the way in which the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, there was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is titled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The Elysée’s strategic adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, will meet with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly detained nationals to Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “hammer constantly” in the media the words “fundamental human rights”, “innocence”, “immediate liberation”.
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to do it.”
Because, after the attempts of discussions through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters in delaying maneuvers".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was “a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he makes it known that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains stuck in Iran.
The Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, wonders about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iran’s clandestine nuclear program equipment acquisition networks, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier says that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only “completely taken by surprise by the judge’s decision,” but sought to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guard des seaux" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not go back on the judicial decision", he observes.
Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "narrow" supervision of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée spares no effort, through communiqués and “leaks” organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an “important” and “influenced” role as a “mediator”.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles repercuss the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the media blitz of French officials".
On what is based so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
“Despite their praiseworthy statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then looks at the reasons that prompted the Elysee to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort “is aimed at validating Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unearned".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris seeks to “show Syria what praise it can get by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
“But we thanked them anyway.”
“This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called “Cinderella” law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be tabled in parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16 said representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day.”
“We believe this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep,” Jo Rin, the ministerial official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit daily access to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who claim it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA nominates host countries
In turmoil over suspected corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appointed the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk taking precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is for sure, the 2018 edition of the FIFA Queen’s competition will take place in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 event will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
Therefore, the behind-the-scenes negotiations are likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to FIFA’s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the source of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), may have ruined the chances of his country, the birthplace of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC delivered a layer of it on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that pinned three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
There is nothing to displease FIFA and embarrass English officials, who have been in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-issue the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won in 2005 for London the organization of the 2012 Olympics.
Will this intense activity suffice to restore the coat of arms of England to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack assets with its stadiums already ready, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the grim economic and financial prospects of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a heavy outsider despite the shortcomings of its file (stays, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, based on the experience of 1994, appears as the logical favorites.
The world’s largest economic power, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to be a step ahead of Japan and South Korea, who have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-hosted the event in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would effectively make the Asian chances for 2022 lapse.
With Qatar, which launched the big game with futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weak TV rights paid (due to the time lag) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the obvious
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made it appear that he hesitated.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One warrant at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not a good fit with the mystery part attached to the presidential function.
Then you have to act as if there is always doubt.
One way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a grave air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of the year 2011".
Speaking before UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday night at the Elysée, the prospect of "two terms" has therefore sowed a bit of feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The president only recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has spoken about the presidential election, in a tone of humour, in such meetings.
“At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me,” he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words from before yesterday make him no more candidate than the day before; they make him no less.
If they get comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not Ségolène Royal’s entry into the competition that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
This is on the contrary because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are demanding an early start to the battle.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
“We have a candidate and there is no discussion in the UMP on this,” the Prime Minister’s entourage immediately and cautiously reacted.
"If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“He will always believe he can win,” corrects Alain Juppé, who is obviously resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain government bond purchases
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the way out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations that are to be completed by the end of the year.
As the European sovereign debt crisis requires, the Frankfurt-based issuer will probably not be able to afford to be so peremptory otherwise it will worsen a situation that is more tense today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be all the higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde praised the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say if she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its program of buying sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my thoughts for my European partners (...) ".
Last night, during his hearing in the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more dissatisfied with his intentions, merely stating that the program of buying government securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the eurosystem’s central banks have bought for €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the expectations of continued purchases (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect a noticeable change in course.
While lending of more than three months has already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB is still making unlimited allocations of liquidity on generous terms and for durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this to be extended by a few months.
“I can’t imagine that it will significantly change his program.”
“Otherwise it would risk causing new tensions in the short term,” said Commerzbank economist Michael Schubert.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds to animate an unreasonable market,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuer has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a balancing of the yields paid by the most fragile states," a major bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is turning its back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a little yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
Coming out of a meeting with the economy minister, the region’s presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as “indecipherable” and expect an “unpredictable” weekend, which he later denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with German long-term interest rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of hedge contracts against bankruptcy risk (CDS) had soared to 263 points, leading to a certain havoc in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the sluggishness of tax revenue that goes with it, causing the state to run the risk of not being able to cover its financing needs anymore.
The latest forecast from Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate expects 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (down from 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be put in place after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
“If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken,” said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
“The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
“There is no problem in the immediate, short or long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts required of Italy are less than those required of other countries,” said OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan.
There remains the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which early elections could be held at the end of March.
There would then be a period that would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris: “The Europeans, I believe it has been demonstrated on Sunday in the day and in the night, are obviously in solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency area.”
Although all relative, yesterday’s easing on European government bond rates brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor’s has announced that it could degrade Portugal’s debt rating, the most targeted target for speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly on the banking systems," say the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is much slower than market time.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it entails, European countries are stepping up discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis arrangements.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are well under way.
And this is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the ECOFIN at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the collimator of the markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform Far Eastern investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly preparing the ground for them.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in the funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are keen to avoid seeking international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms needed to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
While in Paris on November 24, Axel Weber had the first idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over to the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around €100 billion would suffice, “preferably” in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with, to date, 60 billion euros.
A council that has every chance of being examined carefully in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
The snowy episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and risk disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange watch due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienna, have been added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snowy episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments have been banned for heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking your vehicle only in case of necessity and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned in Picardie on Thursday.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to be cautious on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) on Thursday asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% at Orly due to the upcoming snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
We are talking in particular about 23 billion for the metro Grand Paris that the Société du Grand Paris is to build.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Now we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Corrigendum Finance Act, reviewed in the National Assembly’s Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, reads in the text of the draft law, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It reads: “The proceeds of this tax are €117 million per year.”
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that make?
Mystery.
This is not encoded in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
“It is specified that these tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,” reads the statement of reasons.
In the SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
“From the moment you create revenue, you can cover three-year studies and then tap into the $4 billion after that,” he said.
“It will be included in the budget and pulled over and over again.”
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion is still to the absent subscribers, may provoke a somewhat hectic parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avengers and spies in due diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as a scandal before the hypocrisy that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file made up of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those owned by Berlusconi), and Gaddafi’s sinisterly caricatural profile has long been for cabaret artists to sketch material.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of news already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats exactly what was already written in previous books (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix).
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (nor does he know where to look for news about the nonexistent), but because those who devote themselves to the occult believe only in what they already know, and that reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same goes for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or narrow-minded) the head of the secret service (otherwise he might be, whatever I know, a liberator), who holds only what he recognizes to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any educated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have become centers of espionage.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that any hacker can capture the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put both the victims and the “brothers” in crisis.
But let’s get back to the deep nature of what happened.
In Orwell’s day, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely proven since, being able to control every move through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected as the citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means taking away all.
WikiLeaks did nothing wrong to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put any confidential information online - that would be publishing it on a poster glued to the corner.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is in vain to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state flew around and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know well that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence to uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shackle.
The information will be kept as a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now advancing in crab, that is to say backwards.
A century after wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph over wires (telephones).
The (analog) videotapes had allowed the film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now the (digital) CDs only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, by macro-portions.
With the high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communications technology to return to horse-drawn cars.
One last remark.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
Now, it is the embassies that are asking the press for confidential information.
Climate: How France hacks its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to look at the fulfilment of the promises of fast-start and early-start financing by developed countries.
And the big French hacks are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (or 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU took the big game out to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, big side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciable and valued: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU has announced that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at it in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference year: international financing is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of the level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to spending in previous years or at the overall level of Public Development Assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to meet its commitment to “new and additional” financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their own calculation method.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ lent is equivalent to 1€ given.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present one euro that will be recovered as equivalent to one euro that is given... At most, it should be counted under its commitments only the cost of the loan for the lending country (i.e. the equivalent interest rate).
But France has no choice but to make such a reasoning: it “respects” its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1 € to fulfill its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice trick of pass!
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, it can make it appear that it is spending €420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to give if it suffices to lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to all climate discussions.
But there could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Warning of pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (formerly the Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem being treated", bought between July and September the foods usually consumed in four meals and a snack in a day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including the official recommendations – five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day – as well as sweets, were reviewed by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate’s record is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens, and five substances classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
“Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear from our survey that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven to be certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues that may disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemicals, one of which is banned in France.
The same goes for Kenyan green beans, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even bread wand and chewing gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the richest with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The ultimate risk to the consumer of this "cocktail of contaminants" is "probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-The Greens (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
