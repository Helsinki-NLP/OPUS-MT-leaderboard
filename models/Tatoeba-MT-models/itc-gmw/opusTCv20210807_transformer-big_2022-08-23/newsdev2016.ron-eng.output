Former head of Brazilian presidential cabinet brought before court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted accusations against the former head of Brazil’s presidential cabinet for his alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme over state-owned oil company Petrobras.
The federal prosecutor’s office said Jose Dirceu would be sued over allegations of corruption, fraud and money laundering this month.
Fourteen others will be tried, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former treasurer of Brazil’s ruling Workers’ Party, and Renato de Souza Duque, the former president of Petrobras’ business services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the ruling Workers’ Party taken into custody for ties to this scheme.
Dirceu served as chief of staff to former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested in early August from home, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a vote-buying scheme in Congress more than 10 years ago.
Prosecutors said Dirceu developed Petrobras’ bribery scheme, accepted bribes while in office, and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was shut down in late 2013 for the vote-bought scandal.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved about $2 billion in bribes and other illegal funds.
Some of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and its allies.
It would also include bribes to Petrobras executives in exchange for inflated contracts.
“Miracle” Recovery of a Survivor of the Peshawar Massacre
A paralyzed teenager after being shot four times in Pakistan's worst terrorist attack has achieved a "miraculous" recovery after undergoing treatment in the United Kingdom.
13-year-old Mohamed Ibrahim Khan had been told by doctors in Pakistan that he would never be able to walk again.
At least 140 people, mostly children, were killed when gunmen attacked the army’s public school in Peshawar last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will later be discharged from the hospital.
Exactly nine months ago, on an ordinary Tuesday morning, Mohamed stood at first aid and listened carefully to his teachers.
Even then, many armed men disguised in the uniforms of security guards entered the army’s public school.
They wore explosive belts and had a simple mission: to kill all the men, women, and children who stood in their way.
“I can’t forget what happened that day,” Mohamed said with a sharp glance.
I was sitting in the amphitheatre, asking questions... and then I heard gunshots outside.
The terrorists went inside and started killing. Our teacher was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he pulled four students out of the amphitheater while the carnage unfolded.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, yelling at him.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held his hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he in the head.
Most of those killed in the attack were students.
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed recalls that immediately after this he fainted and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the waist down.
Doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then in Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to walk again.
“When I saw him, I felt my soul come out,” said Mohamed’s father, Sher Khan.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son, who is so passionate about cricket, would ever be able to use his feet again.
They campaigned and sought help from Pakistani television, drawing support from famous people like Imran Khan, a cricketer turned politician.
Eventually, they were able to raise funds to take Mohamed to the UK and offer him treatment at the Harley Street private clinic in London.
Consultant neurosurgeon Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "afraid" when he arrived at the hospital.
“He had spent the last [several] months lying in bed, unable to move from one side to the other,” Malik says.
He was weak, put a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in very good shape.
A vertebra at the base of Mohamed's spine had been destroyed.
Mohamed had been shot in the shoulder, hip and back during the attack, and his lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
However, during a six-hour operation, Malik and his team were able to reconnect the nerve endings and rebuild the damaged part of the spine.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Exactly a week after the surgery, Mohamed got up and started taking steps and walking.
We did not expect such a good result.
It was a miracle,” he says.
Within two weeks of the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and begin the long recovery process.
Mohammed defied fate and began to walk again.
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the UK.
But he is determined to return to Pakistan, enlist in the military and fight terrorism.
“I feel like I have another chance at life,” he says, showing pictures of guns drawn by him next to school textbooks and pens.
Physically, Mohamed is getting stronger every day, but the psychological trauma he is going through is unimaginable.
“My anger has not diminished,” he confesses.
In my school, young children were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes a tear, comforts the child and says, “I see my son walking again.”
He will be able to continue his natural life.
The 4G “Super Voice” service from Three provides a better signal
Three uses a lower-frequency 4G spectrum that can cover a wider area
Mobile phone provider Three has launched a service in the UK that it says will improve reception inside buildings and in rural areas without a signal.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a lower frequency spectrum.
Other networks are also planning to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE)".
It only works with the Samsung Galaxy S5 at the moment, but recent iPhones will benefit from it in the coming months.
Three says up to 5.5 million customers will have access to the service by 2017.
Chief Technology Officer Bryn Jones said: “By the end of the year, one million of our customers will have access to better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more places than ever before.”
Stars are getting ready for the pantomime season
The pantomime season is very important for theaters across the UK, many of which are now preparing for this year’s season.
Now, at the Christmas theater participates some of the biggest names in showbusiness.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Cinderella – first as one of the evil sisters, and second as the fairy.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: “If I don’t do anything, I feel guilty.”
Steven Wilson was named the winner of the Progressive Music Awards.
Steven Wilson has often been named the most hard-working musician in the world of progressive rock.
The talented musician won three awards at the Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the Best Album of the Year award for Hand.
In its five-star review, The Guardian called the album “a smart, expressive and captivating work of art.”
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the driving force behind several musical projects, the most famous of which is the rock band Porcupine Tree.
Now, ahead of two closed house performances at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson releases a vinyl-only double LP, Transition, to showcase the “more affordable” side of his solo activity.
He told the BBC about his love of vinyl and his busy schedule and explained how comedian Matt Berry ended up opening his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up right at the end of the vinyl era and I remember that at the time I was looking forward to the CD, because vinyl was so annoying.
You bought a record, went home with him, had a scratch, and you had to bring it back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example classical music, they’re better than vinyl.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there’s nothing else you really value.
Having a vinyl is like having a beautiful painting hanging in the living room.
It’s something you can hold in your hand as you get absorbed in lyrics and overwhelmed by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it can’t be understood if some kids too young to remember vinyls like that kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl that you particularly care about?
I admit I got rid of all the vinyl in the '90s.
All the vinyls I have are bought again.
I started with the idea of redoing the collection I had at 15, but I crossed that limit.
The first album I ever bought was Out of the Blue by the Electric Light Orchestra.
If I still had the original, it would have had sentimental value, but, unfortunately, it’s somewhere through a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a gateway to potential new fans
Why did you release your new Transience compilation on vinyl?
It was originally conceived as an idea for Record Store Day, but we missed the opportunity.
My record company had suggested that I collect some of my shorter and more accessible songs.
I became slightly obsessed with the idea of doing something like “introducing Steven Wilson’s music” and I really wanted the project to be released only on vinyl.
Those who buy vinyl also get a high-resolution download version.
Are you worried that the album won’t show your music in its true light?
No, because although I focus on longer pieces of music, there is one thing I have always valued above all else: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses on technical complexity rather than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, have passed the test of time because they have always emphasized the melodic side and the atmosphere.
What are you doing at Albert Hall?
I don't want to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different each night.
In the first, there will be a version of the show Hand. Erase. that we had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night is going to be more of a foray into my history, and it’s more geared towards the fans who have followed me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show on the second night?
And me and the others on the tour team are big fans of the [Channel 4 comedy series] Toast of London, to the point where we always give quotes from it.
I thought about listening to Matt’s music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
We talked to him about our mutual love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely lucky to have him in the opening.
You've remixed albums from bands like XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does that influence your music?
I’m not consciously inspired by this, but inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they stay in your mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was arguably the most progressive old school album I’ve ever created.
I don’t think it was a coincidence that we had remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the year before.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because I had been working on Tears for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the busiest progressive rock musician.
Do you know?
You can delete the word progressive.
I think I’m probably one of the most obsessed people in the music world today and I don’t say that with pride, because, please believe me, it’s a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an incredibly strong work ethic.
If I don't do anything for a whole day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That’s why working on remixes was a gift, because it means I don’t have to do my music all the time.
The music industry is a tough place to make a career.
I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and am not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it’s a privilege, but if I were lazy I don’t think I would have survived.
Transition will launch in the UK on September 25.
Steven Wilson will perform at the Royal Albert Hall on September 28 and 29 as part of his 2015-2016 European tour.
New contract brings jobs back to Skytrans
The new Skytrans has re-hired some of the airline’s staff who had lost their jobs when the old Skytrans went bankrupt.
Skytrans, the refurbished company in northern Queensland, has been awarded a $25 million contract to transport gas company QGC employees, which means 18 crew members have regained their jobs.
Skytrans, a Wild family-owned company, became very active in January after the Newman government rewarded subsidized routes that made up much of the airline’s business.
Bankruptcy caused more communities to face potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, a federal and liberal lawmaker for Northern Queensland, was the voice of critics of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, chief executive of Skytrans, said the airline’s contract with QCG has already created jobs.
“We have managed to re-hire 18 full-time Skytrans personnel as pilots and crew members,” he said.
We are also delighted to have new staff with direct logistics experience in managing flight operations for QGC customers.
In just five months, we have increased our workforce by 100%, with 78 staff employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims for Skytrans to expand its flight operations from its headquarters in Cairns, which serves Cape York and the Torres Strait, and to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 return flights per week for Brisbane HQC staff and entrepreneurs to Chinchilla and Taroom locations on its 36-seat Dash-8 aircraft starting Monday, October 26.
Tony Nunan, chief executive of the HQC, said Skytrans received the contract following an auction.
“We are delighted that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a Queensland company,” he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains its high quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal MP and fresh mom Kelly O'Dwyer gets advice to make a bigger reserve of milk to avoid missing votes in the House
There will be more women in the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull’s new government will be inaugurated on Monday and there are strong signals that more women will occupy the portfolios.
One of the government’s rising stars, Kelly O’Dwyer, has been advised to make a bigger reserve of milk for her newborn to avoid breastfeeding interfering in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from government discipline officer Scott Buchholz, who later consulted with his Labour counterpart to find out which approach is best for a nursing MP, according to the ordinances in place.
Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter, Olivia.
According to the ordinances in force - the set of rules that govern the behavior of parliamentarians in the House - breastfeeding mothers get a power of vote in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn’t know about this exemption before he consulted opposition discipline officer Chris Hayes on the issue.
Things rushed on two occasions when O'Dwyer could not attend a division meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to give a speech because he had just begun breastfeeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the MP was thinking of making a larger reserve of milk instead of breastfeeding.
Scott Buchholz, MP from Queensland, is in charge of government discipline.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
Both declined to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but sources separate from Buchholz and O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media that the Higgins representative was furious when she was told to make a bigger reserve of milk instead of breastfeeding her daughter, Olivia, who was born in May.
This fact is revealed even as new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working on building his new cabinet.
Buchholz, a liberal national lawmaker from Queensland, was promoted to the position of head of discipline by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott as part of the negative effect of this year’s February censorship attempt.
O'Dwyer, pictured alongside Labour's Amanda Rishworth and her son, Percy, is one of the three mothers in Parliament.
The ex-discipline officer, Phillip Ruddock, was removed just days after Abbott faced a no-confidence motion to remove him from office, and was replaced by Buchholz.
Another Abbott supporter, Andrew Nickolic, a Tasmanian liberal, was also promoted and appointed responsible for the deputy discipline.
Nickolic had lately been keeping the front page of the newspapers, after it was revealed that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to give up the leadership of Abbott.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time since the birth of her daughter, Olivia, in May.
She is one of three women who became mothers this year.
Labour's spokeswoman Catherine King said on Wednesday that voting power for breastfeeding mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
“She’s [seven years old] now,” she wrote on Twitter.
The discipline officer should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted to the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under the Turnbull, which said on Wednesday that it wants more women in its cabinet.
“No one wants to see more women in power, influence, in parliament, in ministries, across the country,” she told reporters.
Abbott included only one woman in his first cabinet and, after sustained pressure to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman into the cabinet after the December reshuffle.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will markets react?
Mal Maiden, an editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull could have on Australia’s business sector.
On Tuesday, business lobby groups didn’t know how to show their enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country’s reins as prime minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them would have wanted to see had been abandoned under the leadership of Tony Abbott.
Or it had simply ended in a negotiated suspension because of Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" political style.
Interest group representatives spoke in unison about their hope in Turnbull’s ability to satisfy the public interest, reach a political agreement, and do things right.
So what exactly are the country’s biggest companies and their representatives expecting from our new prime minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull’s ability to overcome negative publicity.
Turnbull himself set as a starting goal the free trade agreement with China.
In his first media speech announcing the challenge, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) was the focal point of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In an August speech, Turnbull criticized the Labour Party’s “disturbing outbursts of economic chauvinism” on the issue and expressed concern over the racist tempting of critics.
“In the Chafta context, the winners are, numerically, far more than the losers,” he said in the same speech.
The business community hopes he will win this debate.
Don Argus, the legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is a key point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the 100 largest companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this deal, and this will be a first test of Turnbull’s ability to overcome negative publicity and negotiate with the entire Senate.
Small Business Minister Bruce Billson supports the recommendations of the Harper Analysis.
This could lead to some divergences with the business environment from the outset.
The impact assessment applies to large mergers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer from lack of competition.
It is called “effect assessment” because it takes into account not only the actions and intentions of the company, but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way this evaluation is written is extremely important for the outcome.
Harper’s analysis of competition law recommends a change in the assessment of the effects, which will make it harder for large corporations to ban smaller operators from the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Business Council and major retailers.
Turnbull now knows he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he’ll do next.
The CAA jumped to say that if Turnbull follows the recommendations of the Harper analysis, consumers will have to pay higher prices.
It’s ironic that the entire business community has advised the new prime minister to have greater respect for cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to be doing by letting Bruce Billson, the small business minister (who is on Harper’s side) make his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers followed women between the ages of sixty and eighty.
Those who mainly eat plants, fish and olive oil have “significantly” reduced the likelihood of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard is questioning the multiplication board.
Terrence Howard thinks I understand arithmetic completely.
The Empire villain told Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn’t believe that one or one is equal to one.
“How can it be equal to one?” he said.
If one or one makes one, it means that two has no value, since one or two itself has no effect.
One or one makes two, because the square root of four is two - so what is the square root of two?
There should be one, but we're told there are two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's professors disagreed with his theory, so he dropped out of the Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
“You can’t close your eyes when you know something is wrong,” he said.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics the name "Terryology".
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassembling scissors, wire, magnets and plastic sheets to illustrate his "one-time-one" theory and other similar theories.
He told the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, spent up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The Rolling Stone editor described Howard's creations as "bricks with infinitely more complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes, tied together with copper wire or trapped with magnets".
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive U.S. Patent 20150079872 A1 (“Systems and Methods for Enhanced Building Tile Applications”).
Also, the actor in "In the Footsteps of an Idol" also says that Pythagoras Einstein and Tesla would "craze up" if they saw Terryology.
“You know,” he says, “I’ve been wondering since I was three or four years old why a bubble takes a round shape?”
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hopes to change the whole course of education.
“This will be the last century in which our children will learn that one or one makes one,” he said.
They will no longer have to grow in ignorance.
In twenty years from now, they will know that one or one makes two.
We are about to reveal a new truth.
The true universal mathematics.
We'll check in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande impersonates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
On Tuesday, during The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying his vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did a good job of imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also performed versions of “I Can’t Feel My Face” from The Weeknd.
This week, Grande's name was in the press.
On the same day he was also at "Good Morning America", where he opened the show with the incident of the lynx of the donut.
Taco Bell hopes the “Cantina” restaurants it will serve will become urban hotspots
Do you want to spend an elegant evening in the city?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22, the Mexican-style fast food chain will open a new location in Chicago’s Wicker Park area, offering a tapas-style menu of appetizers, a fresco painted by a local artist, and even alcoholic beverages.
It is the first test location of the “Taco Bell Cantina” restaurants of the chain, which caters to young people, concentrations in increasing numbers in the centers of cities.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6,000 restaurants in the U.S., has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap, fast-cooked food such as the extremely popular Doritos Locos Taco.
With an average Taco Bell bill of $7, the company used drive-through service and fast services to attract the number of customers needed to make a profit.
But Taco Bell says that in order to address the new generation that is “looking for more central urban environments in which to live, work and have fun,” test locations need to follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
In order to do a drive-through, you need the ground.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
“You can’t afford it,” Neil Borkan, the Taco Bell franchisee who will operate the Chicago location, told USA TODAY.
At the Chicago location, the new menu will be prepared alongside traditional Taco Bell offerings, in an open kitchen, where “you’ll be able to see the food yourself” before it’s prepared, Meredith Sandland, chief development officer at Taco Bell, told The Associated Press.
The new venue will also serve wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages, following the recent example of many of the Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer “evening” menus that include beer, wine, and snacks.
One thousand of the approximately 1,900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic beverages.
The company said another Taco Bell Cantina location will open in San Francisco near AT&T Park this month, replacing drive-through service and parking with an interior yard and a sales window.
These changes in location, atmosphere and appendices indicate that the fast food chain wants to attract other types of customers than those who are looking for fast food at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality culinary line in 2012, when it inaugurated more expensive Cantina and burritos menus to compete with Chipotle, the project being supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new dishes.
If successful, the Cantina restaurants will be another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said it plans to open 2,000 restaurants in the United States by 2022.
As Sandland told the AP, "a few hundred" of them will be of the "Cantina" type.
Phones on in the middle of the night: Elton John courtesy of Putin
Russian President Vladimir Putin telephoned Elton John on Monday night, just days after the British artist publicly said he wanted to meet the Russian politician to discuss Russia’s anti-gay legislation together.
The self-proclaimed gay singer tried unsuccessfully to get a meeting with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, a year after defying protests in the country and holding two concerts in 2013, in a hectic period in the country's history, following the passage of controversial laws banning "homosexual propaganda" among minors.
In 2014, in St. Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and made the following statement to fans: “Although I am gay, I have always felt welcome here in Russia.”
If I wasn’t honest about who I am, I wouldn’t be able to write these songs.
It's not gay propaganda.
They are the way I express life.
If we start punishing people for it, then the world will lose its humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist revealed that he wants to meet Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information about the phone conversation between the two personalities.
Cocos "singed" all in the ANRP file
The businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a heartbreaking conviction, “singing” in front of the judges and detailing how he shared the millions of euros with former members of the ANRP Commission.
Audited yesterday at the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the case in which he is tried alongside his son Alin Cocos, the former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Compensation within the ANRP, Dorin Cocos was struck as if by the lightning of sincerity.
He acknowledged all the accusations and told the judges how he helped businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the ANRP’s damages, instead demanding that he be tried faster and that his cooperation be taken into account.
Thus, Cocos showed that he knew Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he befriended him after several real estate deals.
He said that Sergiu Diacomatu met him in 2010, and he told him that he was working at ANRP.
Later we found out that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is vice president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at ANRP, we asked him to help us.
I promised him money, 2.5 million euros, money that I told him I would give him in several trances.
I also gave him political support to stay in office.
“Diacomatu told me then that he was helping me, but that he needed support,” Dorin Cocos said in court.
He also said that later, through an acquaintance, he came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then head of the Central Compensation Commission, to which he promised 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian’s second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, we also gave him five million euros.
For the Dumitrean lice a million euros, Dragos Bogdan gave 800,000 euros.
I need to put all this money in trances to make sure the case is settled.
“That’s what I told them: to settle the case, to make up for it,” Cocos said.
Asked why he ended up doing these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian’s second case.
I received, for the second case, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I was left with only 1.2 million euros.
In 2013, I also met Alina Bica.
“I never talked to her about money or land,” Cocos said.
He also noted that "it was notable that at the ANRP all the members understood each other before the meeting."
I didn't feel like they weren't going to vote positive.
All the functions were given politically in the ANRP, but I personally did not help the Diacomatu politically.
“I told him I was helping him politically just to calm him down,” Cocos said.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was at the DNA yesterday for only five minutes, during which time he filed new documents in the file "Turceni - Ruinari".
Victor Ponta leaked a document from the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the prosecutor of the case will receive him for a discussion on the file in which he is investigated for forgery in privately signed documents, complicity in tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went on his own initiative to the DNA, although the documents that he could have sent through the lawyer.
This was not the case, as the prosecutor did not have time, the prime minister leaving after five minutes, during which time he left several documents to the recording.
I wanted to file (on file) the decision of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, which explains what happened to contracts for the provision of services.
I say we did work, the prosecutor says we didn’t, the European Court of Justice told us to see each other, because as long as the fees were paid, it’s okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, for sure, for all countries of the European Union, we do not have a case here," Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on leaving the DNA.
Ponta also said that, from his point of view, the decision of the European Court should apply if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister is waiting for the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call him again to the hearings, but also to give a response to his requests, including disjunction of the file.
Iohannis enjoys his mandate without a TV.
In today’s Romania, there is no legal provision that obliges you to watch TV.
And don’t even own such a device, since you pay your TV fee with the power bill.
But if you're the head of state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is understood that the post of the President of Romania is also included in the connection to everyday realities.
President Iohannis immerses himself daily in total silence in his office in Cotroceni
Only to the astonishment of even his closest men at the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Iohannis refuses to have a TV in the presidential office.
And after he doesn’t watch TV – no shows, not even RTL or Pro Sieben – the president doesn’t listen to radio or read the newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive the “negative monitoring” that, for example, its predecessor demanded with priority.
Instead, Iohannis is happy to receive only the report with the news that puts him in a positive light.
And besides this informational self-isolation, in which the only gap is accessing Facebook, much more serious is the blockage to which, through its passivity, the head of state pushes the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that’s because, even though it’s been such a bitter time since his installation, Iohannis hasn’t yet signed the loyalty statements of more than half of the Presidential Administration’s employees.
This is becoming an increasingly serious issue, both from a human and legal point of view.
Silence and Peace
To those in the presidential entourage it is already clear that no one and nothing can spoil the "feng shui" from the office of the head of state.
Where there is peace and quiet.
That’s right, only after nine o’clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when the former mayor of Sibiu asks for the presence of the officials.
A custom that probably hasn’t gotten rid of since he was running the city’s primary on Cibin.
And the fact that Iohannis does not want television in the office has already born countless legends, being already people from the Cotroceni Palace who have come to lean towards the possibility that the president would try to avoid his monitoring.
Especially since he doesn't have a radio.
Only, at this rate, they are going to meditate as soon as possible in the dark, because even the luminaires can hide the technique of audio-video recording.
Just good
Also, another strangeness from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the head of state only of the "pzoitive monitoring" of the president's activity.
That is, if there is any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the head of state will receive its content on bioru.
If not, no!
Even more interesting is that it was banned from "negative monitoring" in the conditions in which, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only for watching nightly TV shows in which he was criticized, but demanded, every morning, with priority, the negative news.
That doesn’t mean that musai helped him, but that gesture matters!
And at least he can never have an excuse for not being well informed from alternative sources.
Not outside, not confirmed
Now, after all, you lick it and the mystery why Klaus Iohannis doesn’t want to watch TV.
Until then, it would be more important to resolve, under whatever formula, the contractual situation of the hundreds of employees of the Presidential Administration.
Who, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the acting head of state and who must also bear his signature.
However, from December until now, Klaus Iohannis has not signed even half of these statements for confirmation, although this was expected to happen within 30 days at the latest.
So hundreds of employees, representing over half of the staff at the Cotroceni Palace, are in an uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state does not personally sign their statement, they should be kicked out.
All of them have not received the negative opinion.
So, for one thing, I can come at any time to the auditors, who will find that, for over half a year, so many hundreds of people have received their salaries at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
That is until the president decides whether to remove them or confirm them in positions, the decision being strictly his.
Authorities said a teenager was plotting an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the United States.
A teenager’s ISIS-inspired plan to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S. was more of an “aspirational one” than an operation, a police source told Fox News on Tuesday.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August when law enforcement thwarted the plan.
The plan is the same to which Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, the president of Homeland Security, referred during an interview on Sunday, a source told Fox News.
“We are very carefully monitoring threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States,” McCaul told ABC’s “This Week.”
Pope Francis was not mentioned as the specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security said on August 14 that the teenager was planning to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, targeting a foreign official during a high-level event.
The bulletin states that the minor has been radicalized through social networks.
The teenager may be suffering from a mental illness, a law enforcement source told Fox News, but without giving exact details of the young man's illness.
Also on Sunday, McCaul acknowledged the potential for an attack by a so-called “lone wolf” on the nation-wide level and said he was informed by the Secret Service of a “strictly secret location” for the pope’s visit.
And with that comes a big security risk... But as the date gets closer, I think we’ll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.

The medieval skeleton found in the tree suffered a violent death, experts say
Irish archaeologists have unveiled stunning details of the strange medieval skeleton found at the root of a 215-year-old tree.
The beacon in Collooney, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, bringing to light the macabre view of a skeleton trapped between its roots.
The Irish National Monuments Service brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to excavate and analyze the remains, uncovering a horrifying story.
“He was killed violently,” Marion Dowd, director of Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, told FoxNews.com.
In the upper part of the chest he has knife wounds. He still has such a trace in his left hand, which suggests that he was trying to defend himself.
The skeleton is of a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
“We don’t know if he was killed in battle or in a personal fight,” Dowd says, noting that the body was buried after the national ritual, with its head facing west.
“He was probably buried by family or community,” she added.
Dowd told FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree did not come out of the tomb.
“It was just a coincidence, the context is unusual,” she said.
There are historical documents that attest that there were a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect of the discovery: the height of the young man.
“It was 1 meter 77,” says Dowd.
For early medieval society, that means a lot.
Federal Government Spends $1.5 Million to Study What Babies Think About Food
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has spent nearly $1.5 million studying what young children think about food.
The project, dubbed “The Way Babies and Toddlers Perceive Food,” is being conducted by the University of Chicago and has so far determined that infants are not prone to eating foods licked by other people or that have sneezed by other people.
According to the project’s funder, “Adequate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have nutritionally healthy diets.”
There is evidence to suggest that early eating patterns of babies and toddlers have long-lasting consequences for lifelong health.
The premise for this study is that research on how babies view food is lacking.
“Despite the complexity and significance of food selection, child development psychologists have surprisingly devoted little attention to studying how babies and toddlers perceive, learn, and understand food,” he said.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on food choice and consumption in infants and toddlers.
Researchers say babies have “limited knowledge in the food field.”
Children between the ages of three and six “know more about food than babies and toddlers,” but they are “extremely mofturous consumers.”
An actress who starred in Star Trek: Voyager is charged with indecent exposure in Tennessee.
An actress who starred in the television series Star Trek: Voyager has been arrested in eastern Tennessee on charges of exposing herself in front of children.
Several media outlets report that 41-year-old actress Jennifer Ann Lien, who played Kes in the TV series, is charged with two indecent exposure offenses involving children under the age of 13, according to the arrest report.
Officers at the sheriff’s office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant to Lien’s home in Harriman on Sept. 3, where they say they found it empty under a blanket on the sofa.
Officers said Lien refused their requests to dress.
Harriman Police Chief Randy Heidle says Lien was charged with several counts, including aggravated bodily harm, after the April incident where Lien entered a police car with his personal car.
It is not yet known if he has a lawyer.
Police identify killed victim found in Epping forest
A man whose decaying corpse was discovered in a tourist forest has been identified.
On September 9, 53-year-old Hidir Aksakal was found near the Hollow Ponds in Epping Forest, northeast of London.
The Turkish-born man lived in Margate, Kent, and had close connections to the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north of London.
He was last seen in the Green Lanes on Monday morning, August 17.
A post-mortem analysis proved he was killed, and detectives say his body was probably in Epping Forest for several weeks.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo of the Metropolitan Police said: “Mr. Aksakal was very well known locally as the Cetin Boxer and we hope to learn from the Green Lanes community information to help us in the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a crowded and popular tourist spot where there is a cafe and a lake for boat rides.
It is also surrounded by busy streets.
We ask everyone who has been in the area in the last few weeks and may have noticed some unusual or suspicious activity to come and talk to us.
Super boss: six women juggling between motherhood and work
Unlike any other country in the world, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, there is no centralized policy on paid maternity leave in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer announced she was pregnant with twins but was planning to take a very short maternity leave and “work in” her spare time, the 40-year-old was widely criticized for encouraging a culture that awaits the superwoman or nothing.
But is Mayer herself a symbol of the top woman, to blame for unrealistic expectations?
How are other women leaders doing?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Bureau of Labor Enforcement, had just gotten a government job in Washington, D.C. a few years ago, when her boss stunned her with unexpected advice.
“I don’t know anything about you,” her boss said.
But if you’re going to make a family in the future, start getting your vacation right now.
Patel’s employer was the federal government, and she didn’t get a day’s paid maternity leave as part of her employment contract.
At the time, Patel was single and very career-focused, and the family was the last thing she thought about.
But she listened to the advice of her boss.
She avoided taking her medical leave for four years, so when she became pregnant with her first child two years ago, she had taken three months of paid leave.
Six months ago, when he gave birth to his second child, Patel could no longer apply the same strategy.
The four months of vacation he took were completely unpaid.
Patel says she didn’t feel any rejection from her colleagues, but she has a problem with the structure of the job.
“I find it very discouraging for anyone trying to have a family,” she says.
Send a message: Your country has no value in becoming a parent.
Karen Choi, vice president at the asset management firm Capital Group, says any employed woman who is also a mother should be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the juggling of motherhood and job as “a constant struggle.”
The secret to not sinking is to have “an incredibly family by your side” and a nanny and a babysitter, to accept that there are things you’re not going to be the best at (“not everyone can be Martha at home”) and just go through it.
Choi says she took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting at two-and-a-half months for the first and ending at six months for the last.
That makes her an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child is sick, he has a fever, he vomits and you stay up all night to take care of him and know that the next morning you have to take the other children to school, then go to work...
It becomes very complicated,” she says.
But her company has backed her up and says the performance of her investment portfolio has not suffered at all.
When she entered the finance industry after college, about 20 of her college colleagues had chosen the same path, she says.
Today, about 90% of them have won.
Women who quit the job and then start again no longer have the same chances at well-paid top positions, she says.
It is difficult to remain: “In the short term it is a sacrifice, but in the long term you can see the results.”
However, her children helped make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me move forward is that I want to be a role model for them.
The idea of being an example to her four children is what motivates 48-year-old scientist and professor Kelly Posner.
Children know that their mother is actually helping to save lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Center for Suicide Risk Assessment at Columbia University, says it’s important for women to know that they can have a “great goal” in their careers and fulfill it.
It's very important for women to think they can have a vision.
Most people can’t believe it,” she says.
She once gave a live presentation of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a webinar when she was eight months pregnant.
He also helped the technology, she says, because he can stop the car and answer the phone after taking his kids or answer an email on the go.
The juggling between motherhood and a demanding career has been helped by an optimistic personality, inclined towards solving problems, she says. By the ability to bring things to a successful conclusion even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33, the executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and mother of two, says that making motherhood and career work together only through private aid networks, such as nannies, is life.
“You shouldn’t have luck or win the lottery to be successful,” she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families – mentioning very low wages, poor health care, and the lack of paid maternity leave.
“As a society, we don’t care about each other,” she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who just gave birth.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while attending law school, gave birth to her child while receiving a scholarship.
With a husband and child relying on the scholarship’s healthcare, the labor leader was able to take a two-week maternity leave, then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashion designer and mother of two, says fewer women will abandon their profession if they receive more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining agreed-upon schedules and accepting that working effectively does not mean staying over schedule.
At the forefront of logistical constraints, Mosko says, is the additional pressure to activate in a field where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of lack of taste (“mother’s clothing” is one of the most serious insults).
“The image is part of our job – it lifts you up or pulls you down,” she explains.
Mosko’s “permanent negotiation” for her multiple roles to work harmoniously means keeping her chic look and a beautiful bag in her hand, but sometimes a toy-two falls out of it.
If he remembers that men are fathers too, society could allow women to do more.
People don’t judge men as not good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and chief executive officer of the New York Housing Authority, which handles the housing of more than 400,000 New Yorkers and employs more than 11,000 people, says motherhood and career do not mean talking about “balance.”
The notion of balance is a little inappropriate.
It’s more like a rocker,” she says.
A mother of three children, one of whom is only three months old, she just took a seven-week maternity leave after giving birth this year.
“It was a very important time for the agency,” she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to take paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible schedule, which meant leaving early or late, so she could breastfeed her baby.
Olatoye, who runs with her girlfriends every morning that ends at 06:00 (‘cheaper than therapy’), is still breastfeeding.
At work, he tried to create a “car-friendly” environment, where a child’s delay is allowed, and answering emails doesn’t necessarily have to be sent from the office.
“The concept and notion of family has changed and is changing a lot,” Olatoye says.
“The family is very different from what it was 25 or even 10 years ago.”
The job is the one that needs to adapt.
Russian humourists say they tricked Elton John into making a phone call from Putin
To the Cynics it seemed too nice to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, to Sir Elton John, a singer and activist for the rights of sexual minorities, in which he discussed the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it wasn’t true: despite an exuberant Instagram post thanking the Russian leader for approaching him on the issue, it immediately became clear that whoever called him on Monday night certainly wasn’t Putin.
The Kremlin had already declared that it had no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian humourists admitted that they, not the president, had been the foreign voices on the other end of the conversation.
“We thought it was unlikely that Putin would want to meet him or call him, or at least not too soon,” says Vladimir “Vovan” Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague, Alexei “Lexus” Stoliarov, called himself the president’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov.
“But it looks like Elton John was really expecting this phone call, so he immediately thought it was really a conversation with the right people,” he told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.
He said, “Thank you, it was the surprise of the day.”
This day and this conversation was the most wonderful and delightful of my life.
In order to perfect John’s embarrassing situation, the two announced they would publish a recording of the conversation on a popular Russian nighttime show.
John's representatives did not give statements about the speculations of hoaxes.
The story is based on comments the singer made over the weekend, in which she criticized Putin for his “ridiculous” attitude toward homosexuals while campaigning for LGBT rights in Kiev, especially criticizing a Russian law passed in 2013 that bans the spread of “propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations” among minors.
“I’d like to meet [Putin], let’s talk,” John told the BBC, saying that while the idea was “probably unrealistic,” it still deserved a try.
Then, on Monday evening, the singer sparked distrust from observers when he posted a message on a social network, saying Putin responded to his critics by taking the phone and calling him.
He said they were “looking forward to meeting [the president] face to face to discuss LGBT equality in Russia.”
Unfortunately for John, it wasn’t Putin at the other end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for making jokes of many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks English well, played Peskov and claimed to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told reporters on Tuesday that Putin would be "ready to meet Elton John and answer all his questions," but that no such request had been received from the singer in the Kremlin.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the Instagram post, he added, “especially because it’s not written entirely in correct English.”
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written with the same grammar mistakes.
Even before the Russian duet declared its public farce, local media outlets already suspected that John had been the victim of a joke.
Some online users had identified Krasnov as guilty, known for the hoaxes made to politicians with phones he records and posts on his YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Joking phone calls to the public, then publishing records has become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many to be the initiator of the genre, has developed a talent for shaming Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed by telephone on Ukrainian television imitating Anton Gerashchenko, the direct adviser to the interior minister, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Gerashchenko so well that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoiski, for more than six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to mass street protests after reports of massive fraud.
Posing as Arkadi Dvorkovich, then-president's adviser Dmitry Medvedev, he convinced the president of the electoral commission, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to fire him.
Among his victims were former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, mayor of Kiev and boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, and Russian sports minister Vitali Mutko, who apologised for the drunken behavior of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov reportedly called Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, posing as the son of dismissed Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych.
He was so convincing that the person on the other end, whose voice resembled that of Lukashenko, offered him asylum.
John’s initial claim that he would like to talk to Putin has provoked a huge reaction in Russia.
St. Petersburg lawmaker Vitali Milonov, who contributed to the “propaganda” law, told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with a “subject so irrelevant” and that he was ready to meet with singers to explain Russia’s position.
The Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online poll for readers, in which 39% of respondents felt that Putin and John should meet, and 22% felt that such a meeting would damage Putin’s reputation.
New study shows more people die from air pollution than from malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new baseline study, more than 3 million people die prematurely from outdoor air pollution, less than from malaria and HIV/AIDS combined.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is burning wood and coal for home heating and cooking, but the research reveals that an equally alarming reason is agricultural emissions from Europe and the US, where they are the main cause of these deaths.
The report warns that if no action is taken, the number of deaths – already equivalent to six deaths per minute – will double by 2050.
“These projections should be a wake-up call for public health agencies around the world,” said Professor Michael Jerrett, an environmental health expert at the University of California, who was not involved in the research.
Most of the deaths caused by air rain are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
They cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three-quarters of the 3.3 million deaths annually, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
The research did not include the effects of indoor air pollution, for example from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause another 3.4 million deaths per year.
The new study, published in the journal Nature, is the first to highlight various sources of outdoor air pollution and estimate the number of premature deaths they cause, taking into account road traffic, fossil-fuel power plants and other sources.
The researchers used a detailed computer model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on diverse populations, including new information about how pollution affects the inhabitants of China and India.
A third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of smoke-extracting fuels, such as wood and coal, for heating homes or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of which are recognized hazards.
Consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of India’s 645,000 annual deaths and a third of China’s 1.4 million annual deaths.
But the research found that agricultural ammonia emissions had a “remarkable” impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the Max Planck Chemical Institute in Germany, who led the research.
One-fifth of deaths globally are caused by these emissions, which come mainly from cattle, poultry and pigs and from excess fertiliser use.
Ammonia reacts with exhaust gases from traffic and industry and produces tiny particles, being the main cause of death from air pollution in the eastern United States, Japan and Europe.
“For London, agriculture is the main source,” Lelieveld says.
Across the UK, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still a major factor in developed countries, causing a fifth of deaths, despite measures against polluting vehicles.
This has caused only 5% of deaths globally, but the figure could rise as more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution from coal-fired power plants has been significant globally, causing one in seven deaths.
In the U.S., it is the main single factor, causing a third of the 55,000 deaths annually, compared to 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in arid and dusty regions, has caused nearly one-fifth of the global deaths caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, accounting for 92% of deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
“The overlap between the high pollution level and the high population speaks volumes about public health, but nothing is known about the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths,” Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and potentially important for protecting public health globally.
It is now assumed that all particles are equally toxic.
But if fuel combustion is more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, Jerrett says, “the discovery is very valuable...because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and because it suggests that much more attention needs to be paid to agricultural sources, both by scientists and policymakers.”
Dr Oliver Wild, an atmospheric specialist at Lancaster University in the UK, said: “The study really underscores the need for air quality control to avoid these deaths, especially in heavily populated areas of Asia.”
Victor Ponta’s statement further strains relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, Romanian prime minister talks about attitudes reminiscent of Nazism
Relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement of the construction of a fence at the border with Romania, after the one at the Serbian border, have experienced a new depreciation following the declarations made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who on Monday accused the authorities in Budapest of treating the refugees "with a bat and inserted".
Hungarian diplomats have reacted harshly to the "extremist and lying" claims, but neither has Victor Ponta let himself be lowered and accused government officials in the neighboring country of being "a disgrace" to Europe.
It is not the first time Ponta has tried to strain Romanian-Hungarian relations through declarations made in delicate or electoral moments.
It all started with a statement made on Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he tries to argue that Romania can not receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them with bats and inserts.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu put himself at the head of an ugly and horrible feeling that existed in all societies, namely a xenophobic feeling.
It’s good to have a discussion, but it’s up to us to solve the problem.
“We’re going to treat those people like we do,” Victor Ponta said Monday.
It’s not clear what Victor Ponta meant when he talked about taking the refugees, but the Czech Republic was recently at the center of criticism after writing numbers on the hands of migrants on several trains, in a gesture that recalled the Nazi procedure used to identify Jewish prisoners in concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, taken over by magyaridok.hu, that perhaps the domestic political crises that have shaken the position of Victor Ponta make him make statements "extremist and lying".
The Romanian businessman in Budapest has been summoned to provide explanations, Mediafax informs, citing MTI.
“Mr. Victor Ponta recently made inappropriate statements about how Hungary handles the migrant crisis,” the ministry said.
Levante Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian MAE, expressed "surprise" about Victor Ponta's "constant attempts to save his controversial moral position through anti-Hungarian lies," the statement said.
“I don’t want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives – but read the report below and you will understand the outrage that I feel, as a European man and citizen, about mentalities and attitudes that Europe has only seen in the 1930s and 40s!!!
He argues that, like other European policies, he has a “duty” to draw attention to and sanction “the constant behavior of Hungarian top government officials” who are “a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union” through “anti-Semitic attitudes,” “treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now into the refugee crisis!”
“Strike, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem – they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are no better political decision-makers than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!”
During the evening, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main subject was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, Ponta wondered what would happen if the Hungarian military grabbed and shot or killed children or women, in a speech in which he made several references to Nazism.
UDMR President Kelemen Hunor also intervened in the dispute, saying the Romanian authorities should not have a "sentimental approach" to Hungary's intention to build a fence at the border.
The leader of the UDMR says that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or Romanian citizens, he shows that the fence could even help our country not become an intense route transited by migrants who want to reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to point out, to say, that we must not hysterize, to take this whole thing as something against Romania and we must not use it to aggravate anyway the bad relations between the two governments, because it is not the case.
I believe that any sentimental, visceral approach is not okay.
“We need to see the rational side, see why we got here and we need to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, against the Romanian citizens and it does not impede free movement between the two states, inside the EU,” said Kelemen Hunor.
The West ignored Russia’s offer in 2012 to remove Bashar al-Assad from Syria’s leadership.
Russia proposed more than three years ago to remove Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as part of a peace deal, according to a senior official involved at the time in closed-door negotiations between Western countries and the Russian Federation.
Former Finnish president and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Martti Ahtisaari said Western powers had not taken advantage of the proposal since then.
Since 2012, tens of thousands have died and millions more have fled the country, sparking the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held talks with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
During the talks, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin offered a plan that included a proposal to Assad to step down at some point after the start of peace talks between the regime and the opposition.
He proposed three things:
One, we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two, we need to initiate a dialogue between Assad and the opposition immediately.
"Three - we need to look for an elegant way for Assad to withdraw," Ahtisaari said, reporting on the position of the Russian ambassador.
But Ahtisaari, the United States, Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator would fall, that they ignored the Russian ambassador’s proposal.
“It was a missed opportunity in 2012,” continued the former president of Finland.
Officially, Russia has strongly supported Bashar al-Assad over the four-and-a-half years of war, insisting that his removal cannot be a proposal in any peace deal.
Assad believes that Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow has recently begun sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria in an effort to stabilise the Assad regime and confront Islamic State extremists.
Antenna 3’s live Internet program will be available for a fee
Antena 3 informed its viewers on Tuesday that from November 1 its live program will be able to be watched online for a fee, based on a monthly subscription.
In a "letter to the viewers", trust Intact's news station states that "we do this with a close heart, wishing to stay with us in this new stage, imposed by the conditions of the market".
According to the same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who follow us online", the television promising that the viewing will be at a very good quality.
Antena 3 claims that "all these live broadcasts from home and abroad, campaigns, daily news were and are possible through a constant financial effort, assumed, which has meant a constant redevelopment and focus on quality".
We have been able to support ourselves, as offline and online distributors have contributed nothing to the content provided.
The announcement comes on the condition that the news television program is accessible on a subscription basis and on the Antena Play online platform, where, by the way, the recordings of the broadcasts from Antena were most often exclusively accessible.
Reports show that marine animal and plant populations have halved in the last 40 years
The scale of the crisis facing marine animals and plants is documented in detail in a study that states that marine species around the globe, including those essential to human food safety, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures from multiple directions across the global ocean ecosystem combine and create a whirlwind of difficulties for almost all marine creatures, WWF’s Living Blue Planet report says.
Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and seagrass, on which many other species depend, have registered a significant decline, while entire populations of commercially valuable fish, such as macro and tuna, have declined steeply by three-quarters since the 1970s.
Many coral reefs, usually described as ocean rainforests due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by the middle of this century if ocean acidity continues to worsen, as a result of the increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, which causes a directly proportional increase in high levels of carbonic acid.
“Healthy seas are a source of extraordinary natural beauty and wonder and also a basis for the functioning of the global economy,” said Louise Heaps, chief marine policy adviser at WWF-UK, who contributed to the report.
“Through overfishing, which damages coastal habitats, and without solving the problem of global warming, we sow the seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe,” says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of published scientific literature as well as the Living Planet Index, a database maintained by the London Zoo Society, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It investigated a wide variety of marine species, from fish, sea turtles and sea cucumbers - a worm-like animal with rough skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that algae areas have declined by about 30 percent over the past century, while total mangrove areas declined by 20 percent between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
Over the course of a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
It takes profound change to ensure abundant ocean life for generations to come,” said Marco Lambertini, Managing Director of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been recorded in the species fished for commercial gain.
For example, 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae family – mackerel, tuna and sardines – declined by 74 percent between 1970 and 2010, with no signs of recovery, the report says.
We are in a fishing race that could end up depriving people of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
“Overfishing, destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities, which rely on the sea, will be hit the fastest and the strongest,” Lambertini said.
“The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and undermine our fight to eradicate poverty and malnutrition,” he said.
Professor Ken Norris, scientific director of ZL, said: “These alarming figures prove how quickly people change plants and animals in the oceans and represent a clear warning about the problems we may face as a result.”
Sea grass: extensive underwater "grasslands", which catch mineral-rich sediments and stabilize the seabed.
Over the past century, the area covered has declined by 30%.
Mangroves are known to exist in 123 countries, with almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most biologically productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of all marine species live in or near coral reefs, but three-quarters of them are currently threatened and many may disappear during this century if the ocean’s acidity continues to worsen.
Deepwater habitats: Very little is known about deeper ocean areas, but the decline in the amount of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the past 40 years suggests they are also affected by global marine changes.
Steven Gerrard denies allegations of racism against former Liverpool teammate El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography in the work "My Story", serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalese player saying that "he is not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague he liked "the least" in his 17 years at the club.
As a citizen, Diouf would have responded to Gerrard on Senegalese radio station Groupe Futurs Medias, with translated quotes attributed to the attacker, who would have said that Gerrard "never liked people of color".
Gerrard’s lawyers denied any accusations of racism against him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who had previously made his bad opinion about Diouf public, criticized his former colleague’s attitude and degree of professionalism.
“I don’t want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his wasted seasons in Liverpool as an example of how I can go it alone,” he wrote.
"It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and he does not care about Liverpool at all."
For example, the way he spit out a huge, viscous phlegm in a Celtic fan at a Parkhead UEFA Cup match in March 2003 is evidence of his scornful, rancorous behavior.
Diouf proved to be a controversial figure throughout his time on Anfield, his most notorious night being at Celtic Park.
The Senegalese foreman was questioned by police after the spitting episode and fined his two-week salary at the club, the sum of 60,000 pounds being donated to a humanitarian organization at Celtic's choosing.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
“His attitude was completely wrong,” Gerrard wrote at the time.
I felt that he wasn’t exactly willing to make every effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at the Malaysian club Sabah, in turn publicly criticized Gerrard and attacked Gerrard’s old friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerrard "egoist" and claimed that no one on Anfield liked the player who led the team to victory in the Champions League in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "jealous".
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn’t get the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the status of chief, and he lives there.
I am respected in the world of football, the greatest football experts have placed me among the top seven players in the World Championship and among the top 100 players of the century.
Many big players don’t have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I go to other countries, I am revered, while Gerrard is hushed every time he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From hero to professional dancer: Alek Skarlatos' quick road to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of Dancing With the Stars, Alek Skarlatos isn’t just playing the hero in the uniform.
He is also a young, attractive and athletic guy, equally discreet and modern, the manufacturers say.
“It’s a lot of categories and we’re always looking for the most popular one of the moment,” said Deena Katz, executive co-producer of ABC.
I swear they'll find an agent after that.
It's charming.
She's got something special.
Before being a contestant at the famous show - but only a few weeks before - Skarlatos reached the international press after taking action in the face of great danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized a man armed with an AK-47 in a train full of travelers traveling from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three of them stopped what could have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
After that, 22-year-old Skarlatos, sentry in the National Army, who grew up near Sacramento, received a phone call from President Obama, a Twitter message from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the U.S. military and the French government.
Although he may have anticipated some local acclaim – Friday in Sacramento, a parade was held in honor of the young man – he did not expect so many positive reactions or invitations to attend “Dancing With the Stars”.
“I wouldn’t have thought in a million years that I’d get this offer,” Skarlatos said Saturday during a break from rehearsals with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy.
Even though before Monday night’s show he admitted he was “slightly excited,” he performed like a professional on his first foxtrot, scoring points that brought him almost to the forefront of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said she offered one of the best performances of the evening.
Katz and "DWTS" executive producer Rob Wade said they wanted to keep an open spot in the show for invited competitors on the last hundred meters, as is the case of Skarlatos, who have grown in the public eye.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation, who thwarted a gun attack on a train with 500 passengers and immediately thought about inviting one of them to the dance contest.
He searched social media, found family members and texted Skarlatos.
When he appeared on Good Morning America to recount the incident in which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the ABC sister program to avoid going through all the media dams.
He supported his "five-minute bounty", then looked forward to finding out if Skarlatos would agree to participate in "DWTS".
“For a while everything was very uncertain, because that’s so different from what he does,” Katz said.
A short time ago he was fighting in Afghanistan, and now I was asking him if he had a taste for dancing.
Skarlatos, who is on a short leave from the National Guard, had not even seen an entire show until recently.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn’t want to be just highlighted.
The show could not invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace in their sleeves: Noah Galloway, a war veteran, with his hand and foot amputated.
They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, the fan favorite and finalist of last season, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably the tipping point, along with Katz’s relentless “following” and “insisting messages,” she said.
“Noah is a great guy and I wanted to know how the army will look and how my friends’ image will be protected,” Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
After that conversation, I agreed.
Skarlatos, a great lover of sport and history, had never danced before, and Arnold confessed in interviews that he was trying to make him relax and give up his rather rigid military posture.
But Katz says she is confident that she will adapt and that viewers will react positively.
He’ll get a lot of love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he’s done.
“How can you not support him?” said Katz.
But that will only take a few weeks.
To move forward, you have to dance.
Skarlatos, who is a bachelor and wants to become a cop, says that, until now, he has had fun in this environment completely unknown to him.
The show was the hardest fight, having to travel frequently to Los Angeles between media acclaim and various awards ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the United States immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with his family.
“It took about a day and a half,” he said.
Overall, I stayed home for four days.
There is a risk in grabbing a person who attracts media attention but is not used to being in the spotlight, executive producer Wade said.
And the show wants to make sure the competitor gets along and has fun.
“The pressure is high and we want the participants to have a pleasant experience,” Wade said.
“Wouldn’t Alek ever want to say, ‘Auleu, what did I get myself into?’
Let's keep his fists amused.
McRib of McDonald's is back.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-ribs to enjoy.
Is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of McDonald’s franchises in the country offer this seasonal specialty.
Last year, 75% of restaurants served McRib sandwiches.
“The 2015 McRib promotion involves about 8,000 restaurants,” McDonald’s spokeswoman Lisa McComb told The Times in an email.
In the US there are just over 14,300 restaurants of this fast food.
However, according to McComb, the individual owners of the franchise decide whether or not to serve McRib.
“Participation is not significantly different from last year,” McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu that their local customers think they want.
And if you’re still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald’s tried to explain its ingredients last year, with a video showing the reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwiches are made from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year at participating McDonald’s restaurants.
There is also a website with locations serving McRib (unaffiliated with McDonald's) that may be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search for the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the nearest McRib restaurant in Los Angeles is in Sevastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can’t fight the appetite for BBQ chicken pizza.
Keith Richards announces new Rolling Stones recordings
Keith Richards is once again in the spotlight with a new solo album and a documentary appearance, but soon the other members of the Rolling Stones may also join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others at the Stones – Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood – met recently in London and made “clear recording plans,” he says.
On Tuesday night, Richards spoke to reporter Jim Kerr as part of the iHeartRadio ICONS series.
A possible new album from the Stones would be the band's first LP after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the band was not inactive at all.
In recent years they have had many stadium tours and performed in several small concerts in L.A., including performances at the Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
In the latter, they reinterpreted the 1971 classic LP, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was busy this year, collaborating on the documentary "Keith Richards: Under the Influence", scheduled to be released on September 18 on Netflix.
This year, he released his third solo album, Crosseyed Heart, in his five-decade career.
Randy Lewis of The Times described Richards' new album in an earlier interview with the guitarist: "As always, Richards' harsh voice is a rather kind than distinguished instrument."
But Richards excites all 15 songs on the album and that’s always meant rock ‘n’ roll.
In the interview, Richards says the band will most likely enter the studio after the South American tour early next year.
He gave no further details, but judging by the last concerts, the band is still very lively.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman on Childhood, Maturity and “The Family Fang”
Jason Bateman has already gone through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them seem much simpler than they actually were.
Once a child actor in television shows such as "Silver Spoons", as an adult he reasserted himself as an inexpressive typicalist in the television series "Crisis Situation" and in films as "nightmare bosses".
The first film he worked on as a director was the very acid comedy “Bad Words,” in which he also starred.
The film was nominated at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adapted from the 2011 popular novel by Kevin Wilson. The screenplay is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film plays Nicole Kidman and Bateman, as the troubled brothers.
The film is about a festival seeking American distribution.
Many reviews of the book have considered it a comedy with strong emotional tents; the film reinterprets the story, placing more emphasis on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview with our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says that he always considered the book more of a drama than a comedy.
“I’ve never seen the book of life,” he confessed.
In the book, the subject and themes are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin approached a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The world premiere on Monday evening benefited from an introduction by the festival’s program director, Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm especially for the late 1980s and early 1990s sitcom “The Hogan Family,” which Bateman worked on.
However, the few episodes he directed from that sitcom brought Bateman, now 46, to the Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new film centers on a family named Fang.
His parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are medium-sized artists best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their shows, for example by plotting a bank robbery with candy canes or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
As they mature, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) struggle to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she is famous for public scandals rather than performance, and Baxter is a novelist and magazine journalist trying to become famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear under mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter suspect it's just another trick of theirs and try to uncover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don’t think it’s hard to see what in the story of the child actors who want to evolve into adult life was reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
“My childhood was very atypical,” Bateman says.
I started acting when I was 10, all of us as managers, and this film has a lot of elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn’t see the story as superficial and fun.
“It’s a story that I feel connected to and understand deeply,” he added, “although I didn’t try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly what this film must look like to represent children with an untraditional childhood.”
The project began with Kidman, the film's producer, who obtained the rights to Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write the adaptation himself, he was co-opted Lindsay-Abaire, who adapted his own song "Awakening to Reality", in which he played Kidman.
Bateman confesses that he accepted the chance to direct the film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in the production of "Photograph 51", did not attend Monday's premiere.
The author of the book was in public.)
In the Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman’s film “a clever and caustic adaptation” that “types the clichés of the much overexploited genre of dysfunctional family and dissects the sometimes life-threatening mission of children to understand their parents in ways that can be funny and bittersweet, incisive and usually very intense.”
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very harsh portrait" and noted that Bateman "shows visible progress and greater maturity as a film director with this intelligently structured adaptation, but never too stringed or mechanical."
After Monday’s screening, when Bateman and Walken took the stage for the questioning session, the audience lauded beloved Walken for a long time.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the questioning session that “He impressed me every day.
I couldn’t believe the ease with which the work of director of the film, which is very difficult, and that of actor in the scenes, changed between them.
His focus is, indeed, amazing.
In a certain dialogue scene, Bateman sits on a staircase in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the dark, just a shadow in the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and can be seen more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor talking to Bateman the director about the fact that he can't be seen.
“I find it incredibly interesting to direct movies,” Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never make them to benefit myself as an actor.
To have the privileged position of being the one responsible for creating the whole experience for the audience, not just a single instrument in that orchestra, to be an actor, is a complete thing.
It doesn’t matter that the actor wants a close-up.
During the question-and-answer session, Bateman confessed that after reading the script, he immediately thought of Walken for the role of Caleb, as well as the composer Carter Burwell for the soundtrack.
Primarily known for his long friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell also composed the soundtrack for two other films at the Toronto festival: the animated film "Anomalisa" - a love story and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legendary Gangsters", Brian Helgeland's 1960 interpretation of the twins of the English Gangsters.
Burwell also composed the soundtrack for Todd Haynes' "Carol".
“Things with elongated or dull tones seem very interesting to me,” Bateman says, giving more explanations Tuesday.
Navigate through those tones and guide your audience harmoniously and somewhat elegantly from one to the next throughout the film.
Carter has built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate through the most complicated tones.
With “The Family Fang,” Bateman took another bold step, both as a director and as an actor, into a career dominated by reinvention and determination, a mix of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
As Bateman confessed when he finished his introduction to the film at the world premiere on Monday, “Well, bad, it felt exactly the way I wanted it to.”

Did you win $240,000 in the lottery?
A ticket to X-LOTTO worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for one month.
The unregistered ticket to the X-Lotto draw was purchased from the Ingle Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd on Saturday, August 15.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, there were 16 other winning entries across Australia, which shared the X-Lotto’s estimated $4 million single prize fund.
SA Lotteries asks everyone who bought tickets to X-Lotto from Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them out as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the X-Lotto 3555 draw on Saturday, August 15, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, manager of Ingle Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says she is looking forward to the good news that the winner of the grand prize has checked his ticket to the X-Lotto.
“We tried very hard to spread the news, because one person is our winner and has no idea,” she said.
Forensic detectives search the house on Beadell Street in Burton, where missing Daniel Hind was last seen.
Hind’s sister, Chelsea Hind, said it was frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially as police offered two different versions of his journey the night he was last seen.
Her family had asked the police to search the house since her brother’s disappearance.
“We were hoping they would search the house, we weren’t informed that they would,” she said.
Ms. Hind also says that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
“We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night,” she said.
We're four kids and we have many other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Anyway, we want him home and let's put an end to the story.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometers of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometers of new highways and repair 17,000 kilometers of existing main and secondary roads.
Completion of the works for the Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all part of the pan-European transport corridors, is among the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure greater road safety and efficient management of road transport, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the trafficking of cultural goods in Syria.
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for the illicit trafficking of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East due to its geographical location.
During a speech on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the theft of Syria’s cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria’s national legislation has been redone to fit the new context, emphasizing a ban on cross-border trade from Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian News Agency (BTA), said the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of the Interior, in particular of the Directorate-General for “Combating Organized Crime” (GDBOP) focused on preventing smuggling and illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed third, after Italy and Greece, among the top traffickers of cultural objects and goods.
Bulgaria’s interior minister also said the trafficking of cultural objects and the destruction of historic sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria was a growing phenomenon, described as an extremely serious war crime.
He insisted that concerted and decisive measures are needed to stop the deliberate destruction of history.
UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova said footage of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria showed that the country was affected by the industrial robbery.
Participants at Wednesday’s conference acknowledged that Syria’s cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must unite to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods in the war-torn country.
Aerojet Rocketdyne Says Program for New AR-1 Engine Could Be Modified
On Tuesday, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc said it expects to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019, to replace a Russian engine that will soon be banned, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funding from the US government.
Aerojet Vice President Julie Van Kleeck has declined to comment that Aerojet has offered $2 billion to buy United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint-stock company for missile launches by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say the bid is a strategic move by Aerojet to beat rival Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, who is developing a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan missile.
The ULA says Blue Origin's engine program is about two years ahead of Aerojet's AR-1 engine, a claim Aerojet contradicts.
Work on the new engines became a priority after U.S. lawmakers approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for U.S. military or spy satellite launches after Russia annexed Crimea last year.
Van Kleeck says Aerojet is testing engine hardware, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to fit in both the ULA’s Atlas 5 rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and the new Vulcan rocket developed by the ULA and costing about $1 billion.
Aerojet says it will be less expensive and less risky to integrate its engine into the Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a completely new engine and rocket, as the ULA currently plans.
Van Kleeck says Aerojet was planning to start large-scale engine testing in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be postponed if the company does not receive enough funding from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first semester of fiscal 2016, which begins in October.
She also said the entire company was looking forward to seeing how the Air Force would share about $160 million in funding between rival competitors.
It also says Aerojet was considering trying other private financing options for the engine, but did not provide details.
Air Force competition is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide one-third of the funding, and the Air Force covers two-thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both private companies, have self-funded their engine creation process and say they don’t necessarily seek funding from the government.
AB InBev plans $275 billion merger with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world’s largest brewer, has approached rival SABMiller (SAB.L) about a takeover that would form a colossus that would produce a third of the world’s total beer.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately USD 275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev’ dominance in Latin America with SABMiller’s in Africa, both representing fast-growing markets, but also with their Asian breweries.
“The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also some places in Asia and Latin America,” said Andrew Holland, an analyst at Societe Generale.
AB InBev and other top beer companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weaknesses in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirits.
SABMiller, the world’s second-largest beer company and the maker of more than 200 brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that it had been informed of AB InBev’s intention to make an offer to it, which must happen by 14 October, according to British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private equity fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its cost-cutting marketing policy, previously orchestrated the acquisition of Burger King, ketchup maker Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A source close to SAB said it was too early to say what he would do as they received no offers.
“Right now, we’re in the waiting and deciding phase,” the source said.
Speculation about a merger, which would most likely raise concerns about violating competition rules in markets such as the United States and China, has been circulating for several years.
The momentum of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions by AB InBev, follows a decrease of about 15% in the price of SABMiller shares since August.
“This is exactly the moment they were waiting for,” said Morningstar analyst Phil Gorham.
Financially, for the first time in seven years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds ($62) per SAB Miller share, perhaps even 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to $130 billion, which would also include SABMiller’s debt.
This would make it the most significant M&A transaction of 2015, already announcing a record year after the 2008 financial crisis in terms of the transaction amount, and one of the largest acquisitions since 1980.
SAB shares approached 19.9% at 36.14 pounds, giving it a market capitalization of $90 billion.
AB InBev shares reached 6.4%.
Rivals Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB might seek another fusion as a defense strategy, as it did the previous year when it offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, it has combined its African bottle of soft drinks with that of Coca-Cola (KO.N), and in recent weeks there has been a suspicion of a combination with Diageo or the Australian beverage company Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
AB InBev’s global share of the beer market, producer Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to industry experts Plato Logic.
AB InBev intends a ratio between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) of 2 times, from the current 2.5.
It is possible to reach the target in 2016, the realistic date that the transaction could end, so it would have to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought Budweiser’s manufacturing company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 for $52 billion, the largest cash purchase in history at the time.
A rise as high would allow him to accrue a debt of 100 billion.
The families that control AB InBev own just over half of the company, while the two main shareholders at SABMiller are cigarette maker Altria (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Altria declined to give statements about being approached by AB InBev, but on September 9, its chief financial officer, Billy Gifford, said at an analysis conference that he regularly evaluates the investment in SABMiller and that “this time we believe that maintaining assets is in the interest of our shareholders.”
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for the statement.
Neil Dwane, chief European equity investor at Allianz Global Investors, which owns shares in both companies, says AB InBev has faced mounting pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of income from small debts reaches somewhere around 15%.
But we think the profit from this acquisition would be a disappointing 8 percent after 10 years,” Dwane said.
In the case of any combination there are significant weights related to breaches of competition rules, especially in the United States, where companies own about 70% of the beer market.
“The savings that could be made from distribution operations are large, and the barriers to violating competition rules are even greater,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 percent shareholding held by SABMiller under the operating agreement governing it.
A change of control to SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to get another 8 percent and appoint a new CEO of the company.
Molson, based in Denver, would be entitled to the first and last bid for the remaining 50 percent.
A spokesman for Molson declined to comment on whether the company is interested in an auction, but Molson shares rose more than 12 percent to their highest value.
Any merger may also need to sell shares in China, where the market leader is SABMiller’s joint venture CR Snow with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao in China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that, after the divestments, the combined group could hold 28% of the global market.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is advised by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani Police Accuse Former Air Force Pilot of Helping Al Qaeda
Pakistani police have arrested a former Air Force pilot who is said to have donated funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, police officers told Reuters on Wednesday, in a rare case targeting those who help finance activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
He paid for the treatment of injured Taliban militants at a hospital in the eastern city of Lahore, police said.
It also influenced two militants involved in an attack on a bus in May with members of the Ismaili Shiite Muslim minority, resulting in the deaths of 45 people, Naveed Khawaja, a senior police officer at the province’s Counter Terrorism Department, told reporters.
He will be charged with financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
“Ahmed has also funded the Afghan Taliban, we are still conducting investigations to see if he has provided financial aid through his business or behind him is someone else,” the official said.
“Ahmed also offered financial aid to AQIS,” he said, referring to the Al Qaeda organization on the Indian Subcontinent, an al Qaeda branch founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces facing activism, corruption and crime.
After Taliban gunmen massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school in December, the government vowed to quell activism.
Hard attacks took place, while the army also advanced further into off-law tribal regions on the border with Afghanistan.
But militant groups remain a threat and many have followers in Pakistani cities that are under the control of poorly prepared and underfunded police forces.
Ahmed, 52, used to preach at a mosque in the Karachi Army Housing Authority.
His public preaching was moderate, but in particular, he encouraged radicalism, police said.
He studied at the Pakistan Air Force College in the city of Sargodha and left the Pakistan Air Force in 1998, another security official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
He subsequently entered the paint and chemical industry.
Rapper Rick Ross has been denied a copyright application for “Everyday I’m Hustlin.”
New York rapper Rick Ross cannot claim his copyright for the words “Everyday I’m hustlin,” a U.S. judge ruled, rejecting his claim against LMFAO, which sold T-shirts with a similar line, “Everyday I’m shufflin.”
In a decision released Tuesday by the federal Miami court, District Judge Kathleen Williams said Ross’s slogan, a prominent part of her 2006 debut hit “Hustlin,” is an abbreviated expression for which the courts have repeatedly mentioned that she cannot receive copyright.
Williams’ court ruling weakens the copyright infringement lawsuit that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, filed against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the Los Angeles-based electropop duet, consisting of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin" for their own famous 2010 song, "Party Rock Anthem," which contains the song "Everyday I'm Shufflin."
The hip hop star said the LMFAO song is "an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of Hustlin'."
He also sued Kia Motors for using the song "Party Rock Anthem" in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross alleged that LMFAO infringed his copyright by selling t-shirts and other products with the slogan shufflin.
In Tuesday’s court ruling, Williams says that “Hustlin” as a song is protected by copyright law.
But Ross’s three-word slogan is made up of ordinary words and can’t have copyright, she said.
The judge compared it to other famous lyrics from the past, such as “you got the right one, uh-huh,” “holla back,” and “we get it poppin,” saying it was “a brief expression, which all courts unanimously declared impossible to place under copyright.”
The judge did not decide whether the LMFAO's song was an unauthorized copy of "Huslin."
The trial is scheduled for October.
Ross' lawyers and LMFAO could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District, Florida, Nr.

Dr. Carson Approaches Trump in Latest Republican Party Presidential Poll
According to the latest presidential poll for 2016, novice politician Ben Carson is approaching bombastic leader Donald Trump in the Republican preliminary election.
Carson scored 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped in polls by seven points.
After 27% of Trump’s support in the most recent CBS/New York Times poll, Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, comes in second by 23%, followed by Bush, TV star Mike Huckabee, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, each by 6%.
Support from Republican voters in the preliminary election increased from early August to early September for Trump, Carson, Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.
Support for the latter two remains, however, at single-digit numbers.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and the one who carries the Bush family standards forward, fell seven percentage points in a month, while Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker fell eight points.
In the latest poll, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson has garnered more support than Trump among college graduates (29% vs. 21%), while Trump is ahead of Carson in voter preferences without a college degree (30% vs. 19%).
Trump is supported more by men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents said they were determined which candidate to support in their state’s pre-elections.
Those who have said that and with whom they will vote support Trump twice as much as Carson.
It is still too early to say for 63% of Republican voters in the pre-elections.
The results of the September 9-13 CBS/NYT poll will be released on Tuesday ahead of a Republican presidential debate.
Carson’s rise in this poll reflects that of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in front of the Democratic presidential nominee leader, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The latest follow-up to the CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders rose 10 points and 22 points in Iowa and New Hampshire, respectively, among Democratic voters for the preliminaries.
Ethical Expert Says Sex Robots Should Be Banned
A leading ethicist in the robotics industry has launched a campaign calling for a ban on the development of sex robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, a robotics expert at De Montfort University in Leicester, England, warns that sex robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
“Sex robots seem to be an increasingly important subject in the robotics industry, and the models they are inspired by – how they will look, what roles they will play – are very disturbing,” she told the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sex robots is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
It is inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires the development of technology,” she told the Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will help increase the degree of sexual exploitation.
Although the sex robots that are now being manufactured are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they represent the first step towards something more sinister.
It’s a new and emerging technology, but we need to stop it.
The industry seems to be gaining momentum.
A few years ago, the True Companion inflatable doll maker launched Roxxxy, “the world’s first sex robot.”
But worrying about the possible dangers posed by artificial intelligence is not uncommon, even among large industry representatives.
This spring, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk wrote about “the risk of something really dangerous happening in five years.
In an interview with the BBC last December, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that “the development of complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race.”
UK welcomes first refugees from Syria - RT UK
In the coming days, Britain will welcome the first refugees to flee the Syrian war, Interior Minister Theresa May said.
They will receive assistance under the government’s expanded resettlement program.
Refugees seeking asylum arrive from camps on the border with the war-torn country.
They are the first of the 20,000 refugees the UK plans to take in by 2020.
In a speech to the House of Commons, the interior minister said the government was "working fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the UK, it is imperative that they already have the assistance and support they need and deserve.
I know that honorable members and the general public want to know more about the number of people and the date they are expected to arrive.
May noted that the government needs to make even more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate supplies when they arrive.
I have to point out that the level of expansion requires careful and meticulous planning to ensure that everything goes smoothly.
I and the Syrian refugee minister, Richard Harrington, will continue to keep the House up to date on this matter.
But I am pleased to tell the House that we expect to welcome the first wave of refugees in the days ahead and are working quickly to plan more arrivals in the weeks ahead.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew anger from lawmakers and activists when he unveiled the government’s refugee plan, which he said was too small.
In September, Cameron said in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom would “raise to the height of its moral responsibility” and would welcome 20,000 refugees from Middle East camps until the next general election.
He added that refugees would not automatically receive full asylum, but a humanitarian status that would allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics noted that the figures only meant 12 refugees a day, and former liberal Democrat Paddy Ashdown said the measures were “desire.”
Ashdown said the children are to be deported when they turn 18 if they do not receive asylum.
Stars and prominent public figures also condemned the measures.
In a joint letter, big names like Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the response to the crisis is “too little, too late.”
“It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbors, not simply thrown on the shoulders of countries close to the conflicts that drive people out of their homes,” they wrote.
Ruble recovers amid global insecurity - RT Business
The Russian ruble strengthened on Wednesday, trading 65.66 against the US dollar and 73.98 against the euro on the Moscow Stock Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
Overall, the Russian currency earned seven percentage points from its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar on August 24.
Analysts say the ruble’s return came as investors reacted to current global market turmoil caused by China’s hardships, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s possible rate hike, and overreacting to cheap oil.
Brent prices rose by 61 cents on Wednesday to $48.36 per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, at $45.31 per barrel.

“It’s possible that volatility is taking its toll, fueled by uncertainty about China and the timing of the federal rate hike, which will continue to set the tone for oil prices and the ruble,” Piotr Matys of London-based Rabobank told Bloomberg.
Experts also point to another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, began to buy rubles.
Global markets are awaiting Thursday’s Federal Reserve decision whether or not the interest rate will rise.
Markets believe it will not happen what could represent the first increase in nine years of the U.S. interest rate and traded at higher rates on Wednesday.
NASA and the UK work together on drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the U.S. government and companies such as Google, Amazon and the Verizon phone company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
The collaboration comes as a result of widespread unrest over the possibility of an aerial collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes in vivid colors the potential negative effect.
“Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capturing data in high-density urban areas such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco.”
Without a common set of technological protocols and overhead rules, chaos could be installed.
According to Detta O'Cathain, baroness of the House of Lords, the concern has been heightened amid reports of events at the edge of an accident and drone operations above football stadiums, near nuclear power plants and the Eiffel Tower.
“Over the past two years, more than 400 calls to metropolitan police have been linked to drone incidents,” O’Cathain said.
What is the solution: building a system that tracks all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 meters, whether they are driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
“As more and more small drones perform commercial flights at low altitudes, beyond the pilot’s visibility level, or even fully autonomous flights, some air traffic management infrastructure is needed to separate flights in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, for example delivery of parcels to cities,” she said.
According to NASA, this drone traffic management system will include services such as airspace design, methods of avoiding unfavorable weather and wind, congestion management, route planning and redirection by methods similar to the established rules for road traffic, such as traffic signals and lanes.
They expect to have a working prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is set to explode in the European Union in the coming years.
“We already see small and innovative SME companies in the UK using this technology with considerable effects in the energy, agriculture and media industries,” says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 permits for commercial drone operations were granted in the UK alone by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150,000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
The Dislike Button: Why Facebook Wants to Know What Hurts You
“A Look Back” works similarly, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will that mean for the multitudes of users within Facebook’s virtual borders, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, an empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
Facebook’s huge value – about $240 billion after the latest statistic – is due to the unimaginable amount of consumer data it holds.
Every interaction, post, appreciation, and friendship you make is gathered and builds a remarkably complex picture, constantly updated, of yourself and your preferences.
This is valuable primarily for advertisers, who can use all this information to carefully choose which people to see their ads on Facebook, selecting those who are most interested in their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and certainly opens a door for another type of advertisers to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who “appreciate” a national football team, charities and promoters want to address those who, for example, “empathize” with the refugee crisis.
It will also likely change what you see in the News.
Facebook uses incredibly clever and sophisticated algorithms to narrow down that huge universe of content you might see, in the smaller stream you actually see.
This algorithm essentially depends on what you’ve found interesting in the past and especially what you’ve liked.
Undoubtedly, there is fear on Facebook that many interesting but unfortunate posts don’t get into the algorithm, because people don’t feel like they should appreciate them.
But if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it could make the decision to remove these kinds of posts from News.
Facebook has conducted experiments in the past to understand how what you see on News affects your emotional state and, more importantly, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
Representatives of academia call this “emotional contamination,” and while it sounds sinister, it’s probably just a simple attempt by Facebook (and published openly, with their consent) to better understand how their platform works and whether they can adjust algorithms to distribute more elements.
What happens with the empathy button is up to Facebook.
The really striking thing is how a single company’s decision to add a single button to its services can produce so much speculation.
The reason this happens may be that Facebook’s decisions – whether it involves the visible buttons we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden – have profound consequences for us today.
Now we spend a significant part of our life in the digital world, which we access to find anything from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and one that is constantly fighting for survival in the fierce Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
The decisions he makes, including with regard to new buttons, will be those considered the most suitable to stay on the surface in this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with this and they will soon have a button for it.
Biometric bracelets can predict seizures in people with autism
Over the course of ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have determined that body signals can predict these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, thus giving assistants the opportunity to take appropriate action.
The children with autism we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say that his head hurts or that "there's too much noise here" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body is transmitting to us. And it is necessary to do this in a gentle and non-intrusive way.
For example, simply visualizing colors in an app can show the level of agitation. Red can be used to warn about a change in behavior, and blue for lack of interest, giving life to the assistant that the person is bored and needs stimulation.
The data from the bracelets can be collected over time and saved on a secure server, helping caregivers understand the overall picture of how the person responds to various situations and what would be the most appropriate intervention.
I must say very clearly that we do not read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magical. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with manufacturers to further develop this technology to be autism-specific.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, director of customer services at the Wirral Autistic Society, who will present the technology at the 2015 Autech conference on autism and technology in Manchester on October 1.
When you work with people who are suffering from severe autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference it can make in their quality of life. Now, iPad apps really give a voice to people who have never spoken.
Robots help autistic children learn to play hide-and-seek.
“Who knows where this innovation could take us,” she says.
Assistive technologies can truly change life and we feel that they are part of our mission as an autism charity to ensure that everyone has access to this information and are also part of the debate on how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack ISIS in Syria "in the coming weeks"
In the coming weeks, French warplanes will launch airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria, the government announced on Wednesday, just days after President François Hollande had declared the intervention a "necessary" one.
France will carry out the first airstrikes on the Islamic State group in Syria "in the coming weeks", Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.
The French air force has been conducting reconnaissance missions in Syria since September 8, and the attacks will follow “in the coming weeks, as soon as we have clearly identified targets,” Le Drian told France Inter radio station.
Le Drian told parliament on Tuesday that ISIS had made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern Aleppo region.
“A very strong offensive is taking place in the small town of the Sea, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition or what’s left of it,” he said.
France is part of a US-led coalition that has been bombing ISIS positions in Iraq for a year, but Hollande changed his strategy last week to expand action in Syria as political pressure builds amid the jihadist threat facing France.
The United States, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf states have already engaged in attacks on ISIS militants in Syria.
The ad blocking feature in iOS 9 will make your phone even faster
The latest version of iOS 9 launches on Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners – and worrying for online publishers – is the ability to easily block ads while browsing the web.
The new feature will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, ads, pop-ups and other types of advertising while using Apple’s mobile version of the Safari browser.
In tests, it turned out that after the ad blocking, news sites like the New York Times load twice as fast, according to Reuters.
Also, ad blocking helps users keep their data usage and battery life.
Users will benefit from several ad blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal apps.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop ad blocker, has launched its own ad-limiting iOS web browser; its creator plans to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People who use ad blocking software face some constraints.
Advertisements are still displayed in apps (hence Apple earns money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such ad blocking features.
However, the degree of their use on desktop computers has increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development poses major challenges for online media, which is largely offered free of charge to consumers and has been financially supported for many years through advertising.
One report says that blocking ads could cost online publishers nearly $22 billion in ad revenue this year alone.
To enable ad blocking in iOS 9, users need to download an ad blocking app, and then go to Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to enable an extension for content blocking.
Obama Talks About Terrorism and the Immigrant Crisis with Spain’s King
President Barack Obama on Tuesday greeted King Felipe VI of Spain at the White House, where the two discussed topics that may have diminished the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the King have addressed the topic of the fight against the Islamic State and the growing migrant crisis in Europe – already facing hundreds of thousands of people who have left their home country to head west.
“Spain has worked very hard to address this problem in the past, with North African immigrants often involved in very dangerous travel, and the problem of human trafficking,” Obama said.
Of course, the problem has gotten worse in recent months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially as the Spanish territory votes in elections this month.
“In terms of foreign policy, we have firmly committed to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain,” Obama said.
The Supreme Commander also told King Felipe that he would like to visit his country before the end of his term in 2017.
“We welcome you with open arms,” Felipe replied.
First Lady Michelle Obama gave the Queen a tour of the White House and had a tea talk.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States since ascending the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to make a visit to South Florida.
Alfre Woodard joins Luke Cage
Famous actress Alfre Woodard has joined the cast of the upcoming Netflix series Luke Cage from Marvel. She will be the antagonist of Mike Colter, who plays the superhero who gives the title of the series.
Woodard will play Mariah Dillard – “a local Harlem politician and cousin of Cornell “Cottonmouth” Stokes recently announced, played by Mahershala Ali – who intends to bring an era of change to the streets she has grown up,” a press release said.
Her personal life and professional career are overwhelmed by Harlem’s newest hero, Luke Cage, as well as the infamous actions of her cousin, Cottonmouth.
“Alfre has an incredible, unique and intimidating on-screen presence that makes her perfect for the community leadership role in Harlem,” said Jeph Loeb, executive producer and president of Marvel Television.
We are delighted that an actress as famous and talented as Alfre has agreed to join us in this adventure.
The series will premiere in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Coker will write the first two episodes and work as a showrunner and executive producer.
Woodard, 62, is known for the TV series Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, L.A. Law, Desperate Girls and Law Firm, as well as the films Devil's Advocate, Mysterious Obsession, The Family That Preys, 12 Years of Slavery, and Annabelle.
Luke Cage is one of the four Marvel series in the Netflix franchise.
Jessica Jones and Iron Fist will also be airing soon, as well as the second season of Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" premiere on the same day
Fox predicts many positive results ahead of the premieres of two of its most anticipated series: Scream Queens and Empire.
The first season in Queens and the second in the Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels the day after the domestic premiere.
As Variety reports, strategy is a trend applied for high-profile series, as traffic from global social networks guarantees success.
“Hollywood realizes how important it is to harness the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the much talked about shows like Empire and Scream Queens,” Fox International president Hernan Lopez said in a statement.
“We look forward to broadcasting these very exciting series to fans around the world,” Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve daily bring the success of a show to the premiere and throughout its life cycle.
The next season of Empire, featuring celebrities like Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, opens in September.
The new series Scream Queens, starring Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande, will air the next day in September.
Members of the British royal family will participate in the world premiere of the film “Spectre”
Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend the world premiere of their latest James Bond film, “Spectre,” in London next month.
Kensington Palace announced the news on Twitter on Wednesday, designating the premiere as the Royal Film Performance for the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release from the producers, “Spectre” is the third Bond film chosen as the RFP since 1946.
In the past, royal premieres have been selected and "Don't Die Today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year’s event takes place on October 26th at Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charitable one, which will benefit behind-the-scenes employees in the British film and television industry.
The premiere will also feature cast including lead actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Director Sam Mendes and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also walk on the red carpet with members of the royal family.
"Spectre" will air in theaters in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together.
Model Christie Brinkley and musician John Mellencamp were seen having dinner together on Monday, raising the rumor that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met for dinner at the Bowery Hotel in New York City, where photographs surprised cheerful and smiling Brinkley.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing jeans, tenants and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken jeans, coats and boots.
Last October, Mellencamp was reportedly seen again with his girlfriend, Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the star of the Message for you on NBC's Today, saying he was "an angel sent to me and I'm very happy."
He added that “nothing ends until it ends.”
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, posed for Seventeen magazine, following in her mother's footsteps.
Arctic mosquito rounds are big enough to shoot down a karibu
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable due to warmer climates, but global warming has proven beneficial for others.
One of these beneficial species is the Arctic mosquito.
According to researchers at Dartmouth College, warmer temperatures in the Arctic region have allowed mosquitoes here to appear earlier and grow larger, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding in Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their field observations to exemplify the effects of temperature changes on Arctic mosquitoes.
Their analysis anticipates a 50% increase in the survival rate of adult mosquitoes under the conditions of a 2 degree Celsius increase in temperature.
Mosquitoes are small, but they are important members of the Arctic food chain and ecosystem.
The new analysis – detailed in a new paper published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B – aims to help biologists better anticipate how a growing mosquito population could affect the karibu they feed on, the birds and insects they feed on, and the plants they pollinate.
To build their demonstration, Dartmouth scientists combined their field results with the results of laboratory experiments that investigated how temperature influences the insect’s development and predisposition to being hunted by predators.
Although rising temperatures make larger mosquitoes more vulnerable to coleoptera, it also gives them an early start in the spring and makes the development of their larvae faster and more efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
More mosquitoes mean a larger population, but they can only grow to the extent that they can be supported by insect food sources.
The ability of mosquitoes to turn their improved survival rate into an improved reproduction rate depends on their ability to provide their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the baby
Three new studies have found that taking antidepressants in pregnant women has no effect on the neuronal or behavioral development of their children.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have said that depression is an even greater risk for women and their children, so it needs to be treated.
“These studies add to a growing body of evidence regarding the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy,” John Thorp, deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said in a statement.
Although there are some increased risks, so far the evidence seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are higher than those of taking antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the motor development of children whose mothers were treated with SSRIs, analyzing data from 51,404 children from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, researching the effects of using SSRIs to develop motor skills at age 3.
The researchers found that 381 mothers had used SSRIs during pregnancy, and 159 of them had been treated with drugs for an extended period.
Although exposure to SSRIs was associated to some extent with a delay in motor development, the researchers wrote in the study that the association “was not so significant as to attach clinical importance to delay.”
A group of researchers from the University of Adelaide in Australia conducted a data review for 49,000 women in the Danish National Birth Cohort to discover the effects of SSRIs on children’s behavior by age 7.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk for behavioral problems.
In 210 of the children whose mothers had been treated for depression with SSRI, there was no increased risk of behavioral problems, compared to 231 children who were more prone to behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, inattention, and social problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more prone to bleeding after birth if treated with SSRIs.
Analysis of medical data from 30,198 who gave birth at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5%, between 11-16%, if women were treated with SSRIs.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, the researchers reported.
The researchers said that while the study linked SSRIs with increased risk, there are a large number of variables – from medications taken during birth to the limited amount of information researchers have about women’s specific medical conditions – that could have had an effect on bleeding potential.
“It is possible that women who took antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy were those with the most serious stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal bleeding, not antidepressants,” says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, a professor at Adelaide University.
On the basis of this study alone, we do not recommend that women stop taking anti-depressant medications during pregnancy, but that they be closely monitored to minimize the risk of potential bleeding.
Matthew is charged with murder in the murder of Virginia Technical University student
The man charged with the murder of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham was charged with qualified murder in the case of a missing Virginia Technical University student in 2009, authorities said on Tuesday.
The grand jury in Albemarle, Virginia, on Friday indicted Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 33, of Charlottesville, for the murder of Morgan Harrington, officials said.
Matthew is also charged with kidnapping with the intention of rape.
Each indictment receives the maximum life sentence.
Harrington, 20, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the indictment brought relief.
“For the past six years, we’ve been working decisively and unflinchingly for this purpose,” says Gil Harrington, Morgan’s mother.
I’m thrilled to know that when you take someone’s life, you have to bear the consequences for your deed.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominoes of the consequences began to be laid.
Police say there is a forensic link between Harrington, Graham and a 2005 sexual abuse case in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty of the latter and awaits sentencing in this case.
He remains in prison in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew Charged with Qualified Murder in Death of University of Virginia Student
Harrington went to U-Va. on October 17, 2009, with friends, to a Metallica concert.
The group split when Harrington left the John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't get back in.
Last time she was seen trying to take a taxi around 8:30 p.m. in front of the arena.
Harrington was dressed in a black t-shirt with the band Pantera.
After her disappearance, Harrington’s bag and cell phone were found in the arena parking lot.
His family and friends began an extensive search for Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher.
In November 2009, the shirt he wore was found near a string of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated lane, on a farm southwest of Charlottesville.
At the time of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew had worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it is unclear whether that period overlapped with the date on which Harrington disappeared.
Police say a significant advance in the Harrington case was Matthew's arrest in the case of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials familiar with the investigation said these cases are linked by DNA evidence.
Investigators have not released details of the new evidence that prompted them to indict Matthew for Harrington’s murder.
Defense attorney Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in the Graham case, declined to give the statement.
The indictment comes two days after the death of Hannah Graham in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both were young students who disappeared when they arrived safely in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew into a downtown mall near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later after a nationwide search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for qualified murder in the Graham case.
In the first days after Graham's disappearance in Charlottesville last fall, Gil Harrington was a constant presence at rallies and vigils organized for the missing U-Va student.
Harrington says she has endured speculation and media criticism for her daughter that must be silenced by the new charges against Matthew.
"All this time there have been discussions like 'Why did he wear a short skirt?' and 'Do you look for it with a candle?' but these kinds of questions and judgments aren't valid when it's clear that we're dealing with a predator in the tracks of the hunt," Harrington said.
In the Fairfax County case, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault on a young woman in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 at the time of the attack, told the jury that one September night, as she was walking home from the store, a stranger came behind her.
He took her to a greenish area, beat her and squeezed her neck, then sexually assaulted her.
“I thought my end came, that I had to scream all the time,” the woman confessed.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew suddenly ran away, the woman said.
A prosecutor told the jury that Matthew may have been frightened by the headlights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was convicted years later, after DNA tests tied him to this case.
Matthew will receive his sentence in October.
Matthew will be on trial for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.
Morgan's father, Dan Harrington, said he would most likely come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
“At least, today we’ve taken another step,” says Dan Harrington.
Did Jon Snow die or not?
Actor Kit Harington gives us a clue.
Actor Kit Harington gave an important clue to the fate of his character from the Games of Thrones series, Jon Snow, who was killed at the end of season four.
In an interview with Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knows the length of his contract with HBO, according to Digital Spy.
Asked how many more seasons he would appear, he said he could not talk about it.
Let’s just say the show will be part of my life sometime, I’ll probably be in 30 when it’s over.
But one thing's for sure.
“When I leave Games of Thrones, then that’s when I’m going to bury myself in projects with feature films,” he said.
The series returns to small screens in the spring of next year.
Fans of the Games of Thrones unleashed hysteria after the end of season four, when Jon Snow was stabbed and released various theories that he would somehow be brought back to life.
Moreover, the Romanians created an event on Facebook called “Jon Snow’s Gift” 40 days after the end of the season, which attracted more than 36,000 supporters.
Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission took the decision on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the “Economic Competitiveness” and “Environment” programmes, both interrupted at the beginning of April 2015.
According to a statement from the Romanian representative of the European Commission, following this decision, about 120 million euros will be transferred to the Romanian authorities in the immediate following period.
I am pleased to announce the release of these payments and appreciate the efforts made by the Romanian authorities to improve the management and control systems within the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weaknesses and solving problems.
“I express my hope that the measures taken will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future,” said EU Commissioner for Regional Policy Corina Cretu.
"The extremist statements made by Mr. Gianni Pittella are incorrect," he said.
Peter Szijjarto has called on European Socialists to stop the “lying campaign” against Hungary.
Referring to statements made by Harlem Desir, France's secretary of state for European affairs, regarding the fence built by Hungary, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "supports a common European strategy on immigration", but insisted that national borders should be protected.
Romania wants to take the shot at the Rugby World Cup
Romania’s national rugby team is ready for a big surprise at the World Cup that will start in the UK on Friday.
The Steyrs set out to win two Group D victories.
“We want two victories with the teams of Canada and Italy,” said Mihai Macovei, the captain of Romania.
The national "tricolora" is part of Group D at the World Cup in England, along with France, Ireland, Canada and Italy.
Romania’s first match of the 2015 World Cup will be played on September 23, the opponent being France.
The refugee crisis: JAI without a solution
European Council President Donald Tusk said on Thursday he would take a decision on whether to convene a European Union summit on migration in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann called on Tuesday for a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis.
At a joint news conference in Berlin, Merkel said Germany, Austria and Sweden could not manage the refugee crisis alone.
The head of the German government expressed support for Berlin’s recent decision to impose border checks in the face of the massive influx of asylum seekers, noting that the measure is aimed at facilitating the registration of refugees.
Slovakia, which opposes the European Commission's proposal to redistribute refugees among member states on the basis of mandatory quotas, has called for an extraordinary EU summit.
EU interior ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday evening, failed to adopt the new proposal for the emergency redistribution of 120,000 refugees between EU member states, presented on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first item of the plan, represented by the emergency resettlement mechanism, provides for the rapid redistribution of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, new controversial cartoons
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo is once again provoking controversy, after the publication of cartoons mocking the response of predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries affected by wars.
In its most recent issue, the publication has attracted attention again, as well as criticism on social networks, the Reuters news agency writes.
One of the drawings depicts a heartbreaking image of Aylan Kurdi, the drowned Syrian boy whose body landed on one of Turkey’s beaches after a failed attempt by his family to cross the sea by boat from Syria to Greece.
The drawing in Charlie Hebdo shows a child in shorts and a T-shirt, face down on the seashore, next to a billboard that offers two children’s menus at the price of one.
“So close to succeeding” is the message accompanying the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack at the editorial office in Paris in January, is accompanied by the message "Proof that Europe is Christian".
The drawing depicts a character like Jesus walking on the water, while a smaller character wearing shorts with his feet up in the water, the first saying "Christians walk on the water", takes the second "Muslim children drown".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression after it was targeted by Islamist militants in January following repeated threats following the mockery of the Prophet Muhammad.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, drastically fined in Russia
French supermarket chain Auchan has been fined more than $370,000 by Russian officials for food safety violations.
Anna Popova, head of Russia’s consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor, said the fines total more than 25 million rubles, or $372,000, according to the Associated Press.
However, the reasons for the fines have not been stated, and Auchan has not commented.
The French supermarket chain is also the target of accusations by the Russian agricultural agency, which claims that some meat products have been found to be infested with bacteria such as E. coli and Listeria.
The food checks come at a time of tension between France and Russia over the extension of EU sanctions and France’s decision to cancel a deal on the supply of Mistral ships to Russia.
The Romanian Foreign Ministry reacted to the news that Hungary could erect a metal fence on the border with our country.
The MAE shows that it has been briefed on this decision and that it is not a politically correct gesture.
MAE said in a statement to Newspapers.com that it had been informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of this intention shortly before it was publicly announced.
In turn, the MAE has informed, in a timely manner, the competent decision-makers in Romania about this situation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that the raising of a fence between two EU member states and which are strategic partners is not a politically correct gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian side, the statement said.
Hungary is making plans to build a metal fence on a segment of the border with Romania in the context of the migrant crisis, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Tuesday.
"The measure is necessary for human traffickers transiting Serbia to change their routes, with the likelihood of moving to Romania," he said.
“The guard would start from the point of the border between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the migration pressure moves to Romania,” Szijjarto said.
In late August, the press reported that non-EU migrants transiting Serbian territory on their way to the European Union were trying to bypass the fence built by the Hungarian authorities at its eastern end, on the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, non-EU immigrants have discovered that they can bypass the fence in the area of Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Hungarian government has allocated 22.2 billion forints (€71.8 million) for the construction of a controversial metal fence on the 175-kilometre border with Serbia, and for the special centers needed to house migrants.
The fence initiative is criticized by the European Union and Serbia.
No need, he'll stay there
The coffin with the dead body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor will not be deposited in the Romanian Senate, despite the wish expressed by the politician’s widow.
According to a press release sent to newspaper.com, the Permanent Senate Office discussed, on Tuesday, a request by Doina Vadim Tudor, on the approval of the filing of the dead body of the former Senator Cornelius Vadim Tudor in the Senate headquarters.
“From the receipt of this letter until the moment of analysis, in the Permanent Office, the body has already been deposited at a place of worship and will remain there, the Permanent Office appreciating that it no longer needs to be moved from there to the Senate of Romania,” the Senate said.
Senator Teodor Atanasiu said the request "is not in line with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe."
The senators also held a moment of silence in memory of the former PRM leader, at the proposal of UNPR Senator Serban Mihailescu.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died at around 6:30 p.m. on Monday night.
The PRM president passed into office at the Army Cardiovascular Disease Emergency Clinic.
The MEP will be buried Thursday at 12:00 at Ghencea Cemetery, and will receive military honors.
Are refugees coming to Romania?
The mayors of the border towns, questioned about the places of accommodation
The mayors of the border towns of Arad County are being questioned by the Police and Border Police, these days, about the places of accommodation for any refugees who may arrive in Romania, but also for gendarmes, if they are mobilized at the border.
The head of the city of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on the subject.
Discussions were also held with farmers in the area, who were asked to report on the presence of any foreigners near the border.
We had discussions with the border police, the national police and the local police, but also with the farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
“We have asked farmers, who have jobs in this period on the arable land, to be careful and to report any movement,” he said.
Immigrant crisis boils in Hungary: Armored and water cannons at the border
He, like other mayors in the border area with Hungary, said police had asked for information on available accommodation in the event of a wave of refugees.
We were asked how many people we could accommodate.
There are no places for refugees in the commune.
We believe that such special centers do not even have to appear at the border, because they are harder to control here, as migrants are tempted to flee, because they are not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be best to set up such centres in areas further away from the border,” Iratosu mayor Papp Attila Joseph said.
The Dorobanti mayor, Vincentiu Almasi, said he was asked about accommodation for refugees and intervention forces if they were to be mobilized in the area.
The police wondered if we could accommodate and gendarmes.
We could find places on the Cultural Road, but for refugees we have no possibility of accommodation.
“We have been asked about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan,” said Vincentiu Almasi.
He added that at the local police station, “since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, it has been permanently established.”
“There’s always a policeman at the station, and the locals know they have to tell if they notice any strangers in the area,” he said.
The representatives of Pilu City Hall said that they can accommodate up to a hundred people, at the Cultural Way, the information being provided to the policemen at their request.
Also, the mayor of Curtici, Nicolae Aanitii, said that there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of the local public finances, but here arrangements are needed.
A former Border Police barracks could also be set up to house refugees.
Representatives of the Arad County Police Press Office did not offer a point of view on the questioning of mayors during this period, only confirming that "in the border towns of Arad County patrol activities have been intensified".
Army Club Commander Announces Radical Measures Against Becali's Star
The commander of the Army Sports Club, Colonel George Boroi, announces a series of radical measures that will be taken against the Star of Gigi Becali.
Although the two sides have negotiated a reconciliation, Boroi argues that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historical record of the "red-blues".
The team that won the Champions Cup is currently on pause.
“It’s not a historic break, it’s just a competitive break, because we don’t have the team, but things can change from next year,” Boroi told Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announced that the process of claiming damages from Becali's team would continue.
The period referred to in the ICCJ decision is very clear.
We need to recover the damage from FC Steaua, the team that used the Steaua brand without the owner's consent - that is, CSA Steaua.
The continuity of the section, which was in fact permanent of the Army club, also appears very clearly.
“So the football team Stara Bucharest, in one form or another, but in a legal form, must exist as a continuation of the performances that it has so far in the records,” says George Boroi.
Becali's star and Army Club have been in open war since late last year, when the Supreme Court decided that the military is the one who owns the "Star" brand.
Simona Halep injured at U.S. Open: First statement of romance
Simona Halep was injured at the U.S. Open, as even the world’s second-largest player admitted on Wednesday.
The number two WTA revealed that he had suffered a muscle strain, and at this point he is undergoing specialized treatment.
I have suffered a small stretch and are undergoing treatment.
"I hope to get back to you as soon as possible," Halep told a news conference.
Simona Halep has evolved in the last two games of the US Open having a bandage of appreciable size over the left thigh, accusing muscle problems.
Immediately after returning to Romania, Constanta paid a visit to the sports medicine clinic with which she has been collaborating for a long time.
After the specialist investigations, Simona was prescribed a treatment.
Halep is expected to return to competition next week when he plays in China at the Guangzhou tournament.
The region that is “growing” millionaires
Millionaires from Asia-Pacific will form the world’s wealthiest people this year, thanks to wealth accrued in China and India, according to a study published Wednesday by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
According to the report, in 2015, the cumulative wealth of Asia Pacific millionaires will exceed the total of $15.8 billion recorded in 2014, as well as the wealth of North American millionaires, who currently represent the richest people in the world, with an aggregate wealth of $16.2 billion.
The Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very wealthy people, named in the High Net Worth Individuals jargon, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, up from 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are people who can invest at least a million dollars, regardless of the value of real estate and other possessions.
“In the future, HNWI’s wealth is expected to grow more in Asia Pacific than in any other region of the world, with most of the new wealth coming from the emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand,” said the study by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
The report estimates that China and India account for nearly 10% of HNWI’s global wealth and are responsible for 17% of global new wealth growth after 2006.
China, the world’s second-largest economy after the United States, had $4.5 trillion in total wealth in 2014, up 17.5 percent and 19.3 percent, respectively, compared to 2013.
India has the fastest growth rate of the number of millionaires, 26.3%, up to 198,000 people, while their combined wealth has grown 28.2%, up to $785 billion.
"Dorel" set up the traffic lights backwards
At Suceava, workers set up a traffic light upside down, so instead of being told they have to wait for four seconds, passersby receive the "h" message, which they can't decipher.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Everyone walks by as they cut off their head.
Two boys were to be picked up by a car because they passed on red.
“Road police should be here, to help, until the world gets used to it,” one woman told the source.
The traffic light was recently mounted in front of the Great Market in the center of Suceva, but the passers-by do not seem at all eager to take it into account, especially as the information received seems to be incomprehensible.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If “Dorel” did his job right and someone found himself responsible enough to give his all to the end of the work, then he would not have gotten into this absurd situation.
The head of the Street Administration and Road Systematization department at Mayor’s Office Suceava candidly acknowledges that he was there when the traffic lights started to work, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We gave it to them, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
“I was there when they were put into office,” said Stefan Vasincu, promising that the problem would be resolved as soon as possible.
Thank God it can be remedied, because there are situations where "Dorel" has done irreparable damage.
For example, when he worked on the Giurgiu-Ruse gas pipeline, "Dorel" lost the drilling mill that digs the tunnel under the Danube, it is not known where, probably under the ground, buried, it was anyway not found, as even the Minister of Economy, Mihai Tudose claimed.
Police Put Water Cannons on Immigrants
On Hungary’s main border with Serbia, Hungarian border guards used water cannons and tear gas against migrants on Wednesday.
Although Hungary closed the border with a barbed wire fence and introduced tough measures against illegal immigrants, including arrest, at the Serbian-Hungarian border continued to gather refugees.
The water cannons were put into operation when the migrants managed to penetrate through the barbed wire fence through the crossing point at the Roszke border.
Hungarian police say the cannons were a crowd control measure that throws away water bottles.
There are no reports of any injuries, but some people are crying after using tear gas.
Elena Enikos writes, at the same time, that two German companies refuse to deliver barbed wire to Hungary.
The country has already raised the fence at the border with Serbia and on Tuesday announced its intention to raise one and at the border with Romania, the initiative strongly criticized in Bucharest.
German companies claim that barbed wire is very dangerous and causes cuts that can become infected.
It is used to secure prisons or military installations, but it should not be used against people seeking shelter, companies say.
In parallel to the clashes at Hungary’s border, Croatia has mobilized to make buses available to migrants to transport those who show up at the country’s border with Serbia.
The Croatian Interior Ministry confirmed that the buses were sent to the border to take migrants to reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia from Serbia, including 73 children, the ministry said.
Tsipras on Greece's drama: why it agrees with the EU's third deal
The stated goal of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from further austerity and fundamentally change its relationship with the EU leadership in Brussels.
Eventually, the Syriza leader made Greece part of a third loan agreement for the country, implying even more years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, who is hosting an interview with it.
Now, however, Tsipras is calling on the Greeks to re-appoint him as prime minister in elections that he says will strengthen his political position.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not a exit from the eurozone or the dismemberment of the eurozone.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of restructuring the debt for Greece remains open," the former Greek prime minister said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
“But I knew from the start that any compromise would be in the form of an agreement,” Tsipras said.
The financing side of the deal is a great success for the Greek government, showing that all the country’s financial needs are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says that Greece "definitely needs reforms", saying that it must start with the reform of the state.
Tsipras announced his resignation on August 27, paving the way for early elections in September after seven stormy months at the head of the Athens executive, when a third bailout loan was approved for Greece.
He got his throat broken and burns of degree one after he blew them up in front of his electronic cigarette.
A 23-year-old man in Georgia suffered grade one burns, a fracture to his neck and finger and a coin-shaped hole in the sky after an electronic cigarette he smoked exploded in front of him.
James Lauria was taking a short break from smoking at work when the incident occurred, after which he spent a week in intensive care.
Lauria, who was connected to a breathing apparatus, also suffered hand and corneal burns and a front tooth entered her gums.
I was at work and things were calming down and I went out for a second, as I always do.
“It just blew up and I was on my way to the hospital in an ambulance, that’s the last thing I remember,” Lauria said.
Six weeks after the accident, Lauria still cannot swallow solid food and follows a liquid diet as she recovers at her parents’ home.
The e-cigarette that caused the man’s injuries is in the custody of the authorities, who are conducting an investigation into the incident.

Star Trek actress in jail for stripping in front of children
Actress Jennifer Lien, from Star Trek, where she played for three seasons, intruding on Kes, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that took her to prison, where she has been since Sept. 3 -- the bail was set at $2,500 -- took place outside her Tennessee home.
The star began arguing with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of her children crying, Mirror reports.
At one point, during the argument, the actress lifted her shirt, showing off her bust, so that then, before entering the house, she would also take off her pants.
When the police arrived, Jennifer refused to dress.
Moreover, she threatened to kill the cops and was forcibly taken to the car.
It’s not the first time the 41-year-old actress has trouble with the police; in April, she was also arrested, then found guilty of the attack.
Jennifer has been in the shoes of Kes since 1995, after which she appeared in "American History X", the film in which Edward Norton also starred.
He quit acting in 2002 when his first child was born.
She is married to writer and film producer Phil Hwang.
They're being targeted by Western machine guns.
Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has given a rare interview to Russian media, in which he talks about refugees and accuses the West of supporting terrorists and “targeting” immigrants.
“The West has supported the terrorists since the beginning of the crisis when it said this is a peaceful uprising,” Assad said in an interview with Russia Today.
The Damascus leader claims that his Western counterparts say the situation in Syria is terrorism like the Islamic State, “but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president.”
As long as this propaganda continues, there will be more refugees.
So it’s not about Europe not accepting or embracing them as refugees, it’s about not addressing the cause.
If you're worried about them, you don't support terrorists anymore.
That's what we think about the crisis.
“This is the core of the whole refugee issue,” the Syrian leader added.
Assad has continued the accusations against Western states and their treatment of refugees.
It is as if the West is now crying for refugees with one eye and targeting them with the machine gun with the second eye, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, primarily because of terrorists and crimes and secondly because of the results of terrorism.
“When you have terrorism and you have the destruction of infrastructure, you will not have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to win their existence somewhere in this world,” Assad said.
"If we asked any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family,'" he said, adding that the political forces, whether inside or outside the government, "should unite around what the Syrian people want."
The Syrian president believes that the dialogue in his country should be continued "to reach a consensus", which can only be implemented "unless we defeat terrorism in Syria".
“I would like to take this opportunity to call on all forces to unite against terrorism, because that is how we, as Syrians, can achieve the political goals we want through dialogue and political action,” Assad said.
He also spoke of one of his country’s allies, Russian President Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, he was transformed, from the friend of the West, into his enemy.
Bashar Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, accusing the West once again of falsifying reality in both cases.
Look at what happened in the Western press after the coup in Ukraine.
What's wrong?
President Putin has been transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and has been characterized as a tar.
He is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses the opposition in Russia and who came to power by undemocratic means, despite being elected in democratic elections, and the West itself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
They are no longer democratic.
"This is Western propaganda," the Damascus leader said.
Last but not least, he included Russia on the list of friendly countries – and regional partners – with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, alongside Iran and Iraq, “because it faces the same type of terrorism.”
Instead, Bashar Assad criticized Turkey, another neighboring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that "I can not even make a move without coordinating first with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, the president of Syria accuses the “international coalition” led by the United States, which fights against terrorism: “In fact, since this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State has begun to expand.”
In other words, the coalition has failed and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries like Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight terrorism.
You can’t be against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will sting you - then we have no objection to cooperating with all these countries, considering that it is a real coalition, not a fake, that fights terrorism," he said.
Autumn?
Not at all.
Over 30 degrees
The weather will be quite warm on Wednesday, especially in the west of the country, where temperatures will exceed 30 degrees.
In Bucharest, 26 degrees will be recorded at noon.
Two degrees less will be on the coast, while the mountain also announces 26 degrees, in Brasov.
There will be 21 degrees in Moeciu, 23 in Bran, 23 in Paraul Colde, 20 in Predeal and 20 in Busteni.
Warmer weather will be in the west of the country, where the mercury in the thermometers will pass the 30-degree threshold.
31 degrees will be recorded at Satu Mare, 29 at Zalau, 30 at Cluj Napoca, 31 at Oradea, 28 at Alba Iulia, 30 at Arad, Timisoara and Caransebes.
The sky will also be clear in the east, where meteorologists announce 27 degrees to Botosani, 25 to Suceava, 23 to Piatra Neamt, 26 to Iasi, Vaslui and Bacau, 25 to Focsani and 26 to Galati.

Map of the countries with the biggest cheapities and how to stay in Romania
The collapse of the oil price has caused great losses in the last year to the workers in the extraction of titanium, to the shareholders of the energy companies and to the countries that depend very much on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: Gasoline has become very cheap.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that between October 2014 and July 2015, in almost all of the 76 countries considered, the price of fuel dropped.
The most significant reduction in pump prices is seen in Venezuela.
In this country, diesel is 97% cheaper, so you can power 24 SUVs for less than a dollar.
On the opposite side is Saudi Arabia, where the price is fixed by the state.
The cost of diesel varies from country to country, depending on the refining conditions, changes in terms of taxation, but also currency fluctuations.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price in each state into US dollars.
Situation in Romania
Bloomberg data shows that, in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (approximately 3.8 liters) was $5.49.
Thus, we rank 27th among the countries with the most expensive fuel.
But we don’t have to worry about this position at the top.
For the last quarter of 2014, petrol was also cheaper for the Romanians.
At the time, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which is a 10.6% price reduction.
However, the countries around us are even better off.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of gasoline costs $4.92, and in Hungary - $5.20.
The Germans are planning the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: what Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed on Tuesday night that the federal government would provide additional support to the federation’s 16 states in welcoming and distributing the tens of thousands of migrants entering the country across southern Europe.
After a nearly four-hour meeting with prime ministers from the 16 federal states, Merkel said “the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to deal with the large number of refugees,” the DPA news agency notes.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals, as well as distribution centers.
"Such pivotal points are needed," she said.
The whole country must provide a massive impetus to deal with the crisis, Merkel added.
The prime ministers have been asking for more help than the 6 billion euros agreed by the ruling coalition at the federal level more than a week ago.
Thuringian Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow of the Left Party called for an amount "at least double, and for commitments, to be accelerated," in comments to a local newspaper.
In turn, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Malu Dreyer insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.
“We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also businesses, trade unions and civil society,” she said.
Dreyer also called for the bureaucracy in handling refugees and migrants to be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the processing in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany took more than 5 months.
Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer expressed similar sentiments.
So far, Bavaria bears the heaviest burden, with most migrants arriving after crossing the Austrian border.
Seehofer, a powerful actor on the federal scene as head of the Christian Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, came into public conflict with Merkel after the chancellor announced a virtual policy of open doors earlier this month.
Mircea Lucescu makes scandal after humiliating defeat with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nerve chariot at the end of the Real Madrid match, which Sahtior Donetk lost 0-4.
The Romanian coach was totally disturbed by the arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost because she was disadvantaged.
Before the match, I said one thing, that I wanted to be respected.
Unfortunately, in matches with the major teams in Europe we are always disadvantaged by arbitration.
They are two totally different ways.
We were given a yellow card immediately, while the top teams were not.
The first penalty was not at all.
The ball hit Darijo in the back without touching his hand.
A game of this level should not be influenced by arbitration.
“I regret that the arbitration has ruined the game,” Mircea Lucescu said at the press conference.
"Ma'am, what do you smell like here?"
There were pieces of the broken husband.
A murder by an ordinary sadist has terrified the inhabitants of Targu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, in the early hours of the day, merchants in Targu Frumos could see terrifying scenes near the main entrance to the market.
Next to the three dumpsters, the criminals “assembled” from the pieces what appeared to be the body of a man.
It was severed, but lacked its head, internal organs, and genitals.
In the end, it would turn out to be the body of a former officer, who had been torn apart by his wife, a geography professor.
"The newspaper of Iași" was talking in the distance with the taxi driver who helped the murderer, without knowing it, to the sacks with the body shattered.
His stories make your hair look cheesy.
The one who alerted police yesterday to the fact that a woman carrying three sacks of horrific food, after pieces of the body had been found at the market, was a taxi driver from Târgu Frumos.
As in the American films, the man himself helped transport bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, but without knowing, the criminal being a client for a race.
The taxi driver told, exclusively for the "Journal of Iași", the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide the evidence.
He carried with his hands the bag containing the body pieces of the geography teacher’s husband, whom he had cut.
She had come to Targu Bellamos to hide the evidence of the murder as far away from her home in Roman.
Maybe he's got lambs.
I didn't know.
Nea Mihai, as he is known by his friends who practice taxis in Târgu Beautiful, became a star overnight in the small city in which he lives.
He has seen American films throughout his life, but never thought that he would ever start to be the one behind the discovery of a sadistic murder, and see with his own eyes pieces of corpses.
He says that on the night of Monday to Tuesday, he waited as usual for the arrival of buses that regularly transit the town.
It is close to the intersection of roads to Roman and Pascani.
The taxi driver says he noticed the killer woman in the rear-view mirror, next to the sacks with the body pieces supported by the indicator showing nearby localities.
She came in the night with the Massaro race, from 1.30.
The bus left it ten meters from the pedestrian crossing from Pascani, exactly at the border where it shows the mileage.
The sacks were backed by the sign with the indicator.
After the bus left, I marched ten meters to her.
I opened the trunk and, after putting on a bag, I asked, "Ma'am, what do you smell like here?"
I saw that she was an old woman, and I said to help her.
I thought he took meat to the market, to the grocery store, maybe he had lambs, I had no way of knowing.
I also thought maybe he wanted to sniff someone with that nasty meat.
She was trying to pick up a bag by herself, and I rushed to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
“She specified me to take her to the big gate of the market when I picked her up from the bus,” Mihai said.
I could no longer sit in the car.
He added that the woman said absolutely nothing, and as a result, he was no longer curious to ask her anything.
Until the destination, I didn’t say anything, because I was nervous about getting my robbery in the car.
And when he pulled the bags out of the car, I noticed that it smelled even uglier.
She took the bags out of the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I stepped two meters in the back to go back, and I realized that I couldn’t sit in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and moved the car back and forth so that the smell would disappear.
At the bus, I didn’t notice if someone helped her down the bags because I had lights in the back and I didn’t see well in the mirrors.
“There were two plastic bags and one raffia bag,” the man added.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, he says that his curiosity began to grind him.
In my mind, I realized something was wrong.
After she took her bags off, I went to the hospital, to the City Hall, and when I came back, I looked especially to see what the woman was doing with her luggage.
In the meantime, she had dragged her luggage behind the fence, where there are trash cans inside the market.
Then I left again.
It was a bit of agitation, as a minibus from Italy and a bus arrived.
I saw how the woman went to their drivers to get in them, to disappear, but probably the drivers didn’t want to take her, because they have international flights, and they don’t take passengers for opportunities.
The woman was very agitated, walking around.
At one point, the woman entered Peco and, out of curiosity, I asked an employee outside what she did inside.
The employee replied that he had gone and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because I had seen it some time ago.
I searched for them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and told them it was suspicious.
“Then we went somewhere else, a race to Belcești,” Mihai added.
He also told us that the woman had become agitated after leaving the luggage in the dumpsters.
At me, the suspicion started from the fact that the luggage had disappeared, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the police went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and pointed to me, telling her that I warned her that she had suspicious luggage.
Then the woman went to the dumpsters and showed them her luggage.
“I returned to the place where he hid the bag around 3 a.m. when I gave statements to the police and local prosecutors,” the taxi driver concluded.
The German prosecutors, who are investigating the case, say that the 64-year-old teacher, Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the cameras of a Romanian gas station at 0.55 a.m., boarding the three bags in the bus.
She arrived at the Nice Târgu at 1.30.
According to investigators, she allegedly killed the husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, then cut him into the house.
The man's name was George Zacharias, and he was a reserve officer.
On Sunday evening, the woman put the body pieces in two plastic bags, which she transported to the bus station, and hid them.
The other night, he carried another one, then decided which direction to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iasi.
Last night, the prosecutors still didn’t know where the woman hid her husband’s internal organs, nor did the genitals.
The head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags in a storage room in the woman’s apartment.
She was retired, as was her husband.
Until last night, prosecutors did not find out from the woman why she killed her husband with so much cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the teacher will be psychedelic, and the corpse will be examined by forensic doctors, to formally determine the cause of death and any other relevant details.
The City Council took over the national roads from the municipality, after years ago they had been taken over by the Government, so that they could be paved with money from the national budget, in the 2004 electoral campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and in order to be implemented it needs a decision of the Government.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a must because this in the institution to give the opinion for the Plan Ur banistic General (PUG).
The city has taken over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any case, a legislative amendment that was adopted in July 2015 forces the municipality to take over the national roads that transit the municipality.
No opinion can be issued from the National Roads if the law is not respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
The national roads have passed into our administration since today.
“Of course, the government’s decision will also have to be issued as a result of this decision of the Local Council,” said Interim Mayor Mihai Chirica.
The national roads leading to the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
National Road 28 stră beats Iași on the arteries: Păcurari road, Munteni street (at the mafor), Fire Mill, Silvestre Piercing, Silvestre Street, Nicolae Iorga Street, Spring Street, Chisinau Road, ?utșora Road to the exit of the town of Tomiu.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the Bucium road, Bd. Socola (up to traffic lights), Bucium street (up to Base 3), Chisinau Road, Bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, Bd. C.A. Rosetti and the exit to Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Following the description of some tabs in the "dossier" of Mircea Eliade's youth political sympathies that, however condensed they may be presented in excess of the size of a daily article and must be broadcast in the series, it is worth, I believe, evoking the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most vehemently accused used to his Romanian detractors.
A less humorous description would, I hope, be useful in the real debate that the recent law, called "anti-legionary", would have to arouse in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Critically analysing the various versions that spoke of the regimentation of Eliade in the Legion through the Cube "Axa" and Radu Gyr, Florin Turcanu brings into question, in the volume Mircea Eliade.
Prisoner of History (Bucharest, 2003), another hypothesis, which interests us to the highest degree in understanding the resumption of the contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after having played Ceausescu "the balcony scene" in August that year.
Relying on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure during the security investigation in 1941, documents kept today in the SRI archive (FD, File 573, f.15) as well as a follow-up note from 1938, Florin Turcanu states that "Eliade will not join their group, but in front of the so-called "Light" group with a so-called "lesionary group".
As there is no verifiable data about the nest of the Light, those in exile find the existence of this “legionary family” questionable, what needs to be discussed is, after all, the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
It is important to note that, in order to be able to achieve this goal, we have to make sure that we are able to make sure that we are able to make sure that we are able to make sure that we are able to make sure that we are able to achieve this goal.
Eliade's arrest was carried out following this note, quoted by Turcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, included in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a thin bureaucratic cover for the repression of 1938, and it is likely that such superficial notes were made in haste for the vast majority of legionnaires or sympathizers active in the public space who were to be arrested, but who were to be bound by an important legionary leader.
The holographic statement of Radu Gyr mentioned above, given in detention in February 1941, after the suppression of the legionary rebellion, only confirms retrospectively the first, the banal method of bureaucratic cover in any authoritarian police regime.
It would have been interesting if Turcanu had given more details about the contents of the 573 file cited.
Was it Eliade's or Radu Gyr's file?
Because anyway it must be a file built on security documents, but then processed by security to be used either against one or the other.
There is a misunderstanding here, as with the use of the term "member" of the Movement, that only someone who knows the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that it represents a preliminary, proving stage, in which the person in question behaves as an active sympathizer, in the trial period of three years in order to become "ruled up".
Also, all these secondary forms of organization such as clubs or intellectual cenacles, sezatories, discussion groups with peasants, youth or student organizations gravitated around a nest, were his “family,” were not his own nest, as a connected form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuance completely escapes the uneducated reader by making Eliade's (which may be plausible) "member" status understood and used ad letteram to designate political regimentation in the nest.
Of course, the invocation of such subtleties of interpretation cannot hide the public activity in support of the Guard, nor the clear sympathy for the Captain who animated Eliade in the period 1935-1940, whether in Nae Ionescu’s house or not.
Public support for a cause you believe in does not necessarily mean, however, and political regimentation itself is all the more so because, as a rule, intellectuals of this size retain a kind of superiority to activists as such and do not enter politics unless they are directly given high privileges.
As long as I could form an opinion about Eliade’s thinking during that time, when he was the “leader of the younger generation,” I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical rigors of a legionary nest.
And Radu Gyr didn’t have Nae Ionescu’s intellectual ancestry, though!
To mention, only in passing, that in any legionary "dossier", what prevails is public anti-Semitic activity as well as violence, both worthy of being stigmatized, non-existent in the case of Eliade, until new evidence.
Regarding Eliade-Gyr correspondence between 1968 and 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic defender of Eliade, tries to sanction the claims of Florin Turcanu (although based on some archival documents, even if they deserved to be dissected and more seriously contextualized) with a rather dubious argument.
Mircea Handoca notes, in the volume New Glosses on Mircea Eliade (Bucharest, 2006), that "no row in the correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr contains any hint of this framing".
There was no way in 1968, when, somewhat alive from the communist camps, Radu Gyr could not risk any hint in a letter that was evidently intercepted by censorship.
What I think Mircea Handoca wanted to emphasize is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was one of respect, admiration and affection without any doubt about Eliade's ancestry.
There really isn’t the palest suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been Eliade’s boss.
Intelligently, the poet forced to write to the Voice of the Fatherland, devours his embarrassing condition from the head to the head by signaling to Eliade (who knew very well what mission the respective publication had which had constantly dealt with the denigration of the right-wing exile), in the signature, after “your old friend” when he was close to expecting and was visibly disappointed.
There is no doubt that, beyond the "mission" with which he was commissioned (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could return quietly at least to see his mother and friends) and that, skillfully, he fulfills it dryly and by short sentences only shows his interest, separated from their characters.
No esoteric allusions, refined political complicity suggested, or any evocation of the young years in a register other than the cultural one.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior on the legionary line to Eliade, but until we consolidate this version with less circumstantial evidence than that offered by Florin turcanu, we have in this correspondents pieces of memory that testify to a mutual appreciation of some characters who have marked differently, but steadfastly, our culture and complicity.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not?, illustrious for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the "under the age" destiny of the authors.
In the early 1970s, Eliade finally renounced refugee status by obtaining U.S. citizenship and, under the pretext of health problems and flood disasters in the country, announced to the RSR authorities, through the embassy (with which she carried a sporadic correspondence used to obtain her sister's passport), that she could not heed the invitation to return to the country.
The following was predictable: he is put back on the index, the Toladot business is set up in Israel, the books sent to his family and friends (Fragments d'un journal, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, he never sees his mother again.
Of the country’s friends only with Noica, he still has a sporadic correspondence of life, surprisingly, as attested by the personal archive in Chicago, a lot of Romanian individuals or institutions still manage to send him messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr didn't get permission to write to her after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceausescu regime tried Eliade’s second conviction operation (through official invitations, Noica’s actions, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed into eternity.
New Coach, Foreign Players
Due to the shortage of native volleyballers, Penicillin Iasi is tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
The exits participate in training tournaments under the command of coach Dan Gavril
Retrograde in the first half of the year in the A1 women’s volleyball division, Penicillina Iași retained her place in the first escalation due to the withdrawal and then the demise of the group Sicița Miroslava, fresh promoted in the first escalation following a dam tournament played right in the municipality of Iași.
The news took little unprepared the leadership of the group from Quito, who found himself left without the main coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, who came second to scița Bacău) and many missing players, some retired like Cristina Lungu and the libero Diana Studineanu, or gone, like Ana-Maria sur Ibajana Voloia.
Of course, until the restart of the championship scheduled for October 10, there was still time to complete the lot.
First a new coach was found in the person of Dan Gavril, who came from the men’s team LPS Piatra Neamț and who has worked a little bit in recent years at Penicillin, he was soon to sign a contract with the group led by Vasile Left.
Then were brought two players from Sicița Miroslava, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconița, being tried also some foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to the transfer being the Serbian player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegreek Jelena Cvijovic (Zreninjanvic).
At the beginning of the month, the Penicillina lot led by Dan Gavril performed a cantonment at Gura Humorului, after which he participated in a tournament held in Lugoj and equipped with the Banat Cup, in which the exits achieved a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoraij and SCMU.
Next week, between September 23-25, Penicillin will participate in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship we are trying to build a valuable team.
We have a skilled and experienced coach, but the player background in Romania is quite low and that is why we will also appeal to volleyball players from abroad, especially after it has been decided that teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of athletes from clubs in Romania.
“We hope to reach the end of the year in 5-6 places, even if it will be very difficult,” said Vasile Left, president of ACS Penicillin Iași.
Emotional meeting.
Twins reunited after nearly 70 years
The twins George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, 69, were born at the end of World War II in Germany, after their Polish-born mother had just been released from a labor camp.
Because she was too ill to care for them, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, thus separating the two brothers not only from the one who gave them birth but also from each other.
For decades George and Lucian did not know about each other’s existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered documents demonstrating that he was adopted and had a brother.
In the 1960s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they did not discover any trace to lead them to Lucian.
Only in 2015, thanks to the Red Cross’ “Restoring Family Links” program, did the twins meet again, and the moment was more than emotional.
BBC News surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iași brought home four medals to the sports dance from Stuttgart.
Two gold medals, one silver and one bronze medal were won by children coming from the German Open Championship in Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organized by the German Sports Dance Federation and the World Sports Dance Federation.
In Iași, five pairs trained at the Dance Energy Club danced with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 outgoing children participated in five different categories (youths 1, youth 2, junior 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with the medals were the pairs: Razvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Tarzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Stefana Gologan (bronze medal).
Three other pairs managed to occupy leading positions: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Ioana Iosub Cujbă and last but not least the pair Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionita.
As a coach I wanted to reconfirm the results achieved in March of this year, this reconfirmation being necessary for both us as teachers and for athletes, in terms of their future evolution.
The fact that we were able to make the Romanian anthem heard twice this year at the German Open and return home with four medals, gives us great joy and gives us hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to the highest level.
“All of this would only be possible with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work,” said Andreea Ramona Manolache, the children’s coach at Dance Energy Club.
Romania has been represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, obtaining a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country as 4th out of 20 participating countries.
Of the nine medals, four came to Iași.
6 Ways to Get Rid of Stress in a Minute
Too few of us can afford to run away for a weekend in the mountains to get rid of stress.
Some of us have time, others have finances, and others have both impediments.
But there are solutions available to anyone who wants to get rid of a bit of stress.
They do not involve high costs or special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
Everyday cares are inevitable, but it’s up to us how we deal with them and what attitude we take toward them.
Instead of grinding you inside and feeling how an implosion takes place in your mind, try the following relaxation tactics that don’t steal more than a minute.
Breathe deeply
Breathing exercises are not just for soloists or yoga practitioners.
They work for anyone, and regulating breathing at a tense time helps release endorphins in the body, which leads to a state of relaxation.
Be a child
We know that we are past the age of childhood and we no longer allow ourselves to rest when we feel like it.
But that doesn’t mean we can’t go to one corner of the office or anywhere we know we’re alone (even behind the building) and not scream as long as our lungs hold.
You can get rid of the nerves and the negative energy accumulated over the course of a day with a few raging giggles.
Imagine a beautiful place.
We know the recommendation sounds like a replica during a psychotherapy session, but psychologists often use it.
The imagination of a beautiful place that inspires us calmly and detached from the daily frenzy, can lead to the attenuation of the state of nerves.
It’s really about self-suggestion, a process that can actually change lives, both for good and bad.
It all depends on what we self-suggest.
It is best to think of an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to the music
Put your headphones in your ears and listen to the music of relaxation.
Attention, it’s not your favorite music, because if it’s heavy metal, you might find it hard to relax.
Listen even to relaxation songs, which are smooth and do not contain lyrics, to regain your balance when your phylum is lit.
Peel the orange
Does the advice to peel an orange on your nerves sound strange?
Well, it's not!
Because it is not about the fruit itself, because it does not contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (occasionally, too totally).
It's about aromatherapy!
The smell of orange peel during peeling stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, the hormone of well-being.
Feed an animal
Those who have animals nearby, whether it’s the one at home or the one who has been groping at work, take a few seconds to comfort him.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, stinging animals can lower blood pressure.
hour and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with somewhat rival instruments, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces of Romanian folklore combining the violin with the guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is entitled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar,write hotnews.ro.
Florentin: “We found each other, and from that moment on it was a pleasure to sing together, having a practically unlimited repertoire.”
We thought that's when he met a guitar violin.
Cristi: “From the first meeting we realized that we can hear very well what we sing and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work.”
Each of us has learned from each other’s repertoire, and what’s very important is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: “I know there’s a gap between classical music people and the rest.”
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And second, we were stealing a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers, and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a genre of music that could make those who only listen to classical music listen to rock, and those who only listen to rock come to like classical music.
And we were surprised to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they would listen to it and like it.
Cristi: “When we find young people – and we find more and more – who know who Pink Floyd was, it feels great.”
Students in Iași stayed more in traffic than at school on the first day after the holiday
Hundreds of outlaws were “captive” in hellish traffic from several areas yesterday morning.
The town hall announced that from today Mangeron boulevard is closed, between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș.
The City Council leaders have not kept their promises to carry out work to smooth traffic with the start of the school year.
One of the assurances given by the municipality, at least twice in recent weeks, consisted of the re-establishment of the tour of the International Train Station area.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be assembled and the last deadline for the work was the end of last week, yesterday the tour was not completed.
The nerves of the drivers were stretched to the maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that another promise of the City Council was violated: the move of customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Tehnopolis "at the latest by the end of August", in the context of this transfer being discussed since 2012.
Currently, interim mayor Mihai Chirica says the issue at the International Station is more complicated.
The tour will be done at the right time, we have to take into account the movement of trams in the area, we also need an opinion from National Roads.
“It’s not like Zimbru, where it’s time for the tram to stay on tour, but we’ll sort it out in a way,” Chirica said.
One of the solutions, according to him, would be to stop the tram with a traffic light before the tour.
Problems in circulation were also at the intersection of Podu Roș.
The tail of cars on St. Lazarus Street stretched to the SRI headquarters.
“I’ve been waiting for good minutes to get out in the Red Podu,” said one Iesan.
By the Red Cross they had to move in September to CUG, if the rehabilitation project "Development and rehabilitation of the functional artery South" was completed within the initial execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement the original one.
"We attracted European funds for new works, for example over-enlargement, on the initial version the Nicolina passage was narrow," Chirica commented.
The most recent deadline for the re-introduction of trams is October.
Yesterday, the skiers reported traffic problems especially in areas such as Păcurari, Centro (Târgu Cucu, Independênă, Armenian Street) or the intersection of Base 3.
The Lords may return as chief to the CJ.
Tomorrow you will know for sure.
The judges of the Court will decide tomorrow whether the suspended County Council president will be maintained judicial control and bans.
The judges of the Iași Tribunal yesterday resolved a new term in the file "Album", in which the defendant is also the suspended president of the Iași County Council.
At the end of yesterday’s hearing, the magistrates decided to rule in the course of tomorrow on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against Adomniți.
The latter wants to live in or revoke this measure, which keeps him away from the seat of head of the CJ, for several months.
In the case of a favorable solution, and if it is mentioned by the superior court, Cristian Adomniți will be able to resume his role as president of the CJ.
The Adomniți was sued by the National Directorate of Antico Ruption (DNA), being accused of favoring the offender and false intellectual after, according to the newspapers, he tried to mask an audit that had revealed a series of irregularities regarding the reception of a public contract signed between CJ and the company Laser Co.
The Adomnists would have tried to hide the fact that the institution he led would not have received more materials for the promotion of Iași County, although scripturally these materials appeared to have been received by the CJ.
He was joined by three CJ directors and the director of Laser Co.
More than 3,500 people are expected to vote by September 25.
The city is ready to distribute more questionnaires if the 12,000 are exhausted.
The Jesuits have only ten days left to express their opinion on the replanting of teas on the Stephan the Great pedestrian.
According to municipal officials, about 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed at the neighborhood centers and at three additional points in the city (Copou Park, Alexander the Good Esplanade and City Hall) have been completed so far.
A record number of exits showed up on Sunday in front of the City Hall.
According to the representatives of the civic group "Iași loves teii", 530 yeseños voted in 140 minutes, respectively, almost four votes cast each minute.
On Mondays, around 440 people came to the same place.
The group’s volunteers say that many people are demanding the signage and the inefficient public consultation.
Therefore, they called on internet users yesterday to print out an information poster made available by the group and glue it into the block stairs.
The volunteers also showed that at the additional point in Copou Park the last forms were completed by exits on Sunday.
We'll be offering forms from the neighborhood centers, where they don't fill out very much.
“We will make any additions when all 12,000 forms are completed,” said Sebastian Buraga, a spokesman for the municipality.
“Scruti nui des tei” will end on September 25, and if the majority vote of the yesens is in favor of replanting the trees then the City Council will plant silver tei this fall.
Yesseni can express their opinion at the neighborhood centers of Dacia, Fimosa, Tătărași, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as in the additional points mentioned above.
The mayor decided to cut the roofs of Stefan cel Mare at the beginning of 2013, an action that attracted a fine of 60,000 lei to the municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without a consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous emergence of the civic group "Ice loves tea", an online community that comprises about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for the replanting of tees was signed, until last night, by more than 9,100 supporters.
RECORD of students enrolled at USAMV Iași!
There are 920 in the first year.
The university has 920 students this year.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" said that this year they were the most admitted candidates ever, in the history of the institution of higher education, since its establishment.
We are very pleased with this year’s admissions results.
We have the highest number of admitted candidates in the history of the university, almost 920 students in year I. We have never exceeded such a number.
"We also had candidates with higher averages, we took up our positions from budget to bachelor's and master's degrees," said Prof. Dr. Ioan Zenu, prorector responsible for teaching activity.
He added that the university also enrolled a considerable number of students to the fee, occupying 20% of the respective positions, a figure significantly higher than in other years.
Although the results have also been published at the study lines in Romanian, admission still continues to the study program in English from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which took out 50 places in the competition, where the fee is 5,000 euros, and now expects a response from the ministry on the confirmation of the student files and the necessary study visas.
In the autumn session, a total of 120 files were submitted on the 14 budgeted seats and 209 were submitted to the competition on a "fee" basis, at the undergraduate studies.
Most of the files were filed at the Faculty of Agriculture, 75 at Horticulture were 23, and at Zootechnie, 22.
In the autumn session, 18 files were submitted to the master’s degree, including the 150 places proposed by USAMV, seven of them in Agriculture, five in Horticulture and six in Viehzucht.
Drivers are afraid of entering the cracks of the Tudor Vladimirescu bridge with their car wheels.
The bridge over the Bahlui on Tudor Vladimirescu Boulevard remained as rugged as when the "Iași Newspaper" wrote about the problems it presented 10 days ago.
Reporters of our daily reported that on the axis that delimits the two directions of walking the asphalt has left, appearing deep pits, some even 20 centimeters, through which you can see the concrete plates that represent the primary infrastructure of the bridge.
The asphalt also began to crack on either side of the axle, showing signs that the depths would intensify.
At the time, interim mayor Mihai Chirica said that the bridge has no structural problems, a technical expertise was recently made, with a view to starting a project to rehabilitate the bridge and the tramway, worth 5 million euros.
Mayor Chirica said the area affected by the cracks and pits will be signalled, and work will be carried out quickly to restore the asphalt.
But the only steps taken so far have been the installation of stalls and a signal strip, without even a simple filling.
During this time, we focused more on opening the school and the necessary work for this purpose.
“There is a punctual expertise for the bridge that we expect in about a week with the necessary details of the intervention, I appreciate that in no more than two weeks we could move on to remedy the situation,” said the interim mayor.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stephan, started school.
Preparatory class, how he tries to improve the situation.
I do not know whether to rejoice or to let myself be overcome by melancholy; I am inclined, passively, to the second option.
First, because I feel like it’s only been three weeks, not three years since I first took him emotionally to the kindergarten.
Though he breathes a breath of relief, no normal parent is happy to raise his children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then began a story that, to this day, has not ended.
I was not what is usually called a conscientious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
I have always liked school.
So much so that I chose to keep going, even as a teacher.
When I decided this was what I wanted to do my whole life, I knew it wasn’t an easy job.
And none with any stakes.
That’s because, like each one of us, I’ve come across all kinds of teachers: better or worse, more sympathetic or unbearable, smarter or really stupid.
Unfortunately, there are also people with other callings in this fold.
I think they’re toxic, because it hurts the enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form.
I was lucky enough to give, while I was a student or student, over a few, few, exceptional teachers.
These meetings can be decisive if they happen at the right time.
Whoever thinks that the role of the chair is the trivial transmission of information is wrong.
This can be done by anyone; to be informed, you can inform the student very well on your own, that we only live in the era of transparency.
A good teacher shapes the minds of students.
It shapes them, molds their thinking.
Sitting at the chair is not a privilege, as I think it is, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very hot-tempered, demanding, unforgiving, and always willing to look for the hibels of those in their lives.
It dictates their age, their temperament.
In adolescence, we all thought we knew everything, that we had unwavering certainty about everything.
When we grow up, we come to realize that we have only doubts.
That’s why the role of a teacher is to get the teenager out of their category of self-reliance and make them think.
That is, to learn to doubt, to ask questions.
Find out the answers on your own, both provisionally and provisionally.
Get involved in everything you do.
Discreetly point it at profitable models.
It is very difficult, especially since most of the time the student thinks that the teacher is his enemy.
One who can't wait to catch his foot wrongly to punish him.
But this justifies him, the one who is always misunderstood, rebellious, who owes it to live his age’s callings fully, to look at the one at the chair with suspicion.
He just can't naturally accept his attempt to order it.
Adolescents do not let themselves be put to the test, they do not accept restrictions.
Or if I give the impression that they are doing it, they take revenge somehow.
And, unfortunately, when there is a rigid person at the chair, who imposes himself through hardness and does not communicate, the students take revenge on the object taught.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with great writers, for example, because of the lack of tact of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who feel that history is a string of data, that mathematics is all that can be more tiring for their unripe mind.
I always urge my students: if you come across a teacher you don’t swallow, who can’t communicate from man to man with you, don’t let him take you away from the literature to which he should direct you.
How did I become a teacher myself?
I had a very good teacher in the 6th and 8th grades.
He opened my mind to some texts that spoke to the puberty of his time.
In high school, I met a university professor who opened the door to his library.
I was looking at him like a man from another world: he had the walls of the house covered with thick shelves of books.
I was lost in his library and dreamed of having one too.
I might have it now, but if I hadn't gotten him out of my way, I might have decided to become a footballer.
Or an engineer or a lawyer or who else knows what.
I don't think such meetings are accidental.
I don't believe in hazard.
It is essential to meet the man who takes you by the hand and patiently direct you to your own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me to just talk about what it means to teach literature.
Literature cannot be taught.
There is no teacher of literature, as there is a teacher of mathematics.
How to fix the ineffable in concepts?
You know it, at most, approximate, without claiming to convey petrified truths.
The one at the chair can at most guide the reading, that’s quite different.
But above all it can be occasions of miraculous encounters, between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the one in the bank.
There are meetings that can open his mind, that can lift, as someone says, the scales from his eyes.
Therefore, the literature teacher must, first of all, be able to make his students understand (feel) that between literature and life there is no divorce.
On the contrary!
A great couser, Al. Paleologu, said something only seemingly paradoxical: “How much literature, so many, not vice versa!” and he was right.
That is why a good teacher prepares you for life, does not make you a specialist in an open field.
Fortunately, we always have something to learn.
And we, the teachers, or especially we, the teachers.
Most of the time, a great truth is repeated only out of inertia: not only do the disciples have to learn from their masters, but also vice versa.
Ideally, the teacher should be a master and the student an apprentice.
Who, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own path.
Few find it, it's fair.
But it was the master who lit the spark.
There is no greater happiness for a pure-blood teacher than to endure as many separations as possible.

Extending the Fifa investigation
U.S. and Swiss courts will face new arrests
The U.S. and Swiss authorities have announced that they will start criminal prosecutions of new individuals and organizations as part of an investigation into corruption in FIFA.
U.S. Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced at a press conference in Zurich on Monday that the area of investigations into corruption in world football has been widened.
“Based on our cooperation and new evidence, we will pursue additional criminal prosecutions against new individuals and new organizations,” Lynch said.
In May, several senior FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this corruption case.
Many of them have already been extradited to the United States.
“We have hopes that other people who are being prosecuted will also arrive in the U.S.,” Lynch added.
Switzerland’s attorney general, Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, said his institution had seized several assets, including housing and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, as part of an investigation conducted in collaboration with the US.
“We haven’t even reached the end of the first half,” Lauber said.
So far, a huge amount of information has been confiscated, 11 terrabytes.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are being investigated.
A media rights transfer contract was also brought to the attention of investigators at the 2010 World Cups in South Africa and 2014 – Brazil.
FIFA is facing a major corruption scandal after the U.S. judiciary indicted 14 people, including two FIFA vice-presidents and many FIFA officials.
Detainees are being investigated for bribery and other benefits from the early 1990s to the present, totaling more than $150 million.
In the aftermath of the scandal, Swiss President Joseph Blatter announced in early July that he was stepping down as FIFA president after being re-elected for the fifth time.
Fighting like a movie at the theatre
At the Supekombat gala in Milan, Cătălin Moroșanu will fight the "beast" James Wilson
A number of Romanian fighters, including "scorpion" Cătălin Moroșanu, will participate, on October 2, at the Superkombat gala at Linear 4 Ciak theater in Milan, the last before the final in November, according to a statement delivered by MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by last year’s atmosphere, and as we promised, we will return this fall with a new five-star gala.
If we have chosen a new venue, a theater, then we promise a fight like in the movies.
We will have eight Romanian fighters in the program of the event.
In addition to the matches with established stars, we will have another gala in opening, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including Romanians Cristi Spetcu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
“The full program will soon be announced,” said promoter Eduard Irimia.
Cătălin Moroșanu will fight in the Superkombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination with the American James Wilson, known after in 2012 he participated in the last pyramid in the heavy category organized in Japan and the numerous awards from the bodybuilding concussions.
I can’t wait to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, he's really a beast, but I'm tearing him down!
I'm still upset that last year I couldn't fight in the final, so now I'm going to get back at him.
“I turn it into a cat,” Moroșanu said.
Undefeated in 2015, the brothers Andrei and Bogdan Stoica will have their last matches in Italy before fighting for the world titles on 7 November in the grand final.
Last year, they both won the KO in Italy, and now they promise to repeat the script.
I’m happy to be back in Italy, last year’s atmosphere was incredible.
“I can’t wait to meet the fans there and promise them a new unforgettable show,” said world champion Andrei Stoica.
In Milan he will also fight Raul Catinaș with an opponent to be established.
A little girl invited the Queen of England to her birthday, but also arguing in the letter
A little girl in the UK has sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
The six-year-old also congratulated the Queen on her longest reign, but did not forget to mention that she was not allowed access to Buckingham Palace when she went to visit him with her family.
The letter did not go unanswered, but the little girl received a reply from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for the invitation, but also apologized for not being able to attend on September 27, even wishing her to have fun with family and friends.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together to a talkshow shortly before the poet Adrian Păunescu died.
Both writers died from the heart.
The fate of Adrian Păunescu and Vadim Tudor is similar.
Both were writers and politicians and both died out at an early age.
Adrian Paunescu at the age of 67, Vadim Tudor at the age of 65.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died, to a broadcast of Realitatea TV.
Full of words, Vadim Tudor irritated Gheorghe Flutur and criticized Elena Udrea, the Tourism Minister at the time, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor told Adrian Paunescu with a smile: "I am envious of your posthumous glory, Adrian."
Then he smiled and said, “It’s not very laudatory what you’ve said to me now.”
Adrian Paunescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died on September 14, 2015 at the age of 65.
Two unaware people after an accident in Dumbrava
A crash occurred on Monday evening around 19:00 in the town of Dumbrava in Iași County.
A cyclist was picked up by a Volkswagen car.
The cyclist was not noticed by the driver.
Fortunately, both are in stable condition.
As a result of the impact, the car’s windshield and mirror were broken.
Two injured people are unconscious at the time of this news.
A SMURD crew is on their way to give the victims medical care and transport them to the hospital.
The police are on the scene.
Syrian Artist Turns ‘Super Mario’ into Refugee
A Syrian artist has created a version with refugees of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the plight of his compatriots on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of Italian plumber Mario in the Kingdom of Mushrooms, the modified video game focuses on the "Mario Refugee".
The character is trying to get past human traffickers and border police on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The Istanbul-based artist uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mufti for security reasons and said he made the video game with the refugee Mario after his friends ventured on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of war.
At the Craiova Detention Center the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Center that the youngest student is 15 and is in first class, and the oldest is 25 and is in eleventh class, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a center belonging to the National Administration of Penitentiaries to try to draw attention, and in this way, to lesser-known realities.
The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in Class I, and the oldest is 25 years old and enrolled in Class XI.
"There are complicated topics that society is concerned to discuss at this time, all of us are weighed down by our own concerns and problems, but we must not overlook the lesson that many over 100 young people from the Craiova Detention Center offer," Minister Robert Cazanciuc said Monday at the school year's opening celebration.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of material possibilities, can lead to tragedies, stating that young people in this center would have had another chance in life if they could have followed the natural school course of any child, if they had had the opportunity to teach us not only to write, to read, but also to receive moral values.
“The role of the penitentiary system is not to permanently isolate people who have broken the law from society, to lock them behind high walls, but to try to re-educate and prepare them, so that when they return to the community they have more chances of reintegration,” added Cazanciuc.
The minister said that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but also in the prison system, because in many cases the conditions of detention are at the limit of humanity and because, in the absence of money and personnel, it will be difficult to talk about the reinstatement of convicted persons.
We collaborate very well with the Ministry of Education and thanks to this partnership, every year, in the penitentiary system, there are more than 2000 graduates of school training courses.
Of course, we won’t be able to change overnight what hasn’t been done for 25 years, but there are important steps we’re taking.
"In all these steps we also need the support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that through your work many young people have a chance and do not pose a danger to society," Cazanciuc said.
The Minister of Justice wished success to both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the combined efforts of all.
“And because today is the feast of the Ascension of the Holy Cross, I would invite all students and teachers to visit the mausoleums of Soveja, Maresti and beyond, to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals,” said Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to vote with the bear.
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be abolished!
Petition of prestigious universities in Iași and country
More than 200 researchers, academics, personalities and students from the country have signed a petition launched by the Academic Society of Romania in which they ask the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even abolish doctoral schools in Romania "that allow and promote academic deception".
Among the signatories of the petition launched on September 10 are teachers and teachers from Iași.
Among the university signatories of the petition from the Iesan academic environment is, for example, Prof. Dr. Liviu Antonesei.
At the national level, the petition has names from former Ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miclea, to people of culture who are also academics, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
“Although the Education Law provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this fact has not been achieved to date, thus resulting in the lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools that flagrantly violate the ethical norms of scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognized performance,” the petition states.
The petition specifically calls for compliance with the Law of National Education, the evaluation of doctoral schools, the suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school in which more than two plagiarisms were found, until the assessment and remedy of the situation.
The last requirement is the suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school in which there is no minimum number of doctoral leaders provided by law that meet the criteria imposed by the National Council of Scientific Research in 2011 for eligibility to grant IDEI-type projects.
Do you respect less a general without a doctorate, or a politician, or an intelligence agent in the Middle East?
"Why are there no other academies in Europe that give doctorates organized by the secret services, and top military personnel who give their doctorates do so at autonomous academic institutions, where quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academic Society, initiator of the petition, also from Iași.
This can be completed by all applicants on the Society’s website, and the final signatures will be submitted by the organization to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people who want to get involved.
The party "For Iași", founded by young managers of politically unaffiliated IT, was launched the other day in Copou Park.
The President of the Initiative Group "For Iași" gave an interview to the "Iași Newspaper"
The Iasi will have a party dedicated exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of unaffiliated entrepreneurs and managers has so far launched last week the Party For The Same organization that will propose candidates for the 2016 local elections.
Currently, the core of the party consists of IT specialists, but the initiators of the formation say that all people who want to be involved in the modernization of the city are welcome in the organization.
The launch took place on Saturday, in Copou Park, and more than 200 supporters attended the event, almost all of them being young.
The special guest of the action was Nicușor Dan, president of the Salvati București Association.
He was the surprise of the 2012 local elections, when, as an independent, he managed to collect 10% of the votes of the people of Bucharest for the office of mayor of the capital.
"The people I saw at 'For Iași' I think are very good at accessing the public administration of Iași."
I believe in this initiative, I think it has chances, I think it has maybe more chances in a smaller community than the one in Bucharest.
“I will be with ‘For Iași’ all the time,” Nicușor Dan said.
ZDI: Why didn’t you leave Iași to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are rather sentimental and emotional.
I was away on many short business trips, I also lived a year in Cluj.
I came back every time, because I knew this was my home.
ZDI: Why did you decide now to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache: Now that we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have been dating for some time.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we became more timid, involved in smaller things, with NGO projects, various building or charitable actions, and somehow things evolved naturally and organically, and now it happened to be the time when we came to the decision that we had to get more involved than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects to make the work of local public administration more efficient!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimum computerization of the activity of the city hall so that the different departments, institutions and kings collaborate as best as possible.
But more importantly, to be able to publish transparent data about the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about informational organization.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular neighborhood, it is important to consult the public with the affected people.
If we talk about efficiency, we must not forget the public transport, we have the worst buses in the country.
New means of transport must be purchased.
ZDI: Nowadays, the image of a city is extremely important.
How would you promote Iași?
Andrei Postolache: You get on the plane and you’re looking for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industry events in which you can "sell" the city.
You have to want to do it and know how to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from the business and we brought customers to Iași.
ZDI: What is the brand of Iasi?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we have to be a city of technology, one way or the other.
We already have the IT industry, and we need to expand it, go into medicine, go into robotics, go into 3D printing, go on in that spirit and unite such elements.
I think the brand should be in the area of science, I mean here the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Iași already has a historic brand that must not be changed, namely cultural life.
I see the two elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures with which elections are still being won in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organization, planning, communication, working with people and carrying out projects.
We have experience in management.
We don’t want traditional structures, we don’t care.
We want to engage people, we’ll talk to everyone, we won’t just stay on Facebook, we’re not an online party.
We don't want to have "volunteers" brought in by bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there are enough of them.
ZDI: Should the mayor of Iași be more concerned with promoting the image of the city nationally and internationally, or is it necessary that the area of concern is always of a building nature?
Andrei Postolache: One without the other does not work.
First you have to solve today’s problems, the emergencies.
But if you don’t make your city known, if you don’t attract money into your city, at some point you will run out of money and you won’t be able to make, for example, streets.
You have to do both at the same time and you have to have competent people beside you.
The mayor doesn’t have to do everything.
We must abandon the model of the mayor-father, who comes and beats with the punch in the mass and solves everything.
Oh, no.
We're a team.
The mayor is the conductor of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract IT business people who can financially support the party?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something right, have an unblemished reputation, be clearly integrity and be honorable.
From this point of view, we have no other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or, why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for everyone.
Interview by Alex Andrei
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015 he founded Introspecials, after many years as director of the Endava international group (2008 - 2015), where he coordinated a team of 300 people.
Another four years (2003-2007) he spent at Synygy.
The company he set up with another IT specialist offers management consulting services.
The Rabla program for tractors proved to be a failure.
The general manager of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said that the program to stimulate the renewal of the park against tractors and agricultural machines, initiated in 2011, also called Rabla for tractors, was a failure because of bureaucracy.
Regarding the Rabla Program, there have been some trials in recent years, but it turned out that it was a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a regular farmer, and the approvals were way too long and then the world gave up.
Through this program, it was able to be sold somewhere in 10 pieces.
“The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces,” said Mircea Oltean.
According to him, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually, being the largest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by companies from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It is a very high competition with those who come from outside, all the world producers have put their eyes on Romania, they know these things that I told you, and they have special policies.
"At all the fairs there is a big crowd, all the producers are exhibiting, there are all kinds of variants," said Mircea Oltean, who said that IRUM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forestry tractors annually.
Through the Rabla for tractors program, initiated in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as combinations, were able to hand them over and instead received a ticket worth 17,000 lei.
The red flag was raised.
Labour’s internal ballot seems more spectacular and politically significant, as the newly elected leader automatically becomes its spearhead in the upcoming elections.
Rise, therefore, the red-lighted flag / Under its folds we shall live and die.
That's what Jeremy Corbyn played in the London Sanctuary House pub yesterday.
He testified to many facts and oaths / Let us not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial anthem of the British and international left (The Red Flag) can search it on the internet and would not be excluded from having a surprise.
With our heads uncovered, let us all swear that we will wear it until we collapse.
The author of these lines is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and those who wave them), but he respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn manages to unite yesterday’s left with tomorrow’s, this love story between himself and the Labour base will have a happy-end.
I don’t think it will happen that way, but it seems premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat, in five years’ time, of a leader elected yesterday.
Now, however, we can refer to the procedures: we have witnessed a democratic exercise of impressive scope.
British Labour did not invent the system of direct voting for the party leader among the western left.
The French Socialists have been practicing for several years a more complicated, motif-based system that allows the expression of all members and sympathizers; in addition, they have organized a preliminary competition for the nomination of the presidential candidate since 2012.
However, Labour’s internal ballot seems more spectacular and politically significant, as the newly elected leader automatically becomes its spearhead in the upcoming elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of political system, with the customization of power being more pronounced in Britain than on the other side of the English Channel.
In addition, voter turnout was high in all three "circles": the members themselves, members of trade unions and other party-affiliated organizations, and finally the group of supporters (who received the ballot after a brief registration procedure).
This last group gives us interesting insights into the perceptions of the left-wing segments of British society, especially those made up of young or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to get even more involved in the future, precisely because of the signal offered by Corbyn’s victory.
There is, as far as I know, no sociological inquiry that tells us too much about the attitudes of this Labour “outside circle,” so cautious speculation is permissible.
I think we encounter enough attitudes similar to those of Podemos sympathizers (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the observation that they will go through the traditional channels of the left.
If we want to identify a “anti-system” vocation, it is reflected primarily in the rejection of the centrist line, New Labour (for all, only a disguised form of thatcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go far enough to the left, that they did not delineate themselves firmly from the Tony Blair era.
The second landmark - in my opinion, and more suggestively - is offered by the recent Scottish independence referendum.
If we abstract from the separatist message and focus strictly on aspirations in relation to other political themes, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of pro-social-state segments of the public, driven by the aspiration for equity, adept at disarmament and hostile to military involvement abroad, but also sensitive to the new themes of the Left: ecology, assistance, and generosity.
The Scottish Labours thus lost an electorate to which they should have had, at least in principle, privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm for Corbyn’s campaign).
Such energies exist all over the UK, but the old leadership could not attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation as an outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, the Labour aristocrat.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the leftist anti-system in the southern periphery of Europe.
The term "anti-system" is too harsh: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
By next week we will learn more about Jeremy Corbyn’s first steps as an opposition leader.
We will see if the red flag does not resound in the House of Commons (it would not be for the first time), after the new leader has taken his place, primarily of the opposition banks.
However, what Jeremy Corbyn wants now from his colleagues in Parliament is primarily unity - and he really has reason to be concerned about it.
The Trap of Manipulation with or without Knowledge
As I wrote the article I went through my head to check on the net the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his person "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in themselves make me circumspect from the start).
I didn't.
In last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") I commented in parallel on two pictures - the one with the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the shore of the Mediterranean and the one, in fact: the two depicting the Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh was taken from the article “Syrian fighters come with the wave of refugees” (signed by Viorica Marin in Truth on September 3).
On Monday night, I posted a link to my post on my Facebook page.
On Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among other things, a sleeve pull from his friend (not only by FB) Marius Cristian: "I subscribe, but a statement. Laith al Saleh is not a jihadist."
On the contrary, he is a fighter against Assad, for democracy and the like.
"So you could add the rough handling to the painting!"
I have to admit, I felt like a bastard.
All the more so since while I wrote the article I went through my head to check on the net the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became in the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his person "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could within themselves start me from circumnavigating).
Because I trusted the truth, in its journalists.
On the spot, I then had no comment on Marius Cristian’s sleeve pulling other than: “I need it if I have (had) confidence in the Truth”
After that, obviously I took the story for little money and I feel indebted to readers with the correct presentation of the story of Syrian Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest I found was in an Associated Press piece (Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett on August 17, 2015, from Kos Island in Greece, where they spotted, among hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, a man trying to make amends in the chaos of the crowd.
The man was the Syrian stucco Laith Al Saleh from Aleppo who “is used to being in charge” since “he led a unit of 700 rebels in the Syrian civil war.”
Al Saleh, 30, had “a normal home, wife and life before the battle that cost over 250,000 lives and put a third of Syria’s population on the road.”
In an interview with the Associated Press, Al Saleh said, “Everyone wants to leave Syria.”
My city is the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70% of the country is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me – I fought against everyone.
Apart from being kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos reportedly offered him "an even more sinister encounter - with a man in which he recognized a Syrian enemy": "Two days ago, I saw a sniper from government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very upset.
From the material we also learn that Laith (which means lion in Arabic) was indeed on his way to the Netherlands, where he has a cousin - a former senior officer in the Syrian army and then became a rebel and arrived in the West after he was badly wounded - hoping to get asylum and then be able to bring his family - his wife and a 2011-year-old civilian boy from Syria.
After that, Laith Al-Saleh would not have ruled out a return to Syria to continue the fight for the Free Syrian Army (supported by the West) – against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by the Russians), the Islamic State and the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front.
A madness - whoever wants freedom must fight in Syria against not one enemy, but three!
I also came across Serbian material since 22 August, of which I did not understand much, except that Laith Al Saleh is associated with the terrorists who come with the migrants: TERORISTI MEDIUM MIGRANTIMA sounds the title of a news from http://www.telegraf.rs/vesti, in which they are joined a picture of Al SaleTH with a bar.
On September 7, Mike Wendling himself on the BBC website drew attention to the case of manipulation with the help of photos of the Syrian fighter: This viral photo falsely claims to show an IS fighter posing as a refuge - This viral photo claims to portray an Islamic State fighter posing as a refugee.
We learn that the photo (actually: the photo with Laith with a beard and a gun and the one with the THANK YOU shirt) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would have also apologized in the meantime.
But before that, just from his wall, the image with the two photos would have been shared more than 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
Too late, the horse was gone.
In Romania, on September 9, Carla Dinu of Hotnews takes over the story with the manipulation on the BBC, translating the title: "A fake photo went viral shows an ISIS fighter giving himself as a refugee".
Obviously, the photograph is not false, but the interpretation was false, wrong, in short: manipulative.
