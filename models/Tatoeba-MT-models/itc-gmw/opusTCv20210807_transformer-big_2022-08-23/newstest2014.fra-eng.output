Spectacular wingsuit jump over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over Colombia’s capital Bogota on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination with wings), it passed 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many badauds had gathered to observe its feat.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners struggle to find the money needed to repair the decaying highway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches over the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record all the miles traveled by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to reshape the obsolete system of funding major American roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of major-axis planning has suddenly provoked a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby for the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and eventually the road you travel, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress can’t agree on whether to continue, several states haven’t waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of drivers have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental ride.
This is truly essential for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, general manager of the Southern California Association of Governments, which predicts the state will begin recording miles traveled by every California driver by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don’t buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a payment system by mile.
“This turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this from user fees to mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in order to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chair of the House Transportation Committee, said he also saw it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Supporters of the Reason Foundation’s free market also appreciate the idea of charging drivers per mile.
“It’s not just a tax sticking in a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The move is also backed by two former U.S. Transportation Secretary’s who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go down the path of paying by the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have covered about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, responding to concerns from rural lawmakers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to their work or to the city.
However, several states and large cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the most important experience in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state mileage fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is trying to test a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is exploring how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer drivers recently equipped their cars with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their slightest actions.
“Concerns about Big Brother and these kinds of things are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who leads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
At the start of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location devices.”
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily commutes.
Nevada is one of the few states that is now struggling to find affordable technology that would let the state know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
Research into this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not meant to help motorists who pay taxes to states.
It was looking to break into the emerging auto insurance market, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices it tests have appealed to planners on the major axes because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically uploaded via modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive methods and much less intrusive methods of proceeding.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a plan based on the average number of miles traveled by all state residents.
Other states are hoping to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxation system that would also be equipped to pay for parking fees, provide “pay-as-you-go” insurance, and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Automobilists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," said an urban planning paper.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate about mileage payment is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising gasoline taxes.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unreleased Listening
The British musician hasn’t finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, released in January, he concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unreleased.
Four have already emerged on the web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone stunned.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dated 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that one could still rely on him to sparkle the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one turn in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke will release the album again on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will feature three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously unveiled clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe edition, five specially unveiled songs for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And most importantly, it gives a taste of its new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very far ahead and rock electricity cleverly mastered.
Unpublished already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a worrisome intro before a bright ride that gradually slows down to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John’s Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again makes reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The bewitching guitar riffs make you want to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun playing chameleon with these titles: turn informer, man aboard a rocket, Martian potential...
He hides and reveals at the same time, playing to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, including with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in hand in the photograph of the Louis Vuitton Invitation to Travel campaign, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their commercials, aired from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released before they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not meet the army's "universal service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London, Ontario, reservist with post-traumatic stress disorder, has been released from the military despite his request to stay for another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case came after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the universality rule of the service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are not fit for combat.
Under current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the military.
Data presented to Parliament last year showed that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal veterans spokesman Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Disney is betting on tablets to launch an animated series
US media and entertainment group Disney has decided to favor tablets over its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children’s series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie’s Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its worldwide launch on Disney Group channels is only scheduled for 2014, according to the release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the Callie pussy, sheriff of a city in the American West where she brings order with a magical lasso.
Each episode contains two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the life of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are becoming increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in mobile device use by young children in the United States: 38% of those under 2 years old have already used a tablet or a phone, and 72% of those under 8 years old, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago, respectively.
Snowden is ready to ‘cooperate’ with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for U.S. intelligence, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he believed that international support could persuade the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make it possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained following complaints that the NSA had tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the United States,” it should be taken advantage of.
Mr Ströbele, a German Green MP, posted a photo of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “serious and sustained” persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have deemed the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public utility.
The letter makes an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.”
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their TV in the not-so-distant future.
Cogeco’s subsidiary said on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus follows its competitors, such as Bell, although the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have a precise date in relation to this new platform.
"We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail," Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecom giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable providers so that its service is available through their streaming platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable CEO also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the ability to pay for services on a pay-per-view basis.
“We’ve been saying for about two and a half years that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large channel packages doesn’t work,” Audet said.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"These discussions will have to provide a new kind of frame of reference for defining our new Canadian cultural policy when it comes to television," said Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and is expected to continue with the industry this spring.
On the earnings side, Cogeco reported a net profit of $43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 pounds per share.
This is a decline from net income of 44.9 million, or 83 pounds per share, from the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline with depreciation costs linked to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the U.S.-based Atlantic Broadband cable company for $1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 pounds per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 pounds per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is up 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about the number of customers fluctuating in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a trend change, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat has been found in cans of beef products, sold by two small British retail stores at low prices, the food hygiene agency announced today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the chains Home Bargains and Quality Save, contained horse DNA up to 1 to 5%.
“Because horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product,” the agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests conducted in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people early Friday on Route 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that was coming in the other direction.
All four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
The traffic returned to normal around 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them as the plane descends.
The new hand luggage charges are for bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was intended to encourage travelers to pay the fee in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she said.
Airlines began charging for first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges put as much as they could in hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in those compartments.
These fees are one way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O’Malley said the new fees won’t really be used to raise money.
It's about making Frontier's most loyal customers understand that it's becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O’Malley explained that Frontier’s site and check-in procedures are changing to ensure passengers know about the charges before arriving at the gate.
Frontier hand luggage charges will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often rant about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are paying enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them did not pay the baggage fee.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand luggage fee three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other airline imposing such charges is Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the surcharges.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit’s hand luggage fee was $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate as passengers discovered the unusual hand luggage charges imposed by the airline.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career,” he said.
I expected to see teeth grinning and a fight erupting at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “passengers got on board at lightning speed.”
Frontier also does like Spirit and charges a $2 fee for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said passengers who drink a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who drink coffee can be reserved for free.
They will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for the drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline had followed.
Frontier’s decision to charge a hand luggage fee when passengers do not purchase their ticket directly from the airline is its latest effort to get customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for every ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of turning to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half of loyalty miles to customers who purchased their ticket through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut mileage premiums by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly from the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown of Denver, but her business declines and she loses money.
Revenues fell 9% and its flight capacity declined nearly 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to redress Frontier’s finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls an “internal error” and not hackers for the failure of its site
The shadowy National Security Agency said Friday it was a bug that caused its public website to crash for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the breakdown was due to a distributed denial of service [DSD] attack are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The once ultra-secret NSA, once dubbed the “No Such Agency,” has been in the spotlight and heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications surveillance programs at home and abroad – which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the agency and leaked by former NSA consultant Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked a lot of speculation that tonight’s incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta City Centre is now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who would turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta vows not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, and the employees were met individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” said Félix Bisson, Delta Hotels’ Regional Director of Labour Relations.
The closure of the Delta is taking place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be launched within two years.
For the CEO of Titan, "the Goodyear Amiens purchase project starts with zero employees"
After throwing the sponge away in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear site in Amiens-North promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tyre Titan, declares, today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced this, Monday, October 21.
After giving up the project to buy the plant in January, you come back today.
You had uttered violent attacks and insults, speaking of “so-called workers,” who “work three hours” a day, of “crazy” unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turnaround.
Is that to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man trying to save some of the highest paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when working eight hours in other countries handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with a fair price and skilled workers, it’s worth a try.
What kind of deal do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the factory was announced, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance pay, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now let’s imagine that Titan buys from Goodyear the factory closed.
From then on, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from Goodyear’s more than 1,200 current employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before he tries to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for CGT and Goodyear to seal a severance pay agreement for all employees.
There will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to secure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance benefits.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we give lifetime guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in North Amiens for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit drops as aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and aircraft deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also failed to provide flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial launch schedule by September.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it flew only three times, and then the question arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
Results did not live up to expectations and stock prices fell 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from “outperforming” to “sector performance” because of the low potential for the stock market to rise over the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transportation division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We expect Bombardier to register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is modest so far at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
At the moment, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders before the commercial commissioning of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was moving forward on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the plane's downtime.
Each constructor plans differently.
We decided to go on a first flight and plan for an update period, and that’s what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
Yet analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft just 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was assessing the timeline for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slow flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed in the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, up from 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics division was $32.9 billion at September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the small number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Aircraft revenues fell 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railroad manufacturer, said revenues from the division had risen nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The Transport division's order book totaled $32.6 billion as of September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division suffered from performance problems with a few large contracts.
Executives announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Shares in Bombardier, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc, would sit on the board, fell 8.5% to $4.83 on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, said on Thursday a 10% drop in its quarterly profit.
Two speleologists, 23 and 27 years old, had been missing in a ditch under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, it was learned Friday from the Isère Helpdesk.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one experienced in practice and the other not, had gone underground on Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We have not heard from them since then, the same source said.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, a technical adviser at the Rescue Squad in charge of the rescue organization.
Dozens of people on site
About twenty rescuers, ten civilian members of the French Spéléo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
In the late afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"This is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, passed the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry alpine hunters were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They got lost in the network, went back in their footsteps while waiting for help, the prefecture said.
Refueled, they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists urged to flee Google and Yahoo
The union of German journalists on Thursday called on its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo in the aftermath of new revelations about the activities of US and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging until further notice,” she said in a statement.
She said it was "scandalous" to report in the Washington Post that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) had collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
“Research done by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,” said Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
Repainted lights: MP demands resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
Minister Brigitte Grouwels’ project of “relifting” the traffic light poles in Brussels does not appeal to everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the center of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 traffic light poles of the region in the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The aim is to both "enhance security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all the Brussels traffic lights, at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to the Brussels deputy Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flaming" the capital and demands the "retirement" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content with spending insanely the money of the Brussels people in the relifting operations of the signalling poles in the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her operations of the Flemishization of the Capital," De Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally repainted herself in dark blue-yellow-black the Brussels poles.
According to the MP, there is now "no longer a difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brussels people deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who carries out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
“As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, which is 0.5% of Brusselsers!” concludes Mr. De Bock.
the Pont - de - Buis portico
The ecotax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on the spot shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national lane was diverted in the aftermath.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the Prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax porticoes in operation in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers who own a prototype of the smart glasses signed by Google.
They can thus acquire a headphone, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of micro-fibers or an in-ear earbud.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father got rid of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid of forgetting him or rather I didn’t know how I was going to continue to “frequent” him.
There is no recipe, no way to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that never leaves me, laying on the night table.
This is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily actions.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle with cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found her body empty, cramped on that hospital bed with the crumpled sheets.
Likewise, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused on the meager glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, by small apparitions, day or night, a little shy, a little erased, it quickly came back into my mind, evolving as it regained its place in the landscape of my thought that thought was mourning.
And then she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother’s person but simply a woman I didn’t really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her sojourn in life.
In dying, this woman had perfected her life and released the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This detour from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside as well as outside."
I've always been told that.
I never believed him back then.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was afraid, when I had pain...
He was talking to me, constantly encouraging me, inhabiting my body.
I could see his hands looking at mine, lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I was able to have a personal life.
He left me intimacy.
It lasted a long time and one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer there, but I always feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only, there is always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and fit into my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I would wake up, I would get out of bed, my father would wait for me on the landing and he would smile at me and rejoice that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to show me that he was happy to share what was happening to me.
And of course, there was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I take pleasure in recounting this common memory lived after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother was dying from cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
This is the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
I realized my grief pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I’m in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and becoming interested in the Middle East, to the point of making a master's degree in a large school, were not, in hindsight, trivial choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always there, so sometimes I think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and uprightness of mind of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a loving soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes set on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago.
Death after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers itself, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time calmed down the pain.
Only the lack remained, this void without answer, this need of her, to entrust me, to reassure me at the hollow of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning I see his worried eyes set on me, I see the dark circles that weigh his eyes down, the fine lines around the lips that the cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We feel his protection all the time, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile again, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to her in the middle of the night when absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a bit reached.
We feel carried and protected in difficult times, the setback of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay on the path she had mapped out for us.
If a person has loved you very strongly, absence cannot take it away from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I was unable to attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his view of things.
I have had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don’t know if I’ve adopted his way of being or if I’m just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he is there on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
Almost thirty years ago, my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and my son was 6.
The immense pain that then invaded me has of course subsided but it is still close to me.
Very often he "landed" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I woke up I was even sadder to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he said "I'm coming down" but with a voice so real that I woke up in shock, anxious and I lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I still live in the same house, and often I feel watched and turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a job with responsibility, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was Iraq’s deadliest month since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We are not telling the world to be by our side and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,” al-Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved, it will expand, and what is happening in Syria will also expand.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution established by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They were holding signs accusing him of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed to the public.
He was sentenced to a three-year prison sentence by the Liverpool Court of Assizes.
A top defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after he compromised because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was dubbed “Bash” and considered by criminals to be a “file of primary importance,” was arrested at his home in 2011 following police wiretapping operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trafficking trial.
Police officers spotted 32-year-old Sarborough dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a bar dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular user” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to illicitly obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.
The four suspects were then under police surveillance as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
Along with 32 other men, they were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of 1.5 million pounds, as well as more than $200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction would be revealed.
Today, at Liverpool’s Assize Court, Ditta, who works at Blackburn’s Forbes Solicitors law firm, fell out of favor after being convicted on two counts of impeding justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine in a previous hearing.
The lawyer’s fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing 60% pure drug under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner party at the Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet, and on her credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied cocaine use, saying he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
In an interview, he said he had an office in his home, as well as at his workplace, and that clients sometimes called him home for legal issues.
But the court heard testimony that he was calling major players in the drug trade, including some he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators knew.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “If someone needs to know that they shouldn’t break the law, they’re a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and getting too involved with private clients.
The relationship we're talking about isn't just a drug dealer, it's a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this has gone well beyond the ordinary boundaries of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to enable him to pursue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but disgraced it.
He got too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and let it compromise his independence.
Ditta denied any illegal conduct and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta went from a criminal lawyer to a criminal himself as soon as he started procuring drugs from criminal organizations.”
His addiction to cocaine has compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the ulterior motives of leading members of organized criminal groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should adhere to the strictest integrity rules and build trust in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation of Mr. Ditta, who was convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now of obstruction of justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in trafficking heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in the trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer session on himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America, his last guest at dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will return to the stage in December
The Detroit News reports that the soul queen will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board room of the MotorCity Casino hotel.
Franklin began recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music in November, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering from, Respect’s famous interpreter told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were “difficult”.
She said she was “happy to be back.”
Chin reduces the cost of its Christmas lighting
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered with a mantle of light: the heat in Menton could be matched with the lighting bill.
An invoice that, unlike many municipalities, is also paid by taxpayers, and not by merchant associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, there were at least two injured.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident reportedly occurred in Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or onto the tarmac.
Police quickly intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport car park.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, the school clientele will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five tunes imagined and performed by artists from the region, vignettes with a high dose of humour, teenagers are allowed to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Société d'art lyrique du Royaume will return with its Destinations lyriques, a formula that now makes room for the Pulperie of Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Apero lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the colorature soprano Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a benefit activity, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears as an air of The Bat.
Without giving specific figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to show reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future looks good, even in the long run.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
“Finances are afloat and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a step we will take in seven years,” he said.
“I would even say beyond that,” added Director-General Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been charged with hostage-taking, kidnapping, making threats, carrying weapons for a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were critical to the safe conclusion of this incident," Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and is due to appear in court on Friday.
New class action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new class action lawsuit was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that took place this time at the Saint-Joseph oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J.J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, brother Soumis, and then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph oratory, where he was serving as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was against only three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us, "I was in such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The special feature of the class action that has just been filed is that it allows the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also stresses that the Congregation of Sainte-Croix and the oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exerted a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless strangled them".
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the Sainte-Croix brothers' lawyer, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second stage, the hearings on the merits, is carried out.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
Important fire in a business
A fire severely damaged a trade in Montreal's LaSalle district on the night of Thursday to Friday.
Rescuers were called around 1:00 a.m. on Friday because of a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian-cooked restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took nearly an hour to control the fire.
The fire "caused significant damage to the building's structure," said Montreal Fire Safety Service Chief Operations Officer Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but close to 20 housing units, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested, as residents of one of the apartments may need to be housed temporarily, the SIM said.
Plenty of opposition to medical aid to die in the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which takes place this week in Ottawa, comes days after the vote in favor of the bill's principle on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay home, very few would want to end their lives, said Maryse Bouvette, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association.
If palliative care in Canada were to be emphasized, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejected the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of hospice homes will refuse to help patients die, said Suzanne Fitzback, vice president of the Hospice Alliance.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked, “I want to die, give me an injection.”
The director of the Palliative Care Association of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is disorienting the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, Gatineau’s Liberal MP, Stéphanie Vallée, says the concept of end-of-life will have to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press angers over controversial media law
“It’s a frightening country and it’s legitimate to ask the question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the justice system tomorrow?” the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media court “will always be biased because it’s an extension of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya’s place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it to parliamentarians,” he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to "take control of the media," The Standard said Kenya's democracy and freedom of opinion "had a hard blow" and harassed the bill as "draconian."
The passage of the bill comes along with a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping centre last September.
Kenyan media has angered the authorities by broadcasting video surveillance camera footage on which troops deployed at the attack scene allegedly robbed the luxury shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media official to question them, although the summons was withdrawn following a media uprising.
Under the new bill, media outlets could be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being “deleted” or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize an offender's property if the offender has not paid the fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also says the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere.”
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
Delivered to themselves, the politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and restored their superb wages of about 532,000 shillings a month tax-exempt – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociale (CSSS) de Laval caused a great deal of excitement for the management of the Hospital de la Cité-de-la-Santé, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmacy department found itself severely understaffed.
It lacked nearly 30 percent of the workforce needed, making this financial year “very difficult,” according to department head Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
We did not use troubleshooting, Ms. Beaudet explained.
We have streamlined or scaled down some of our activities within the facility to keep things moving.
Of course we have worked hard to interest our young people [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
There is a concurrence of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 promises to be much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back at work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the efforts made by the department to retain have paid off, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to stay in the CSSS.
Now it’s much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill our departures from last year.
Always increasing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always ride to three maternity leave when it’s okay, she added.
Last year we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.

Director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg at a young age in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama brings, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a 40-year-old sex addict since her teenage years.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to her eldest is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste for risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose bare on frosted paper will appear in much more sulfurous situations on the big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he turned to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt is the star; below the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing her actresses into their last entrenchments, always for the better.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday evening
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Méga CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following tingling in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility evacuated the room and warned the firefighters of a suspicious odor.
Approximately 70 people came out of the session.
The people were examined and a full reconnaissance of the room did not give anything.
Bad joke on a tear gas background?
Or an unintentional incident?
Still, the cinema management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was ventilated and everything went in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to bring in two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine was distributed in three pumpkins that had been emptied beforehand.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office that took over in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, a spokesman for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1,653 seizures of narcotics.
Airstrike on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese military, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of SA-8 short-range ground-to-air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place under circumstances almost identical to the one that took place on July 5th: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont ground-to-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation with Washington revealing the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor’s lowered Ukraine’s credit rating on Friday, questioning the former Soviet republic’s ability to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", sinking into the category of speculative investments.
It comes with a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chance it will be down again within a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government’s strategy will ensure enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs,” the agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine’s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and forecasts that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency judges increasingly likely a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of failing to pay an invoice of $882 million.
The announcement is bad news for Ukrainian power at a time of intense tensions with its Russian neighbor, furious about Kiev’s willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had undergone its fifth quarter-long contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5 percent of GDP, up from less than 10 percent before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, which has a budget deficit, has been seeking assistance for months from the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it a loan of $ 15.3 billion in 2010 and has only released 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by raising gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF found this week that “significant external financing needs” constituted “a vulnerability,” while also highlighting “signs of economic improvement.”
Economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Center for Political Studies said: “We cannot expect an improvement in the short term.
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the expert told AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also highlights the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions for the release of opponent Yulia Timochenko.
“Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium term related to Russia’s reaction,” S&P said, fearing “trade restrictions” from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine’s exports, has warned that in the event of the creation of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should tighten its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. Green Light at Publicis-Omnicom Fusion
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they had received no objection from U.S. authorities to their merger, drawing closer to the creation of the world’s first advertising agency.
The merger brings the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis, closer together.
“Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the previously announced review deadline for the merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,” the two groups said in a statement.
They also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in the other jurisdictions meet many of the conditions necessary for carrying out the operation.
“The merger is also conditional on obtaining further regulatory approvals and approval from shareholders of both groups,” they added.
Congolese army hunts down M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) said on Thursday that its units would hunt down M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be on the verge of being beaten after being driven out of the towns in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that it has controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurgency.
"We will pursue M23 and hold it wherever it hides because it's criminal," FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not alter his demands at the peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
There are reports of clashes in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to have fallen this week, as well as in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the government garrison’s escape and the passivity of the Monusco’s peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's largest in terms of numbers, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid response brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was refurbished and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of growth of government troops is unprecedented today.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” Congolese business expert Jason Stearns predicts on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic – it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has managed to defeat a major insurrection.
It would also be the first time since 1996 that any armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which fiercely denies it, of military support for the M23, initially made up of former Congolese military mutinies.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague has called on Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali mentioned the possibility of military retaliation following shells that fell on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be freed by the army one day," said a resident of the border town of Uganda.
“We lived in terror [of M23], we are traumatized,” he added.
Tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have proved negative, the health ministry said.
“The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date.”
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being infected after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Friday that its quarterly profit fell due to lower refinery margins as oil and gas production grew while falling behind the group’s targets.
Third quarter net income declined to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters expected an average earnings per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd produced a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year, with production expected to grow by 25% by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion over two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities declined slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to $380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, said on Thursday that net profit was down, despite the increase in its oil and gas production.
Schoolchild Transportation: The Complaint Deemed Admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Sherbrooke School Board (CSRS) has required a fee of $150 per pupil (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for pupils on two-residential school transportation, a service that the organization provides when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were requested.
"There is a mediation service that is offered by the committee and I was interested," says Ms. Lefèvre.
According to her, CSRS was invited to mediation and asked for additional time to consider it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions," said Lefèvre.
The School Board of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) declined to comment.
The organization only indicated that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hôtel-Dieu
Faced with the sling led for several months by some of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10th to "delay the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that will not be able to intervene on November 4th".
A request officially made "to run no risk on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but also aimed not to hinder the campaign of the PS a few months from the municipal ones.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective by that date.
Although, at APHP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of November 4, firefighters who insured about a quarter of the 40,000 annual passages to the Hôtel-Dieu emergencies will have all been instructed to take 30 serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of the boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, interns specialized in emergencies will give way on Monday to five general medicine interns.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency department of the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4," said Loïc Capron, the president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the APHP, which supports the project of the management.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," said Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
“But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency,” he tempers, arguing for the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on site, he said.
But it is up to the ARS to decide the closure of the emergency reception service.
“Things are happening gradually,” responds Nicolas Peju, spokesman for the ARS for whom, on November 4, “there will be no change in terms of service rendered.”
“The minister lied to us or we lied to her,” says Dr. Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the sling against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "warning launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision made by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
“They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
"If other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
They are regularly stuffed.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting at the emergency room in Lariboisière.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" at several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APHP are defending the "new hospital model" already launched since October 7 and which is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to be involved in setting up an "ambulatory care stay."
“Where will we go if we ask people to self-diagnose,” asks Gérald Kierzek, for whom “the concept of no serious emergency” is “dangerous” and marks a “medical regression”.
This is going to be the same as for Level 3 maternity homes.
People aren’t crazy, they’re going to go where there’s the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Santé.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP advisor from Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly states that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we returned to responsibility".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled on Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken out in favor of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, she would clearly disagree, his spokesman Bruno Julliard said.
Even if the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of deferral to the other hospitals.
Obama stops listening to IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House’s attempt to retake the NSA wiretapping case after revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the IMF and the World Bank have been monitored by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal.
Asked about the matter, a US administration official responded: “The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance targeting the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington.”
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had given orders to stop these practices in the past weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one that stopped listening to the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission introduced new restrictions on what data intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of that information.
UN welcomes new anti-poverty targets
The United Nations will now begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in highlighting the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “overtake national interests.”
“I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique’s founding president, coughing them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a t-shirt with the words “we want security” in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered at the Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been virtually daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, supported initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement was signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo reject each other’s responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo stronghold, on Oct. 17.
Assaults on former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government holds Renamo accountable for triggering the conflicts, and accuses her of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a “loser” who wanted to use “all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.”
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep fighting,” said Joseph Hanlon, an open university lecturer and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott municipal elections due to take place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure trove of war from the government.
The share of votes received by Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former Renamo member, is expected to gain more votes in the elections.
Mazanga said Guebuza – who is expected to step down by the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what the Renamo’s capability is, but it has conducted disruptive lightning attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has reinforced the frustrations that the government is arousing, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is up to the president to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“No one cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads,” he added.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that “brutal force does not weigh heavily on subtle cunning,” while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “far too violent, far too scandalous, and in some cases, far too obscene to be taught at school,” Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” means that children “take off completely,” with messages being “sublimated” into pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than stated.
The known basis of what is shown and not said.
One fighter from Hamas’s armed wing was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza have learned.
According to the sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shot by an Israeli armored vehicle.
NSA spying: U.S. 'allied too far', Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in terms of espionage, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged in this first admission from Washington in deep controversy with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the US and its European allies, this is the first time that a US government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA’s interception of communications and data in Europe.
“In some cases, I grant you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure it doesn’t happen in the future,” Kerry told a conference in London he attended from Washington on Thursday, October 31 via video link.
In his speech broadcast, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of US diplomacy has at length justified the intelligence and intelligence-gathering practices by the necessary counter-terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since foiled many plans of attacks, through the interception of communications and the collection of information.
“We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects upstream,” he said.
And, John Kerry told Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we strive to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," the secretary of state admitted, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said on Thursday that President Obama was “resolved to try to clarify and to re-examine these practices so that no one feels wrong.”
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, says the program called "MUSCULAR" and conducted with the NSA's British counterpart, the GCHQ, allows the two agencies to retrieve data from fiber optics used by internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in the month of January alone – ranging from metadata over emails, to text items or audio or video documents.
Such interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any link to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with anger from European states and as leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was unaware of such listening, Barack Obama refused to speak out on the matter, citing national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even returned the bullet to the European intelligence services that seized the communications, before delivering them to the NSA.
It would involve “military operations” in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and it would not target Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spy network that has also sparked China’s anger.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without its master asset, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, Ligue 1 club announces in a statement.
PSG, the leader of the championship ahead of Monaco for the difference in goals, released the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without including the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of his left knee when he returned from selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the crematized deceased
The crematorium of Père Lachaise organizes, at 11 am, a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, Socialist candidate for mayor of Paris, is due to attend, and will then explain, at a press conference, her funeral proposals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For a loved one’s funeral, the opposite is true: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-chairman of the Funeral's National Ethics Committee, insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes, for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "erasing of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly experienced in France?
“Because cremation is a new fact,” responds Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Thanatology Society and author of the book Mate death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To tame the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, general director of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to plan for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers want it too.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
“For the past ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting, doing nothing, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the surrender of the ashes,” notes Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who carry out, in the presence of the body, the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to name the deceased, to connect him with others, to evoke him, to make sense of his death, to organize the farewell.
This has been the case at the Père Lachaise crematorium since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Père Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of the people who have been crematized in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the move.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, rehousing because of rats turns to controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Frutidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
Faced with the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office proposed, on an exceptional and provisional basis, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, the director of the Office.
There have always been rats in cities.
The deratization company makes two trips a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not swarm in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, a child is not going to be killed.
“We didn’t invite rats to our house,” defends the father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon out of money and expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange Ends Down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended up falling on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The price suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix dropped 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony fell more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house the prey of the flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday at noon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 Hébert Street.
The flames broke out in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," said France Loiselle, a spokesman for the Quebec fire department.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the ceremonial master at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly in front of the audience, in the tone of conversation.
Fay’s innovation has continued over the years, until more recently being picked up by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theaters.
“Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year’s event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes,” a comedy and music night for veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Several of this year’s festival’s comedians have gone through non-traditional tours, including shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his front-page appearance in a sitcom on a cable channel (“The League” on the theme of FXX’s joyously lewd fantasy football) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate appeared on Saturday Night Live and was cast on Parks and Recreation, but is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, along with other young actors with the singular voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg chatting with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedic historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The rendezvous takes place at the City Hall in central Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would go down a alley between two buildings and say to himself, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here."
Oil price continues to fall and closes to $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the size of stocks offset a report showing that China’s electricity-intensive manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. reference crude for delivery in December fell by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel late in the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8% for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector that arrived on Friday, which show growth in business, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to solidify after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, following a decline not seen in the previous quarter for two decades.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
The Right to Abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal in Texas reinstated some restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a law passed in July in that state that broadly calls into question the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
The Court of Appeal’s ruling means that doctors who will practice IVG will need to have a “admission privilege” with local hospitals.
Admission privilege is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a nursing member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical center for diagnosis or treatment.
Advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one-third of the state's clinics because these clinics failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, almost 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge ruled on the eve of the Act that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, has asked the appeals court to overturn the first-instance ruling that blocked law enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star achieved a comeback, audience-side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6 percent of audience share.
But was the show at the rendezvous?
Approximately 10,000 candidates appeared at the auditions this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the perch André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of returning to their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored on that first bounty.
As every year, the first audition shows brew a wide choice of aspiring singers, for better and sometimes for worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, a few have found their account.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone all the way.
Behind the TV screens, the vocations of successful singer are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD scrutiny policy
A federal appeals court blocked Thursday a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's scrutiny and search program and stripped her of the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the city's appeal was finalized.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program aimed at monitoring and questioning citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department change its policy and associated training program.
The court of appeal heard arguments Tuesday regarding the request for suspension.
The court of appeal said the judge should be removed from the case because she violated the judges’ code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to court criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by falsely targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their control and search program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy, training and oversight reform, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in the neighborhoods where the largest number of controls are conducted.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is dismissed after a police check.
The city's appeal hearing is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 checks that concerned mainly black and Hispanic men.
A legal action was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a collective action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's search and control program say they will end unfair practices, create more effective and trusted police forces, and change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without lowering crime, represent a waste of money, and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers have been sharply reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that she was not ending the constitutional control and search practices, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Renters must go to vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the property that goes in taxes to the City.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We are forced to raise rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We can no longer afford $100,000 fireworks, $4 million to $5 million land for the event...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elysian kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the ranks until becoming a chef nine years ago.
He has served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their vacation spots, and has nurtured countless of the world’s greats in a near-anonymity that he only breaks today, at retirement, at age 60.
The man with an open face, degarnited skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I went from one castle to another!", ironizes Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has officiated, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
“It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus,” he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Notwithstanding the heads of state who showed a relative indifference to terrestrial food, "they are all greedy", gently denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had eliminated the cheese, the plates came back empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The former chef of the kitchens of the Elysée, who had a drink on Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in his heart.
He said praise.
“His human side has come out,” he says.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-room building, located at 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three fire alarms.
The fire broke out in the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, a spokesman for the Fire Protection Service of Quebec, said that the rapid intervention of the firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in a close manner.
The burning house housed four dwellings, but no tenants were on the scene at the time of the fire.
The damage was very limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Release of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese is missing a few images from his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and take out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will unravel you in his role as a crazed trader.
Martin Scorsese tells the true story of a “Long Island stockbroker who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast Wall Street corruption case.”
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort set up a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains the parties, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the main words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seem to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long montage.
It seems that the film lasts at 2:45.
In the hall on December 25, he will be able to participate in the Oscars race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm a fake pipe on a liaison involving then-incumbent Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his “pretty special counsel.”
It was reported to the court that the newspaper had instructed Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack into Pawlby’s voicemail and “permanently plant in front of her door,” but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
“The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stand in front of people’s homes hoping to surprise them, he’s the kind of man who likes to present history to people to see what they say about it,” Edis said.
He said NotW used three ways to investigate the issues: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, the surveillance, it cannot be any other way.
But what about the first?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say, “Of course.”
Rumors about a relationship involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW’s editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said she had been told, “Don’t waste your time with her, she’s with Charles.”
A tape, which recorded pirated voice messages on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective’s computer that concerned Miss Pawlby and her sister in a “Projects” file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Ms. Pawlby’s slightest facts and gestures.
In a voicemail he left her on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I'd really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson’s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other prominent men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiring with others to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking.
Barack Obama Meets Iraqi Prime Minister in Outrage
The U.S. president was due to meet Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five-and-a-half years in October, according to figures released Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN has an even higher death toll with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
The violence is increasingly deadly despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations launched months ago by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total death toll in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
Approximately two years after the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence raises fears of a new fire as neighboring Syria is in the grip of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has fuelled this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, further violence killed four people in northern Iraq, the day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a “world war” against al-Qaeda.
The violence is at the center of U.S. Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki’s talks that will be hosted by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and congressional elected officials.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a “third world war” against Al Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shia, attributing him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uyghur group of Tiananmen attack
China's Homeland Security chief on Friday accused a group of Uyghur separatists from Xinjiang of being behind the car bombing that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, crashed into the crowd on China’s famous capital square, a symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passersby.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkestan of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uyghurs, a Turkish-speaking minority in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there driven by independence claims.
"The violent terrorist incident in Beijing has been organized and premeditated," Meng told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.
“The group that was standing behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan,” he added, as his remarks were echoed by the Chinese news agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement of East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probes on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a large survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with instructions to get as many responses as possible.
The information will be used for an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to survey parishioners.
In the UK, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army attacks the last stronghold of the rebels
The irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred fighters, were entrenched at almost 2,000 meters of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," a resident of Jomba told AFP, joining by phone around 12.30, and according to which a girl was shot in the morning.
“The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little,” he added, “it seems that the DRC’s FARDC Armed Forces have pushed the rebels back a little.”
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before climbing to the front for a "crawling operation".
We could hear very clearly behind him crackles fed with small arms.
From Bunagana, a political stronghold and the last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear detonations of heavy weapons.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase, with the FARDC having "encircled the remaining positions of the M23 to dislodge them".
Since clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army resumed on Friday, Monusco has not directly participated in the fighting, but has provided government troops with decisive support in terms of intelligence, observation and planning.
In the late afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well stocked with ammunition, climbed towards the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to replace another machine pillaging the M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called on Wednesday evening once again the rebels to “willfully demobilize” under penalty of being disarmed “by force,” but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without result for now.
On the spot, the political leaders of M23 hope to reach an agreement.
“We have concluded the talks, it is only up to the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature,” said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mostly Tutsi, who joined the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which is refuted by Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the movement back to the DRC that had started in the morning reversed at midday.
“This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to retreat,” Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back, told AFP.
We have the impression that the shots are getting closer to the population.
In the early evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the productions sung and danced take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical is asserting itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart’s rock opera, most of the attempts were ludicrous.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables bore the hallmark of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the game.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as hits.
The first one picks up, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next the worldwide creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other stages, musical performances such as "1789", "lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" put themselves at the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Stories of musicals" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard won.
How do French musicals evolve?
The supply has multiplied.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve at the discretion of the producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others jump back fifteen years on the pretext that you can serve pretty much anything when you have Matt Pokora at the head of the poster.
Then there are the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that bring us back to the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects like "Rent", "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" or "The Awakening of Spring" are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like on Broadway to sing, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musicals, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
Jobs are numerous among regional theaters, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The pool of talent is as substantial as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often from boulevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
It is these same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Propose beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show, it is the assurance of an enthusiasm of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are expertly maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
The mayonnaise was taken up in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major theatres of France in the same form as in Paris.
Seriously injured in accident with ghost driver in Brussels ring
A road accident left a serious injury on Friday morning at around 5.30 am on the inner Brussels ring at Hoeilaart, heading towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who was unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9 a.m. at the scene of the accident, as long as the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause any traffic jams, as the accident took place at Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be deflected by this exit/input from the ring.
Severely injured child at Disneyland Paris attraction
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at a Disneyland Paris attraction.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the "Pirates of the Caribbean" attraction.
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares a new assault
Children play on a charred armor that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba, on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The objective is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by itself.
Only the hill of Runyonyi will remain.
"Chanzu is not very strategic," North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last stronghold of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23, are entrenched at almost 2,000 meters of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby village of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day said the situation had been "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the fighting the previous day and were buried.
One girl was shot, and three others were injured, including one seriously, evacuated by the FARDC, the witness added.
Since fighting resumed between FARDC and rebels on October 25, the two belligerents have not reported any casualties.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter overflew the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital, at low altitude.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, his mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media said the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence, again insisted in September that the U.S. is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant turned whistleblower, began to unveil his inexhaustible treasure trove of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders have no idea whether to believe the director on word of mouth.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. providers of cloud storage services, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked corporate paranoia over state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that made the vase overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence agencies and businesses transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data is used in their mutual interest.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the U.S. poses as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents released by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on trade secrets of foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“This is not the right way to do it,” said Hasso Plattner, president of German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations has been a shock to some companies who previously thought China posed the biggest surveillance risk.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data held in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-U.S. members have given up on their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations about the U.S. data mining program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers are asking us today a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, managing director of chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business leaders are generally unwilling to reveal the prevention measures they have in place, in case it leaves the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long hammered the message that it is at least imprudent to retrieve a free USB stick at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member at Audi, says collecting cell phones before board meetings, so they can’t be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany’s BfV advises its executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on their trips abroad because of the risk of harming the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown away.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industry secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV said in a report.
The U.S. is alerting its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty in the second degree of having carried out acts of economic intelligence hacking, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French domestic intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.”
The parents of a Georgia teenager, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found in a wrestling mat rolled into his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found stuck in a mat standing behind the steps of his high school gym.
Lowndes County Sheriff’s investigators have concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old’s family disputes those findings.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as stated in the Sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these findings were made for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a briefcase and we returned him to them in a mortuary bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated Johnson had died of “positional asphyxia.”
However, a second autopsy has identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“A lot of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence that would justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to hand over all video surveillance footage that investigators had reviewed.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video footage contained clues to the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on child allergies to schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines the U.S. government publishes, as the number of school-aged children suffering from food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the U.S. now has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of children's food allergies and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends schools have a stock of epinephrine – the most commonly used EpiPen brand auto-injector – to be able to react quickly in the event of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to stock up on epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “I feel like something stings my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue,” or “I have tingling on my tongue.”
NSA case highlights total lack of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand is offended in public by summoning the US ambassador on October 21, and on the other prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on board Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of U.S. surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the listening of the Quai d’Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't that be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by US diplomacy of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in the eyes of American power, this is an important enlightenment.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to indignate us with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations against our interests?
Can American collaboration be denied?
The implementation of very powerful interception technology tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas of Miranshah has been reported to the French through NSA means.
France can be driven, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to US services, and, in return - it has already been quickly said - Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the underlying issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, but the question of the total lack of prior debate, especially within parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that should be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of the breaches of freedoms.
What are the real dangers of the United States, a deterioration of its image?
We can denounce them, but I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk to Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies – and this has been the case recently – learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have tightened.
Another effect may be more economical: More and more European and South American companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. providers subject to U.S. laws, and thus to the grip of the NSA.
Last but not least, the vast outpouring of revelations by media around the world, which helps spark a debate about intelligence surveillance practices that have hitherto been virtually nonexistent, could prompt lawmakers, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose “indeterminate sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The masculine or feminine sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly attributed to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to report their child’s gender, allowing them to enter an “indeterminate” or “unspecified” gender on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infant, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and swept.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, with intersexuality being part of the group of 60 diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term for people with chromosomes or atypical (ovarian or testicle) gonades or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to attribute it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York who specializes in sexual identification issues, said the new German law “appears to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but that’s not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It’s like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is usually both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, (such as muscle mass, hairiness, chest and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs), or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-conforming gender now have camps specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognized as “neutral” after winning her trial on appeal that allowed her to keep “unspecified” sex for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F-X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school books.
The US website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that “since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overthrown.”
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer to have sex assigned to babies at birth.
“The parenting role is stressful enough with no additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, after the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely a decade ago, the medical community considered the genre as a slate, which can be erased and redesigned.
But now there are many who question the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about his or her sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we were not calling the psychiatrist, we were calling the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered gender malleable.
He coined the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it to be identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a flawed circumcision to have it castrated entirely, also removing his testicles, and raising it like a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he again became a boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “always repeat this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations say “[they] are not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn’t really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never have a “satisfying life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was forced to take female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn’t happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, undergoing testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he advocates for the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “calls for labeling and stigmatization.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an ‘indeterminate’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex."
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
The German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
It’s not a battle that young children should be fighting at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands in a support group, said German law will “responsible” parents and children.
Dr. Baratz’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
“The law gives parents some flexibility so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This gives them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a delay before entering “male” or “female.”
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don’t have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“It puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with – and that’s something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta judges that his government will last until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right in the ruling coalition as the Senate votes to strip Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate.
In an interview with La Stampa newspaper, the centre-left leader said he “firmly intends” to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former president of the Council convicted of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, announces his impeachment.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated last October 2 his refusal to yield to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Safety Agency agent, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of shots.
Firefighters called to the scene said they had responded to a call for “multiple casualties.”
“Police are on site,” the airport said on its Twitter account, as TV footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second person transported in a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that yards 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to confirm immediately if any of his employees were injured.
All flights to and from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire killed an Islamist Palestinian Hamas activist on Thursday and seriously wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip, health services sources said.
A Hamas source said fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army has merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel described as "terrorist" by the Jewish state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's Campaign Considered Dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event featured in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's much-anticipated 2012 campaign book, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and said Thursday evening that the president’s close associates had conducted “in-depth group work and polls at the end of 2011” to see if Biden’s removal could help Obama in preparation for his re-election as his hopes waned.
According to Times policy correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaigners and the White House, namely former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, aimed at measuring what effect the replacement of the Vice President by former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the ballot.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within the Chicago Campaign HQ and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president – including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew the change was under consideration.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “didn’t significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember, at that point, the president wasn't in shape, and so we were like, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the review "concerned," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to find out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
“Campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on polls and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not known if Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin told CNN he had asked Daley if his then-boss was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of the potential change, the former secretary general admitted it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” was not definitively answering the question of whether political polls had arrived on Obama’s office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know Biden’s removal from the presidential list was being considered.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice cream.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He came up with the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the shiny protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” said: “It’s something incredible but we’re still just starting out in terms of production, and 2g of this stuff costs about $200.”
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level goes up and the ice starts to glow.
We tested it over the last few months and it seemed opportune to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice I have created because jellyfish luminescence is worth four times more than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes pretty good!
The Bristol-based company is known for its unusual ice scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: “I would really like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
It’s inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I’ll find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" to residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his musician hands splitting the air,” writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also says she promised her husband, the week before he died, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here over the last few years.
And even though we are city dwellers, it is our spiritual home.
“Lu was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of life he had.”
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In Figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more sluggish.
Over the past two years, I haven’t distributed a single candy and I certainly won’t do it any more this year.
But the statistics show that I'm the goose sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is the trends.
Costumes are expected to be $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects make fury.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
When it comes to men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet Daft Punk space men will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's okay to stay traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they weren’t the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs disguised as hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, you don't glans.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
That’s about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
That’s great news for the 41 million children who go hunting for candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, let’s not tell each other stories, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don’t want to eat; and yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That’s about 9 billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to clear up yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the U.S. that generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes these great photos of you pissing on it that your friends put on Facebook and you can’t take off and on which a guy you like leaves a “nice head” comment.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve done since we were little.
Luckily for us, the “baby pumpkin trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these pumpkins and didn’t have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that gently wither on the porch of your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 922kg pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create a “bad bank” structure with 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of riskier assets to relax relations with London and accelerate its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it up within three years.
RBS also said it would file an additional four to 4.5 billion pounds of depreciation provision for the quarter, a write-off related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also specified that this internal restructuring would free up 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thus strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would allow to draw a line on the past, the government having in particular been accused of meddling in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, care about the future and the 90 percent of the assets that constitute a really good bank, and build a great bank for customers and the UK,” McEwan told reporters.
Land Rover Announces Sponsorship of a Series of Rallyes
The interior features 6-point bucket seats and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The fans of rallying who join Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try out different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of rallying raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a non-serious road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry.
Firefighters rappelled down the cliff to retrieve the bitch and save her from certain death
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called to safely retrieve him while he was standing 15 m above the ground on the unstable cliff protrusion.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career Wednesday.
Owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost bitch and launched a call on social networking sites after she disappeared in her career following a non-serious accident.
Around 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and went down on a rappel to save Ruby by using an animal stretcher to transport her up the cliff.
Technical aid specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the summit and 15 m from the ground.
She didn’t move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It’s amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical aid specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to have made it unscathed.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check-up; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified watching the rescue.”
At first I didn't think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him in my arms again.
The vet said that if she had been too exhausted and passed out, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were astonishing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely great.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: “We were afraid she would fall but she didn’t move.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never fucked Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a choruser on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He fucked me when I was 18.”
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a statement Thursday, a representative for 70-year-old Jagger said he “categorically denies making any advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, “Prism,” landed at the top of the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question Turkmen Islamic movement
"The behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and West Asia," the Chinese security chief told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted online on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC), spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has appointed a particular organization after Monday’s attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the Muslim-dominated Xinjiang region, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their gasoline-loaded car against the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing in a suicide attack that killed two people and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among al-Qaeda-affiliated organizations.
The movement is often referred to by Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The breakup of Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are being warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along the wall of Hadrian.
While it is true that Strathclyde’s newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU member states spend much of their time bypassing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continued non-compliance with the rules would be a slim concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scots.
So this is a story that is not one.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I first heard the bobard that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
Yet we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitively deadlocked.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties that oppose the EU or advocate for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and removed the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the heavy burden on national economies through single currency membership, has led many people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments registering excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has forced on its members favorable exchange rates for German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of Southern Europe end up with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper unease related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a cost inconvenience, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage freezes in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is raging, especially in France, one of the EU’s great leaders.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy struggling.
As a result, Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial by-election, returning the Socialists to power in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split on the right will automatically favor the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with her new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single, anti-European anti-currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency sentiment unique in Europe will unite and will eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will more closely resemble the free “Europe of (sovereign) nations” privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will make its eyes soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending out walking Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate itself to a freer European agreement provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
Scotland’s SNP government is – and it’s worth noting – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Aging Early
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes don’t mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts think obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter’s breasts and pubic hair start to grow at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, pedo-endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general, it doesn’t indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as breast buds, hair under the arms and in the pubic area, and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first menstrual period over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, compared to 12 years three quarters in 1970.
“Once the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first menstrual period appears,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will evolve.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered “early” when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution may justify tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first menstrual period and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow down growth and a small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate, and affective maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs but acknowledges that “controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have their periods.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at age 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school frightened and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories made known to the public about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, the chemicals present in the environment, or the sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years that linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the pubic area younger, the tendency towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be cautious about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls with early puberty should be reassured that even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.
Tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that just began to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, had garnered the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Failing to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen set their sights on rising star Oscar Isaac, 33, as well as pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be an accomplished musician and folk singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan’s rich stitches in “Gatsby the Magnificent” for less glamorous clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but swears at the machine gun when she speaks.
“Inside Llewyn Davis” tells a week-long story about the tribulations of a folk singer who can’t break through and gets angry with the whole world.
He accepts to back up the replacements at the raised foot in the studios.
Without housing, he tours the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
“His relationship with success is tortured, that’s what interested us: a mix of bad luck, a guy who’s not there at the right time, who’s not careerist but integrity, with self-destructive behavior,” Coen told reporters.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fan filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the time such as folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich Village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would engender international stars" as written by journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes on the look of documentary, from the dusty music label invaded by unsold 33T inhabited by an old unpaid secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and to the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character that goes through the film constantly: a beautiful red cat with a crackling eye, Llewyn Davis's lucky companion.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grown up in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country."
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar,” he said.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary to “be considered good,” “random can also launch someone’s career,” and “increasingly today.”
As Llewyn Davis refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, “the most important thing is not to get caught up in anything that can stop us from expressing ourselves.”
Gérard de Villiers, the author of SAS, has died.
He will never know the word retirement.
French edition phenomenon, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times called him “the author of spy novels who knew too much.”
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theater of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically diminished by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was traveling during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, ensured to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
“Without a doubt between 120 and 150 million all countries combined,” he said in March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment on Foch Avenue, a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, his mischievous eye under his white hair, cited some of the languages in which SAS's adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivories reported from the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his most serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, Austrian aristocrat and contract agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, goes on the hunt for all the villains of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
“I never claimed to be a literary author,” Gérard de Villiers said.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked “like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert Londres, who went there and came back with real, long investigations.”
SAS's father used to say "make a kind of geopolitical soap opera."
“I am constantly on my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I leave,” added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those from AFP, diplomats, people from the services that I have known for some twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often predictive: a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way to Damascus".
In “The Mad Men of Benghazi,” he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadate in The Cairo Conspiracy, a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in Panic in Bamako, he recounted the columns of 4X4 jihadists who were based in the Malian capital.
I’m not guessing, defended Gérard de Villiers, I just make hypotheses from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my hypotheses come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he would set up for a month behind his 1976 daisy IBM typewriter "whose parts were all changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "END" and corrected each page with a pen.
On the walls of his office hang AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, smart and brave women.
I am always welcome in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said it: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not of age".
He will not die or retire.
No more than I do.
Aircraft manufacturers quarrel over seat width while large controls are at stake
The dispute rages among major aeronautical manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at this month’s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seats offered on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers – which are not always the most courted by airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its major U.S. rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as aircraft manufacturers seek to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record-breaking order at the November 17-21 event.
The way seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, whether there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is critical to the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its refurbished 777X will accommodate 406 people in economy class seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people into economy class in 18-inch-wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often trade shots on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were able to realize recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Would you accept this?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ chief commercial officer.
As eating habits change, people get bigger, but the seats in airplanes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing’s jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American’s weight from 40 to 49 increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average 21st-century American’s waist circumference is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a seat concept dating back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named jet set was narrower.
Airbus said it had commissioned a study that said an extra inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ seat width figures and says it’s not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says the study shows that cabin experience doesn’t just depend on seat width.
“It’s really about making airlines more flexible and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to run their business,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s Passenger Satisfaction Manager.
They do not want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it’s more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it’s increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to order planes for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seat configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a per-seat performance in their latest long-haul twin-engine models that is 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 configured in rows of 9.
The gain in unit costs is small compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing does this to make more seats available and to make its aircraft more competitive with our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Director of Passenger Comfort at European airline Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is driven by the 777 threat,” said Mary Kirby, cabin interiors expert, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft vendors who travel around the world even take a metre with them to check competing configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider side-by-side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that its call to the aviation industry to set a size standard for seats will succeed, but that it could make forget the sales wave of the 777X.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the proposed remuneration for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, in light of his group’s financial performance.
The vote is not binding, but it tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the third fortune of his ship's victory in the America's Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison received a negative vote on his pay.
The Oracle boss forfeited a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group’s poor performance, which failed to meet its growth targets, but he raised about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire off-balance-sheet 2013, Oracle’s net profit rose by 3.5% while the stock market price jumped by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which picked up 24% at the same time.
New Nicotine Vaccine Could Suppress Smoking Pleasure
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice for life from nicotine addiction.
More tests are needed before human trials begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a steady flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track down all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his dose of nicotine.
In the tests, vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated “were soothed,” the researchers said, indicating that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have proven ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and inconvenient.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it could help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, security officials said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in the strike in the North-Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike," a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, informed the British government that talks had begun with Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state’s anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the trade lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid owns two restaurants and a coffee shop, after they expired in August 2005 without any tenders.
It is now investigating allegations that Tripodi was aware of Obeid’s secret interest in these properties, following testimony from Tripodi’s former deputy secretary general Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government has been pushing for the leases to be the subject of a tender.
Tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay companies, which earned the Obeid approximately $2.5 million per year, were renewed without any tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid who, Tripodi acknowledged, was calling for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented at ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the development of the policy on commercial leases?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we discussed, but at least it wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify who the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has conducted airstrikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass an “authentication” test
The government is currently considering setting up an “authentication” test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa as it plans to extend enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion intended to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unskilled positions or as a hijacked means to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government’s speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“The chilling statements about ‘foreigners coming back at the end of the line’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant comeback at a time when unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labor had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The working paper outlines the 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others under review.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to find out “whether the job offer is genuine in the event that the candidate is a relationship or a personal partner of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring company”.
Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man’s frightened 9-year-old son was traveling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father passed away Wednesday from an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study aimed at multiplying the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the British government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “would bring the UK together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to consider strengthening rail capacity and improving journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our focus for HS2 is on a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we are facing a capacity problem in our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support “unequivocally” the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to deliver considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight to the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
“So we’re excited to be working in partnership with the UK government to explore options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for everyone and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps.”
Rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to relax regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in “airplane” mode.
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it painful to not be able to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
The Australian carriers are reviewing the decision requiring U.S. carriers to do significant work to comply with the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures in the immediate future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in airplanes,” she said.
The issue is subject to regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained on an ongoing basis and passengers to comply with safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has previously told CASA of her intention to expand the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change but said she would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA overhaul that would allow the use of electronic devices because we truly believe that it would improve the customer experience now that we have (in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said it is currently complying with the current rules.
“According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change that in the immediate future,” she said.
The FAA’s decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA’s decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing manuals, training materials, carry-on programs and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under seats or in upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a fight involving several people broke out on the side of the Post.
At least four minor injuries were reported.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore pledge lenders take advantage of middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawn shop at the Bendemeer mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga drops a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for her daughters’ tuition.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, this week became the third pawnbroker to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Auctioning jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in Ms. Amirthalinga’s case – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore pawnbroker borrows an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawn lenders have the advantage of not requesting a credit check or proof of pay, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers as families feel the pressure of rising cost of living and the over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pledged lenders to bridge the gap as their economies slow down.
This week, the ratings agency Standard & Poor’s cited rising household debt, mainly stemming from rising mortgage lending, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest debt-to-gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about Thailand’s high level of consumer debt, which recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [of the wage scale] are looking to supplement their income as much as they can,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people rush to pledge their personal belongings to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items sold in the city-state’s 200 leasing shops are made of gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pledge Grandma's gold chain and we'll be back for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest leasing shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
ValueMax, which operates the store in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says its CEO.
The company will fund them by using 60% of the $66 million it raised this week at its Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have been criticized for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah says that pledges not only offer lower rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
“Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property doesn’t increase household debt,” she says.
Pledge placement is increasingly socially accepted as a means of securing guaranteed short-term funding.
People who go to pawnbrokers aren’t just those who have financial problems either.
Wealthy Singaporeans also go to ValueMax pawnshops to pawn gold bars or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“It can be wealthy people who need to borrow for short-term business or investment, or small businesses who have cash needs to go a tough road,” adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor charged with child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for young people in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches of his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was officiating, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, they must not communicate with people under the age of 18 and do not have access to the Internet.
He will appear in the provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in a Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being hunted.
A man in a Nazi uniform barred from a cuff with the swastika cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the establishment that called police, the store said Friday.
“We received several complaints from customers, so we asked her to leave the store,” a spokeswoman for supermarket chain Asda said.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "the time it came, he had already gone without an explosion," she added.
I was standing in line when I saw a woman who looked upset.
People were mouthed.
"You don't go out on the street like that unless you want to get attention," Rosina Rusin, a 60-year-old client, told the Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
“I’ve been wearing a black SS armband twice a week for three years at Asda,” Dutton said, explaining that he was suffering from “mental problems.”
$325 million bailout plan for Tasmanian health care system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout plan for the faltering health care system comes with strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking “urgent action” to end a crisis caused by the aging population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The four-year funding was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgery.
An additional 2,600 operations, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataracts, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for Hobart and Launceston clinics without appointments, improved external care, training of medical executives, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to first-line clinicians, this is the best way to care for Tasmania’s health care system,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will have to maintain its current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much “unless it is followed by genuine reform to consolidate Tasmania’s public health system.”
However, he commended the government for responding to the urgent request for assistance he submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania’s public health system from the blacklist,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “solution of fortune.”
“The reason we’re here is that the state’s Labour government withdrew $430 million from its health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government pulling out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth putting in $300 million, and pretend it's a great day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts remarkable artistic direction and meticulous period reconstruction, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Higher Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never gets into lubricity or sensationalism, and that’s the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria Destroys Chemical Weapons Production Capacity, Monitor Says
Syria destroyed critical equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day ahead of the deadline of
The Hague-based organization ordered Damascus to destroy or “make unusable” all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
Completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timeline to destroy Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start destroying existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the city of Sapphira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The group, which tracks the human record through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, an estimated 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, of whom 18,678 were fighters from pro-government forces and 187 from Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, an estimated 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She has not updated this figure since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad’s troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to groups in the al-Qaeda network in Sapphira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any clarification.
The fighting underscored the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission of clearing Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a protracted civil war.
A statement from the OPCW, which is working closely with the UN, said its team was “now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all of the critical production declared and the machines intended for mixing and filling.”
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the time being."
Earlier in the week, the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to safety concerns, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that was approved by the OPCW Executive Committee the following month.
“I salute the moral strength and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the organization’s Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits Sunni Muslim rebels against the government of el-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there had been a heavy explosion Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger over punishment of one of the Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution platoon.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass killing for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He has also been convicted of numerous other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have asked for a life sentence, but they could have asked that the man, described as “Demolition Man” for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men.
“He should be dragged in front of the firing squad,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he “died” three times while under respiratory assistance.
Hugues said Patek should have experienced the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terror cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He did not surrender,” Corteen added.
Until recently, he laughed wildly at the grief he had caused to other people.
The verdict came on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” Corteen said.
Patek, however, can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board planes (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from door to door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phones – under the highly anticipated new directives released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will need to prove to the FAA that their aircraft are complying with the new directives and that they have updated crew member training manuals and aircraft storage rules to comply.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them back on until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when the plane descends before landing and not turn them back on until the plane has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with these changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers for that – it will benefit everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “room overseers” when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be banned from connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will need to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices into airplane mode.
So there is still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was ejected at high noise from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the plane was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always need to be stowed up as they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
Regulatory power over mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said cell phones were still considered risky.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could eventually create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile relay antennas if used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronics.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce as device use has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
New airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also better resist interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices typically emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only emit minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for easing restrictions on passengers’ use of electronic devices.
In 2011, the company’s executives loaded a airliner of Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the planes was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that the aircraft can interfere with the systems of an aircraft, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense arrangements for travelers equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, hailed after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
Water was flown on a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before it was put back on its feet by the Scottish SPCA at its Alloa rescue centre.
The director of the center, Colin Seddon, said: “This water creek was probably a wintering migrant who came from Northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of strong winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help.”
The water was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and define what wealth and jobs creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes, sectors and regions of the UK.
The findings of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and expanding while EU states are stagnant.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than getting stuck in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcana.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue its efforts to change the treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This conclusion, which can be found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the corporate world insists on a “significant change” that restores power to the UK.
The stakes are high – succeeding in changing the treaty and better representing Britain’s interests would lead to a 16% rollover of votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of UK companies, as the euro area is moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels’ regulatory approach.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not departed from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he handed out treats to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were canceled due to Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the party has caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people took part in the parade organized in the "Greenwich Village" neighborhood.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned for last year.
We have fun like crazy, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
It's a good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says Bulgaria’s gas pipeline ushers in a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, said Gazprom’s director.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, Europe’s largest large-scale project,” Alexei Miller, Gazprom’s chief executive, said in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his counterpart in Ukraine, through which most Russian gas transits to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director added.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is commissioned in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
Pitcairn Island wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, the Tahiti News daily reported Thursday, capturing news from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty, still inhabit Pitcairn, and their income depends 95% on the generosity of London.
The Island Council unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836,000 km2 that correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
An assistant mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The bill must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, New Zealand, and the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify this 836,000 km2, provided that it has the means to ensure its monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already conduct the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesia EEZ, neighboring Pitcairn.
The FAA has eased restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board planes – but it will still be banned from making calls on mobile phones.

Life imprisonment for a former Vice-Governor of China
A former deputy governor of northeast China’s Jilin province was sentenced Friday to life in prison for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of hitting more than 19 million yuan in bribes, Chinese official media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also the president of Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped businesses and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing’s first interim court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, saying the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state has promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the junior officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted, among them former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced for life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest offices in the state.
But the government has in no way expressed its intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, a party-independent body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault over allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales were charged with sexual assaults against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a YMCA physical education instructor Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children at the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was inaccurate in pointing out, “external checks of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-worst ratings on four establishments during a Quality Audit by the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that personnel management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.
Staff testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them private, made them sit on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was mentored by Lord and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found YMCA Caringbah’s children’s services manager, Jacqui Barnat, to be mentoring Lord “very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time.”
The Director General said that he rejected the staff's testimonies that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their hierarchical superior.
Instead, he said that the friendly relationships they had with Lord had blurred their judgment, so they did not report his actions.
Hare said he had expressed his views before the YMCA board in New South Wales saying that for the organization, the lesson from the “Jonathan Lord incident” should not be about “reporting” by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by YMCA’s Director General for Children’s Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an “excess of zeal” and that it had been improperly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith before the Commission.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruiting, monitoring, initiating, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledged his return was unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since leaving in June 2007 after a decade as head of the country, Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet’s special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of prime minister, Blair reportedly replied, according to London’s Evening Standard: “Yes, of course, but it may probably happen, so...”
When many equestrian event experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old boy, win.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted during the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparables – who are the same size – were hailed for their presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Posing against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side casually to scroll his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton has been hailed by judges for his unusual natural training qualities for a child his age.
And Toffee received very good marks for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for her 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with her Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great duo.”
They presented themselves to and against all, but both snatched the gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were insane of the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, “There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging and applauding her.”
He ran the entire length of the track and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he’ll surely be participating in the Horse of the Year event soon – and I’m sure he’ll be doing a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian rally said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They are a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee were performing well and the way they paraded on the track.
They’re looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he looked really good.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call “will be overhauled”
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be recast, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express published a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete overhaul,” the regulator said.
The order for "reshaping" came from the Guangdon administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“New Express’s writing was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided to “impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete reshuffle of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation of those responsible at New Express and immediately reshuffle the newspaper’s management team.”
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express about alleged financial irregularities from a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing fake stories for money.
"In this case, I have hurt Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to win the public's trust," he told public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen’s apology, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made television confessions.
Experts say people are routinely forced to make their confessions, despite a change in law that was passed earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on the raft.
The leak of radioactive steam detected on one of the two nuclear boilers of the Charles-de-Gaulle, in mid-October and while the boat was at sea, was "safe for sailors", but is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royal Navy has confirmed to us the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a specialist in the defense naval, assures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
For them, among other things, it is a question of changing a pump on the failing boiler.
“Everything is being done so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013,” DCNS said.
And the National Navy certifies that "it does not in any way jeopardize the program of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
Recall that the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle comes out of a six-month interim maintenance period.
He had sailed from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young fighter pilots.
A "small breakdown", limited to the confinement space of the reactor, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year now, I have been able to see a lot of dissatisfaction from the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to never end.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dollars squandered could be saved in order to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major businesses, there is no problem with sumptuous spending and the maintenance of lame ducks: a deficit cultural center, a large subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private enterprise or demolish them.
It is also heartbreaking to see the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention of the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to the tax payers?
It is not for the public to invest in such companies, but for the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the Fishing and Pile Lakes will continue to supply the city with clean water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water users) and the large population decline, water use has declined significantly throughout the territory.
Not to mention wasting it, the city will never run out of water and strict regulations on its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We’ve been run for over 40 years by tie-ups with pretty degrees for the most part, and I don’t think a sheep farmer does any worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities have described the 4-by-3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging over a length equivalent to nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, making it easy to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who authorities said were working as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major crossing discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels who must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard passageway equipped with railroad tracks that left the kitchen of a Tijuana home and went up to two San Diego warehouses.
British Police Issue Extradition Warrant Against Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London and requested political asylum.
Scotland Yard said she had issued a “deferral notice” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at a police station, adding that if he didn’t, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sex crime, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court overturned the appeal he filed against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asked him to appear at a police station, at the date and time of his choice,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, having unveiled more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting against secret information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
Are you done typing passwords to access your smartphone or pay for purchases?
American, French and Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Morpho's deputy general manager, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person transacting in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Privacy organizations confirm this craze for biometrics, but worry about it.
In 2011 and in France alone, the Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone can soon be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques that will enable new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most commonly used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
“For example, some people who work in concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible,” said Philippe Robin, technical director of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - one cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a drawback: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for some twenty years on other approaches, such as recognition of the face or iris (the colored part of the eye).
By increasing the accuracy of sensors and computing capacity of computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
Accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, says Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s European R&D labs.
With our help, the UK and Holland have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but it takes a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
A unique and unfalsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
“As the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data,” confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Foresight at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers forensic police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who they claim to be).
The identification so far concerned the issuance of identity papers: we must compare the biometric elements (fingerprints, photo, iris) with the information that the state has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to impersonate someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or a store.
“We are retrieving images from surveillance cameras and comparing them to photos of celebrities who are freely circulating on the Internet,” explains Dany Nassif, head of business development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Another use: take a picture of a queuing quidam in a store, track its progress through facial recognition, and calculate the wait time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control was added.
"One biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend pointing to another," explains Cyrille Bataller of Accenture.
But, more and more, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the keystroke of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and in Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in-store with his credit card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tips to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the box thirty seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
“Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people’s identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure case, which is blocked if you try to move it,” said Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, due to the lack of in-depth research, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts, however, continue to be concerned.
“The advances in facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was inflicted with an almond of 1,000 pounds.
A motorist was fined 1,000 pounds for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to be taken between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn on his license led to a 6-month license withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of 90 pounds and a victim surcharge of 100 pounds.
A Tax on Foreign Property Owners to Break the London Bubble
The Treasury has provisionally figured the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who, in Budget 2012, entered a 7% stamp duty for properties costing more than $2 million and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own properties within a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea boroughs, and represents 708 million euros in fiscal year 2012/13, exceeding the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Cook said: “Following the increase in the stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the outdated housing tax system.”
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10 percent of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector southwest of London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8 percent over the past year.
Prices in central London grew steadily year-on-year by 5.6% but were overshadowed by a growing "domestic market", with the city's southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) experiencing a recovery, according to Savills' studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how a dog’s tail movements are related to his mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs moved their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to see what was happening with other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the animals’ heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented dogs with films of other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other factors of confusion – and we were able to trade the tail movement and present it as going more to the left or to the right.”
When the animals saw an unexpressed dog move the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog that moves the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail diverting mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog stirring the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, he thinks dogs know by experience what movements they should or shouldn’t worry about.
He added: “If you repeatedly meet other dogs and notice that most of the time their tail movement to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience.”
The researchers say the findings could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their animals’ emotions.
Canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol’s School of Veterinary Sciences, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs were easier going towards a robot dog when its tail was moving to the left rather than the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study.”
He said the differences could come from the fact that the dogs that participated in the different studies did not fully consider the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Although many elements, collected from different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner disease
Arctic Monkeys postponed a gig in Glasgow after their singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield's band was scheduled to perform Friday at The Hydro concert hall in downtown.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement came after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys are also expected to postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will take place on November 21.
All tickets are valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologise to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis to appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest placed churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so that amounts to a group of 120 “cardinal electors.”
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held ahead of the ceremony during which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will likely have declined.
He said that a pope usually appointed as many cardinals as needed for the number of cardinal electors to reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year’s consistory will be important as it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope decided on his own.
“From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was "quite possible" for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we’ve never experienced such a situation – it’s totally new.
Valero said the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will appoint.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to fix the seat back
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to fix a problem with manually tiltable cases, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a fault in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit from the rear, the head restraint may not protect passengers properly, increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the newsletter to owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s stock price climbed 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday morning in Montreal.
The drama occurred around 11 a.m., on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie borough.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been going on here for some time.
An adjoining foundation wall had just been erected in recent days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the construction site to retrieve his tools.
I was driving by and saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We could only see part of his back, it was so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a formwork company.
Reanimation manoeuvres were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Workplace Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
Obama's voter's cry of despair
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change.
He says Obama made laudable efforts thwarted by Republican Party obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I’m reading a very sad book these days.
It’s a book that, I thought, would encourage me during my second year of medicine and give me hope.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s the memoirs of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical records at night and went to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended with a landslide victory and news anchors took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% favorable views.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it’s like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our army from Iraq, through the end of the “neither seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in immigration reform, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after many times defending Obama’s administration in front of my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the verge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks on innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the impeachment of whistleblowers who reveal the government’s wrongdoing.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the exceeding of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
She cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive...since the Nixon administration.”
And more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all of the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the administration's choice.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative that did not seem to be able to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that have been heard for so long.
Yet, while the favorable opinion index has plunged below 45% this week, it’s even harder to get back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me crave the many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primary.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to focus on our talent,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We're five years later, Mr. President, and I don't agree with you anymore.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite rapid rescue intervention, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of it.
The mining tycoon, who disputes the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has argued this argument in an attempt to dismiss questions about a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Palmer said only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said Abbott’s daughters were willing to personally benefit from those policies.
“He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Palmer won the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of a redesign of the voting system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can’t we have a system where you can enter, enter your details in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered options for electronic voting and recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and would take his new duties “very seriously.”
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We’re not looking for a reward except for the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new humpback dolphin species off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientific mission officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Environments (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
That's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
While in the past species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of species classification.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are questioned due to advances in genetics.
Similarly, two closely related morphological species have been distinguished by genetics.
This is the case for the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this a significant discovery as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or bycatch arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than the local disappearance of a population of a species more widespread on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered based on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e., the stock, and its ability to recover from neighbouring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the newly discovered species originated, its stock automatically became weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene pooling limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well known.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than know what lives in the Mariana Trench, only 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on the search for life on other planets than we do on marine research, and it’s time for that to change.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the case, showing once again that the global investigation by regulators into suspicions of currency market manipulations is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in surveys of the world’s largest financial market, where US$5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said RBS had forwarded files of emails and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European spot trader for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Citi’s European head of spot currency trading, was laid off this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr. Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of currency market manipulations at a number of Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations made about bankers who have agreed to manipulate rates in the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the case said.
Banks scrutinize instant messages and emails sent for years to find instances of wrongdoing.
News of these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers of investment banking trading units in recent years, but has been called into question this year due to the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start having a low-cost impact on the market.”
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader working at its London Stock Exchange trading fund office this week after it caused a $6 million loss late last year.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was controlled,” said a representative of Credit Suisse.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation has been skewed, says lawyer
After police confirmed they had gotten a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Clayton Ruby claimed he had never seen an investigation “so flawed.”
Ruby told The Canadian Press that police had “ignored or minimized” the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford’s friend and occasional driver, 35-year-old Alexander Lisi, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also watched the man deliver packages to Rob Ford, new court documents say.
Ruby called it “inexplicable” that police had never searched Rob Ford’s vehicle or his home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Chief of Police Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford’s vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search – even without a warrant.
She could also have requested an instant search warrant if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Mr. Ruby’s remarks an “obvious and desperate attempt” to assert himself to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a news conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" for a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock exchanges down by mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are down by mid-session on Friday, led by some news of disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
Investors remain cautious as they believe the U.S. Federal Reserve could roll back its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could soften its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures predict an uptick in U.S. stocks after two consecutive downturns.
At values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline of the CAC 40, led by the profit warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) is EuroFirst300’s worst performance, after also posting lower earnings this morning and announcing the internal creation of a “bad bank” with 38 billion pounds of riskier assets.
Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the forefront of EuroFirst300 increases in response to news that AT&T is considering a potential bid.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB’s monetary policy is going well, as John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank, testifies.
The ECB’s single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week’s meeting.
We are anticipating a strong potential for the euro to fall.
In this context, the euro continues its retreat against the US currency and reached a two-week low at $1.3517.
These same conjectures support the euro area bond market inversely.
Supreme Court upholds Obama’s health care reform law
Big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared Obama’s health care reform law constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, under penalty of having to pay a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government’s tax power.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four most liberal members of the court, while Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page Act and found that the provision in the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the threshold for Medicaid eligibility should be lowered or all federal funding for the program should be lost, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican presidential candidates running in the 2012 primary, including nominee Mitt Romney, have fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to soldiers and the dead of all wars this Friday afternoon.
Sheep were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Deputy Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Israeli-Palestinian hanging at Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday evening in a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The Gaza Strip's only power plant ceased operation on Friday after its fuel stockpiles ran out, the Palestinian enclave's energy authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another member of the Hamas armed wing, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell fire during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer raided 100 meters into the territory before then withdrawing.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zouhri paid tribute to the four “heroes” and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the Al-Qassam heroes who fell while defending the territory during an incursion by the Zionist occupier into Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be hell for the occupier," the spokesman said.
For its part, the Israeli army said that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas has claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, saying the goal was to kidnap Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting IDF forces and wounded five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," Army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
Israel also struck an air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported on Thursday.
A U.S. official confirmed an “Israeli strike” but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing “exclusive sources” that she did not name, the Saudi-owned chain said that “the bombing targeted a cargo of ground-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon,” referring to the powerful Lebanese Shia movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard Wednesday at dawn at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
The organization, which relied on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the source of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopedias de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from ink black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, advances, in profile, thin as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple trait, takes its form.
And this shape will be that of the whole piece: a row of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only their hands and face uncovered, waiting on either side of the playing area, rush when the next spelling appears, embody it, run out.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is done in solo relays, in unison group (a mass that does solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
One thinks of "Glory of the Morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online in the foreground.
It is the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prior takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux’s poem, monotonous and monotonous in the scream, and continues dancing.
And the music to leave, and the sequence to resume.
This loud and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up stunning and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - image creation has always been a strength at Chouinard - like those swirling hair or those black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has prevailed, with her tics.
The result: the bodies seem flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’s inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a wider, more porous imaginary than dance.
Only the end, in the negative, with its dancers chopped by strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches the magic.
The audience liked it, the welcome was warm.
Gymnopedia, after the intermission, is richer.
The stage is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a neglected house.
On the piano, dancers turn around to play the scores.
Their clumsiness in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffons appear, also familiar to Chouinard, with a red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnassiers, fugitives or gamblers.
The gesture, the laughter and the little screams beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of bodies in coitus, of beings that merge.
But the piece takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored overlap, the cabotin dancers descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness perspire, and it is Chouinard's art there to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei face lawsuit over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of old Nortel patents, began an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it helmed at the post during the patent auction that took place after Nortel’s bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow advertising to be displayed in relation to search terms on the Internet, the findings of the lawsuit said, which is Google’s core business.
It was not possible to reach the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which is fiercely competing with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offering several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel’s patents to Rockstar, Google later acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market based in part on Motorola’s patent library.
“Although it failed to acquire the patents at issue during the auction, Google violated and continues to violate the said patents,” the lawsuit’s findings said.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google because it claims Google’s patent infringement is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater causing the explosion
Grandmother allegedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a home in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a defective water heater, said Friday night the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The expert dispatched by the prosecutor's office ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a buildup of gas.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his partner, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU of Liège, she by helicopter, him by ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet, who came down on the scene.
Traumatized, Grandpa was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters from Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to take oath
Mohamed Morsi has taken the inauguration oath, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he swore the inauguration of the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the Court’s 18 black-robed judges whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We aspire to better tomorrows, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to applaud the new president and, standing out from the presidential splendor of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic “relief wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown considerably since his victory and Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mohamed Morsi said, wearing a blue suit and red tie, speaking to judges in the wooded hall where he was sworn in.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his investiture speech.
He was officially greeted by a military fanfare who played the national anthem as he stood guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the chant “The people and the army, hand in hand...” sung by thousands of people gathered in the university’s large amphitheater.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year began, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers whose military council, which replaced the ousted former president, dispossessed him.
But by agreeing to officially swear an oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi’s speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The US shutdown slowed the rise of the auto market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal administrations weighed on growth in U.S. car sales in October, according to figures released Friday by automakers, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
Detroit's top three automakers posted double-digit growth from October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million sales at a seasonally adjusted annualized pace, but the market was 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to customers of the bank, he believes that this slight slowdown is primarily explained by "the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month".
GM reported an increase of nearly 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, up from 211,563 expected by consensus.
The four brands of the group have seen their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups, saw sales increase by 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while consensus was waiting for 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted below-consensus sales, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM stock earned 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford ceded 1.1%.
Renault on stock market due to Nissan warning
On Friday, Renault saw the sharpest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor said it had cut its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20 percent.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a revision, also announced a reshuffle of its management.
Several traders reported that Renault stock was affected by the “warning” this morning.
“It’s clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” said one head of trading at a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan’s capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data from Nissan’s website.
Greece: Two dead in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another seriously injured on Friday night by shots fired by two people on a motorcycle passing by a neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party premises in the western suburbs of Athens, a police source said.
The police were not yet able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police from the counter-terrorism service rushed to the central avenue of the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six deputies of Golden Dawn, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two matches of his club's Champions League, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Barça for targeting Neymar, the Scottish midfielder has seen his suspension extended to three games by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are without electricity across the province shortly after noon Friday, due to high winds affecting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers plunged into the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The greater Montreal area is also experiencing its share of power outages with nearly 7,000 private households in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised its net earnings forecast upwards and expects record results from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit for the entire year between $325 million and $340 million before taxes, compared with a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12-17% growth from the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
Chief Executive Officer Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8% profits in the first half and the second half had started strong, particularly with regard to non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we operate are profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results over the entire fiscal year before deducting interest and taxes,” he said.
This applies to Australia and the UK, which are usually the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure travel sector has performed well while business customers have spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half when seasonal demand was lower and was expected to make a profit for the full year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to reach $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns shoot at a hotel near the Cairo pyramids
Unknown hooded men opened fire on Friday at a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt with no casualties, a result of an apparent quarrel with laid-off employees.
The attackers fled, Interior Ministry spokesman General Abdel Latif said.
The attack comes as Egypt hasn’t received any tourists since the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and crushed the protests of his supporters in blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of the English literature classes, students will have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem, and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also introduce "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be discontinued.
Starting in 2015, students will need to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to release its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year.
Additionally, Ofqual, the Examination Regulatory Office, will unveil a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new scoring system and fewer courses.
Speaking this summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was “a broad consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public trust,” stressing that GCSEs would be “more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singaporean students do about 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the in-depth math GCSE – as well as the increased emphasis on subjects in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more class hours.
The program will focus more on "real-world problems", including financial mathematics.
This ruling means that a law passed in July in that state that broadly calls into question the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
A 80-year-old welcomes children with a Muy rifle for Halloween
The 9- and 13-year-olds went door-to-door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door holding his shotgun.
The 86-year-old man told the police he was afraid.
His gun was seized.
Former Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without a trace, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
“His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte,” he told the daily newspaper in large print, relying on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime, would answer one of the great puzzles of the post-war period.
The German secret service, the BND, assured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was totally wrong.
"From August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," Tuchel said.
He was wearing a “general uniform.”
“In the left inner pocket were notably his working conditions with a photo,” he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from Berlin’s Mitte district town hall stating that he was buried in the neighborhood’s Jewish cemetery.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
For one of the most brutal Nazi sadists to be buried in a Jewish cemetery is a distasteful enormity.
"The memory of the victims is grossly swept up," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the most important figures in the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and was led by Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle Delivers Free Health Care in Cameroonian Villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend most of their weekends seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect "CNN Hero of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that weren’t equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma from which he would carry the aftermath for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so he could get any treatment he could get.
“It’s not easy,” added Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 o'clock, rush to the hospital to be first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health expenditures are made in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 surgeries for free over the past year.
He became a physician himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas over the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they pile up in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and traversing difficult terrain to reach the villages that need help most.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
Many times they had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available housing.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people at each visit,” Mr. Bwelle said.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a collected pair of glasses or a free birth certificate – a necessary document to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school, a town hall or a house; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes to the wake-up room to give his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s a grueling pace, but village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
“They’re hitting drums all night long to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 free surgeries over the past year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference to those they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to running this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical practices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, that finances its association to 60%; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O’Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it’s an opportunity for field learning that they don’t have at home.
“We were able to participate in operations to help sponge the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,” explained Ms. O’Malley.
It’s not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you’re a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt about it,” said Katie O’Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others live happily by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons I do this.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheaters and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but highlighting its weakness for the crossroads, Sciences-Po, the High Schools.
Referee of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publisher.
Heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Certainly, but knowing that such a sacred cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, from which it happened.
They readily recognized him as a great awakener, animator and federator of their work, but remarked that he was unwilling to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked tongues have seen a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent, scholarly but incurably amateur commentator.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who passed for not writing had much and well written.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
Yet once again we find there the temptation of ubiquity, the intellectual vagabondage, the jubilation set to jump like feet joined from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring back the brocanteur to one and the same passion: that of discovering the node constitutive of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: This is a period concern.
A short time ago, we were collectively asked to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our then-leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and subprefects, authorized interpreters.
The one Pierre Nora is chasing is quite different.
He does not pose as heir to an eternal franchise, he refuses to define it.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of a rebus, tormented by annoying questions.
Of which this one, which is born from the company itself: why, in a country so long established within its borders, so formerly framed and solidly bricked, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are only so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, to defuse the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits the national history in two.
Since the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without being able to deny it; on the contrary, anxious to regain its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility that it had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this uniqueness of French identity feel, nothing beats the four steps out of Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora’s American escape might well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousinage only emphasizes better what is proper to us.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men cluttered with an ancient indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here it sowed drama and confit.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors who are difficult to model, and who have killed each other.
There is an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, as so many mistakes to be made and trials to be resumed.
The France that is coming, the France that is coming
There was, however, a time when the French believed they could sew the ripped dress of their history, and defeat the curse of number two.
In this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France was darkly preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity has only had a time.
It is once again being debated, shaken by a new kind of immigration, threatened by the rise of self-serving minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France going away and the circumspect sketch of France coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
It was discovered that the chimney was a casserole.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The edge walker stood in the center of the center.
And the one who had submitted, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of nation, but had withdrawn from the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will have ended up doing it.
Surely in a less steep, more blasted and more subtle form.
But let us not be mistaken, which is equally binding.
Because much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: 'Return is quite complex to manage'
Kidnapped in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defense association "Hostages of the World", which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for hostages to file a complaint and bring their hostage-taking to the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, a former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hostages du monde".
On the evening of your release, you were on the set of the 20h of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
Especially in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's dark. - Roger Auque
He tells me "we're freed," but I'm not sure, and he tells me that we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but also very tense.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the website of the Hotel Summerland where the press is present.
The French take us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a T-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Easter boards.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We landed in Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, is here.
It's a bit brutal.
There's an incredible hustle.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and there's plenty of them.
The descent of the flight staircase, the reunions with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and me, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorcyclists take the brunt of taking pictures and follow me home where I have to do a little police work to prevent some from getting up.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We come out of a hole and suddenly we're under the media spotlight.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest thing.
In the evening I am at 8:00, the next day I am also on TV.
Then begin a kind of rehabilitation to life, very gently, for a month or two that is a bit like a vacation.
How were the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing?
I had my first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done at the Val-de-Grâce the days after my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on it, remember it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
That's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostages.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four Niger hostages?
I'm listening to what's said.
In particular, the issue of ransoms.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I’m trying to share things between questions about my past as a hostage and my cap as president of the “Hostages of the World” association that allows me to put some distance, and I find it much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, along with others, for the recognition of the hostage's legal status.
I think there is a semantic problem.
The taking of hostages must be described as "political" - which is the case most of the time - and allow hostages access to justice, to file a complaint and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is for that.
Why would we not say to the hostage-gatherers, "You have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
Yet it seems to me justified, legitimate, struck by common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the street to denounce Morsi trial
Anger grows in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of the fallen president Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization across Egypt to call for the restoration of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, says this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet with him and no volunteers have been able to take a copy of the documents of the case.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a fake trial insurgent pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to bring Sisi to justice, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas and 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to a Defense Department ID card and the benefits that come with it," the minister recalled in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League on fighting anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of federal law.
The nine-state sling began in Texas, which refuses to implement these benefits on Texas National Guard facilities, due to a conflict between Texas law and the federal gay marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage at about 5,600 active people, 17,000 including the National Guard, the Reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2nd at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration takes place on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the awards ceremony at 4 p.m.
The audience will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young Hyerois prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he likes nothing more than to show off to competitors who surpass him by three heads.
Toronto Mayor chases journalists to question him on drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of taking drugs, according to several media outlets.
A video sent to court seems to support these suspicions.
Rob Ford has always denied using crack, while acknowledging he has a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he expelled several journalists from his property who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes images don’t need explanation or commentary.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced Thursday that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
“An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of people who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28,” the ministry said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The ministries are now calling people who were bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin damaged by this kitten or whose pet was in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"Since France has been free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not unharmed," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "Aboriginal" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France was declared officially free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies against a dog illegally imported from the Gambia was recorded in 2008.
“Rabies is a deadly disease if not treated in time,” the ministry said, and it was transmissible for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appeared.
Obama backtracks on health care reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that “if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president over the past few days accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his promise of origin.
“The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “a buzz in the news” about terminations, President Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better adapted health plans for the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You will win,” he said.
The Administration has announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who take out their own insurance are forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me address these Americans directly: You deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius said during her testimony before the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the October launch of the online marketplace had failed “unfortunately.”
“I’m as frustrated and angry as anyone,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this phrase, as she believed her coupé, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday’s Assembly meeting following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, Missouri’s Republican representative, on whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Long insistently asked Ms. Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to take out a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now sells to millions of Americans.
Vettel wins a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happily elected Jake Vite Prekop combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and warmth at the track level.
Sebastian Vettel, a four-time Formula 1 world champion from Germany, made a special helmet for free practice at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday, designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen from 1,500 designs sent from around the world, as part of a contest launched by one of the sponsors, an automotive brand, of its stable.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and so can see closely the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, testing.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, destined to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Let us not be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the suburbs" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I have chosen a map of France as the logo, he justifies.
When I speak of suburbs, I speak to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his native town of Aubervilliers, was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighborhoods above all.
My proposal n°1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, today claims to be "100% apolitical" even if he has not always been neutral.
A 2002 campaigner alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are linked to the left, but if the people on the right are willing to support me, I will listen to them too.
It's only the extremist parties I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program -consultable on the Internet- from many themes supposed to speak to suburban residents and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civilian majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the function of building guardian...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, it may be fair, he admits."
It's a matter of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune already has seven list leaders in metropolitan France and Martinique.
“And the support emails I’ve been receiving since yesterday don’t all come from the suburbs,” he said.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage “had gone too far inappropriately.”
John Kerry indicated a softening of the United States' defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedented fact, that on several occasions, the espionage "had gone too far inappropriately."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, ruled over “autopilot” when a series of incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities emerged.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Kerry said: “It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned some things in autopilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course 9/11.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused as part of this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to be blown up.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did indeed prevent planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said Thursday.
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the sense of frustration aroused by the National Security Agency’s surveillance.
“It’s really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stay by our side in mutual engagement in the fight against terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term and chair of the U.S. Senate’s European Affairs Subcommittee, said in an interview from Washington.
And I’m going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA’s programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some U.S. allies, however the director of the agency said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding as it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations came from documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
The director of intelligence, James Clapper, justified the espionage of the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy said his office was arranging a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and he hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and from both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be revealed in the coming days.
He said the route remains to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “affectionate firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of spy programs they have been running for years.
“We can modify our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world who are spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Kerry plans to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with the resentment generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plummeted by Shell's poor performance and the aftermath of an announcement by the Fed of keeping its support for the economy as expected.
Australian woman appeals prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province court on June 15 after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to having invented the story.
She was detained in a local police station cell prior to the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women’s prison.
This is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who called on Canberra’s foreign ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“Obviously we’ve been through a stressful time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a bond of 50,000 baht was paid.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on holiday in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in sentences of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore its deteriorated image to tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht supporters who have come in other than with RSCA buses
French police have decided to put in place strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman for the Brussels-midi police zone, on Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who want to go to this Champions League meeting will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has indicated that measures have been taken to make arrests or even police custody possible," Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated a year ago a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
For the past year, Vision Diversité has been working in schools to help students of all backgrounds discover common references that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, of artists, whether they are of a strain or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we’re creating projects so they identify with all of this,” says Aida Kamar, President of Diversity Vision.
Michel Venne, of the New World Institute, identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the feeling of belonging, the support to the staff in the transformations that we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he enumerates.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has created a research centre that will provide tools for teachers who sometimes also come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
“Different pedagogical strategies are the real need,” she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
