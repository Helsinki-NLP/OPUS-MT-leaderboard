The remnants of UKIP who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You’re talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS shouldn’t be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted ones.
First you use specific arguments, then you discredit them with a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue up behind chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one who makes special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing freaks, hardly exists.
I think that’s what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there’s no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a towel does not constitute proof.
Yes, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You also know nothing about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when trying to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence was very surprising, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You will need to be able to recover.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don’t like it when the media talks about what you don’t like.
We rarely talk about it because unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcher disciples who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
In the end, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the period of austerity will not have arranged anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's 'Tiger of Europe' was boasted to us a few years ago.
We've known the sequel!
This begins to read the article again.
We are trying to make people believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ‘NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE’ is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients there is nothing to pave for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the eighties of the twentieth century, irlance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development was not a long quiet river, is on the face of recent events.
Lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the taxes actually paid by the multinationals.
According to a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay full price.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars in every corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily plugs since the beginning.
Is it supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon ignite.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astras are involved in a hit on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said I’m flying with him next week, so I hope it won’t be on one of those two once rigged.
That would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers an extra fee for the additional fear they were given?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can be happy.
Any article about Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair over those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic fare just have to go after themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays are going to be and whether it will be necessary to compensate the passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake of the airport air traffic controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome on board this British Airways flight that takes the British ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is mostly pedestrian, and literally crowded.
People do not come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (some, for the most part) nor for the Salon de la revue at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners spending...
Do you think the opening on Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, crowded with 50% tourists.
False Aloes!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy tax-free.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of revenue each year for the same reasons.
There remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices .
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed, with exceptions, by employees.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the minister in charge of the economy, nor, moreover, the minister in charge of foreign affairs, has the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
While they're shutting it down.
What is the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies that want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my town of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but we do not!
This is access to culture...
This is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life that he defended tenaciously against fascism
the way of life that he defended tenaciously against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against his will, used to pay the estate fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not terrible.
No doubt his estate would want his share of the cake, if you give me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to independence from places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
I don't either.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss a “deal” with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and ultimately the whole world, can thank God for having had during those five years, just those five years, Churchill at the helm and no other.
Churchill’s greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to collect money from the estate fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage to his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure projects are by definition poorly renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they well reflect the real evil of francai: the distrust towards dialogue
Return to Principles.
Reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his aid, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who earns income from his property.
It is necessary to differentiate between those who invest for a return at the time of their retirement and those who live from their annuities.
A property to rent or two for a couple above, it's vice
The little genius of finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of great infrastructure shortages.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of degrowth emerges in response to a recession that is only a savage, therefore brutal, degrowth.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less severe, then the need for investment is screaming: insulation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, energy transport and storage, etc.
Taxation that favours high incomes and renters.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is a gallop.
Samsung's profits are being undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
AppleTM’s mid-September introduction of larger displays for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have appealed to buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I believe it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people don’t value design, for them options, functionality and price take precedence.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a better platform.
Is there “a better car manufacturer”, not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
That is in our interest to all of us.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it’s not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course, Parisian fools) could tell us which author they fight ideas about gender and indicate to us the works that they intend to fight rightly.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Now, John, I love you, and you're a smart, educated man.
I said this about Judith in Furusato's vein evoking Holopherne, a rapprochement that hadn't come to me (I don't have her quickness of mind).
Otherwise, in the "depth", since you refer to it, I am not interested in this subject, and sincerely I do not see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my arrears, because I am slow but I understand well...
John: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holofernes does.
Who is afraid of the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid of?
Furasato and . . . give us elements of response.
The first invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
You can see how intimate these studies are at home.
We are no longer, of course, in the debate of ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
Have you read, John, that the world has published an article on the necessity of theology?
Q: In this debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the very point of view of their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But well, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure if the nuance is understood.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I contented myself with the "Second Sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat compensated for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud really enclosed the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey makes Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it back its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with it, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week with Perseid meteor showers and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm starting to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne really isn’t the best place for an observatory, even though things get a lot better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a tax on this eclipse.
Anyone looking at this eclipse should pay a tax.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like your last thought before you go to bed.
Who or what will you be obsessed with when it ends?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Great picture of the moon above Sydney's Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth.
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
There is nothing about the inequalities between income from labour and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon.
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hyperlink to the original documents so you can get an opinion.
Go see today Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports are at the lowest in five years.
In Greece, the stock market is collapsing.
Yet these seem to be the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation in the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of Economy tells us that these claims are unfounded.
What happens if the Ministry of Economy makes a mistake?
Will policymakers who have garnered the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack on notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
The state is not comparable to households in terms of budget management because the state's time horizon is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifespan of its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to the financing of material and intangible investments that guarantee future growth and therefore future revenues.
Some elements of the answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember Hippocrates’ sacred oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all else.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth doesn’t match your fantasy.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands bound by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgeries, safe shoot rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues the politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
Doctors don’t make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Because the Liberals want our health care system to look like the United States, you should learn about how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been misspoken to put the blame on tubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, put corporate profits and “research” first.
So read the few reports on our spending on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the worldwide prices of medicines present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is over-the-counter or prescription only.
It is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations for oncological pain, despite the laws that hold them back and the costly permits needed.
While manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy to use alternatives such as marijuana, those who come up with a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a person in charge of this hospital.
You can't have patents on grass.
If social science “researchers” were doing research instead of politics and networking, one might be using their “work.”
A researcher does not compare one fact to another.
To compare is not to look.
To compare is to do pedagogy, not research.
You can’t say “the research is done, you have to apply it” and then in the same jet “you have to experiment everything goes”.
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is unsuccessful, why do you ask for it to be applied?
Can one explain to me how a “researcher” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies allow students to learn on the condition that they learn to use new technologies, but how would they be able to learn new technologies if they did not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are just an indicator let's make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What good is it to build an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a willingness to self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologues away from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
re-read the paragraph on internships (which is unfortunately not very well argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of current practices, and that does not allow to advance the system".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be desired that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in a modern teacher training.
Educational theorists should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of problems in the education system.
To give more weight to educational theorists would be to destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally messy: if I don't want to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, much less would I want to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP for the Fight Against Copyright Violation by David Cameron
Why doesn’t he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright, I’ll just have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = vol.
This is the same as they have to cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license doesn’t cost anything.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not the same thing.
By using content without the proper license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can always debate pedant assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, but it won’t become true.
It is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Apparently you don’t mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in schoolwork, an almost perfect definition of what reasonable use should be, then I’m happy to deprive them of that fictitious income.
Lesson No. 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they passed by a click.
Maybe if they share the headphones of their mp3 player with a boyfriend on the school bus, they should be kicked out for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource that we are full of, the screamer who says that everything is wrong....
If a member of the PS says so, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are of choice, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continually assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down are speeches like yours.
I've been working in a private company for a long time.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the null bosses I encounter frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
Igus, if we compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to call for reforms in France, in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small ones - What are the French bosses waiting to do the same??
Should the state hold their hand?
That state they accuse of imperity?
Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet on your part!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so harsh?
Pat, I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who mumble and minaude while waiting for the permanent assistance of the state!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I'm from, Last hasn't really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than transform.
That doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of them.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that.
I've tried to have them recently, but I haven't succeeded.
But, well, Labour's going to get us bored, isn't it...
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from setting up a more moral business and participating in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all to finally cancel the decision.
MTR, a Hong Kong company, has won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
I guess they will be happy with that decision. ;)
This may be because the management of the Dutch is on good track while the management of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
“She was a fighting girl.”
Lord, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beating" is a superior quality to many others, caring for others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beatings", who are no less dead, I know some slugs.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's start again, too.
I'm not telling you that's THE condition to manage, I'm telling you that it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When it comes to the examples of your life, it’s only you to judge them.
I'll start over.
To insinuate, even for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can derive merit from not getting out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A loose body, everywhere, in spite of the will, in spite of the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
Sorry to think otherwise, but having a strong morale probably makes it easier to accept and prepare for heavy treatments, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is fighting in medicine is above all someone who trusts in medicine.
But if you prefer to surrender to the "lord" it's something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a piece of dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally I caught two of them, dirt, fat, and if I "fought" as these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is all about grinding your teeth, suffering hell, and taking the hits.
I thought the indictment against Milosevic was decided and finalized about a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told at the time?
The communist-turned-nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left out: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under THE MINDRE rule of international law?
What country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, it would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smokescreen to detach part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was readily recognized by the Western states that then lied from end to end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian shouldn’t call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
To my knowledge there is only in Greece a method of predicting earthquakes works roughly, by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This type of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus, which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to feature detectable water molecules," according to a study by Drake Deming's team and Framing's Jonathan Framing.
method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat coming.
Thank you Science Passer for delighting us, often, of these experimental feats that are realized in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Possibly by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas that is odorless to humans but may be detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments at his disposal.
However, we do not have reliable results on these tracks.
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report about the struggle of two scientific teams, one Californian and the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work that dealt with the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more specifically to their modification before an earthquake.
I’m not a scientist, but I was convinced by their assumptions.
Or are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again.
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by the animals, we come across the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely in circles.
I don't understand that you can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help but think that this man doesn't know anything about it and that he's always trying to have fun with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He could not name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor, and he didn't keep one.
It just underscores how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was on “Have I Got News For You.”
Because it's a celebrity and people have been instilled with celebrity adoration.
The Londoners voted for him, and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will break the ceiling I am sure.
May God help us.
I’m not so sure: people like jokes, but they don’t want their prime minister to be one of them.
That's exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought his friend the parpaing, smarter than he was.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have really and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have bothered to read a few books (there are, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the “Solomon” and the “strait of scrap” speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be on the bottom since the Battle of Savo) do not want to go back there.
We actually passed the island of Savo, in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecology side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerozene consumes to achieve the goal totally discredits the concept.
Just browse through the list of sponsors that philanthropists.
A com operation is neither done nor done.
The cow is too much!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your recital makes me look back, identifying myself a bit in passing (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Rade de Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep coming back, and show with pride that Britons are great travellers!
Peter, from Trinidad and Tobago.
I think the red hat that protested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public agencies of all kinds should not spend a penny of our taxes to finance the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian line-up who are of Kosovan origin?
I know Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don’t know if they’re still in the team.
This is Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or before in the 70s and 80s and has trained many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he comes from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great team of Velez who, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished in second place twice in the Yugoslav league (and also had sizes like Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsène Wenger's loyal teammate, Boro Primorac).
Well, thanks Mole!
I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was related to Blackburn.
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not in charge.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania of today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little bit of nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the major European powers decided to give parts of the country to neighboring countries.
How can one have felt "an explosion of joy" when two towers collapsed knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children are inside?
How???
What bothers me a little in this "testimony" is that the mere fact of having been able, even once, to spontaneously rejoice in the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to me of a "border line" personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with the utmost circumspection.
No doubt in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought about the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
One will only have thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to really and apocalyptically do evil to the great evil Satan in his very heart.
Do qqch powerfully.
That's great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims gnawed at by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classical Schadenfreude.
We had a little bit of a doubt.
The "Christian/White/Gaulian" West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Arab Muslim world.
I am talking about the outskirts of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Fully in phase, 2 major poisons are irrigating the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
That it has been understood before, must not push back the Muslims.
That's the only way.
Has Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess that’s true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long, dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Plus, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and people like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a bit for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of about to die.
In Britain, if you are lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, don't make your grumpy fool laughing clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to outside germs, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a feverishness that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snowfall and lots of other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, those dark, gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child surcharges, it is the amount received by the State that comes mainly from the deciles 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households that have seen their taxes increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly the deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Figure 2 .
The elimination of the half part concerning mainly widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M of euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to be fixed.
Well, we're not on straw, but we're singers.
For once the PS does a politics rather left we will not cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% have to bear far more than 75% of the tax hikes, why not 90%?
Let’s continue this way and you will encourage these 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I say it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the OIC recycled to the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from raising as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money has been exceeded, money is now only used to make money, that is to say, to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are among the richest 20%.
Probably also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth of which part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or else just as much to lower your arms and live social minima, especially if you have a social housing .
The utopias of the Khmer Rouge head-cutters have fortunately lived.
I've been doing two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or deal with the slightest hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone’s house, sleep in it, put it behind you and leave.
This will be my first choice when I travel.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowner’s insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Oh, six o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and very risky” No, that’s not true.
You're just really out of luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb’s response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why is this article quoting Teman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive and to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I’m planning to pay a down payment and a month’s rent all at once but I’m a bit afraid to send $1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Support the troops,” the Bu$herie chanted in all tones.
Weapons are harmless.
I’m sure it will please the families and loved ones of thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends succumbed to something other than Saddam Hussein’s chemical bombing.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to stay polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We all agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are always at war.
Alternative: It’s ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we’re still at war?
Education would already be greatly enhanced if they were “worked” 35 hours instead of 17.
Currently, our teachers earn more than engineers.
And don't be made to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their schedules.
But this is not visible since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office in high school to its teachers so they work at home.
Some kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer pays neither the computer, nor the internet connection, nor the supplies.
Besides, it is so much the board at 5 pm a week and 4 months of vacation that we can not fill the CAPES with maths, come, we are waiting for you.
What do you mean you don't feel like collating with poorly educated whites whose parents spit on you by calling you a slut?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Khurde population can flourish better.
The Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in selling, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a position for which I needed a degree.
A year later, I saw an advertisement to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid 5,000 more per year and we didn’t even apply for the patent.
I never regretted it.
Don’t worry about it if you don’t find a graduate job, try to find something either that pays well, or that you like to do.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I would still be paying my student loan
I don't like working in business so much, so I hope to eventually move either into the public service or into academia.
LOL LOL LOL This post is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year arrears.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of bleak courses like art/letters/theatre/media/philosophy/political sciences, i.e. what are called unemployed diplomas.
I have one of those degrees and I'm finished as a production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting salary was lower, but we quickly climb the ladder because in the real world what counts is results rather than knowledge.
This engineering/artistic studies debate has been going on for years.
Scientists cannot solve all problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in order to get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are two-way channels?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about degrees like media study or whatever absconded track you've been in.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real channels.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn’t it be better to have a real territorial policy to de-energize Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I can hardly see the inhabitants of the end of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise going back and forth every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-mural residents and the small belt already have many more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as they already exist in cities in northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
As much benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for ONE bike hooking device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë.
Well, it's not okay at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other users of public transport why they do not ride bicycles, it seems to me that the main reasons that emerge are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that ride super fast and do not care about the survival of bicycles 2/ we take a lot of pollution in the head For me the bike paths are the traffic zone.
Bicycle paths are apartheid, we must coexist but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in Paris?
No word on the place of the bicycle in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% of speeding is ridiculous.
I'm starting to believe Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, according to OR, the EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket begins, it would be better to find out who really is behind this massacre.
Note: This is not Russia.
Not sure how the world is changing.
Looks awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they should first file a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other planes had been shot down previously, Ukraine was launching into the area of air attacks against the rebels and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the face of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents for airlines to pay overflight fees?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who are defending their usurper government/the ultranationalists of western Ukraine – and who want to demonstrate in large measure that Putin shot down MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 International Court of Justice ruling that the CIA’s supply of weapons to Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not let this case go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to substantiate his allegations.
So far, investigators have not said anything like this.
Calling yourself Ricardo and being such an eco-beotien is heartbreaking!
Calling yourself Polar is losing the north is cheerful.
One question from Beotien: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can’t help but notice that those who criticize Piketty’s book the most have not read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequalities-concentration, inequality of income from labor, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today joins that of the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual’s ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Second, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is correct, it can be debated without having read the book, the main part of which is to argue one way in favor of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of its pavement summarized by the press false?
I have not read it and will not read it.
So I rely on the summary of his central thesis and this is what seems to me to be pure smoke.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn’t humanity become globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to a population increase is the real political question today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn’t where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “colored perverts”?
You should not have any "antenna time" on this site.
You are, yourself, a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely disgusting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when he was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and always has been, for her to receive a higher education and for her to have the right to decide her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, since he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may sound contradictory, but maybe she means that if her father hadn’t given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years old.
Rather disappointed by this entry in terms of season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a bit of a hard time finding her lookalike character from Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange’s show singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven’t watched this season yet (which will be my last, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I would rather have all of a sudden than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is for sure, apart from Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mostly the risks of staging and editing that amazed me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the asepticization of today's productions.
I miss it a little bit to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
No, it’s just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series outside of the technical qualities.
Oh, well, I look at her a lot.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, she wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in Season 2 it was too scattered despite a few excellent episodes.
I don’t see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it’s going to end up like 24 hours time what.
Everyone does what they want!
It is by what I say “I will not look back” that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think will be fatal to her.
But after that, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - coupons instead in state spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to spend money failed.
Discuss relatively small expenditure items, such as development assistance
The problem is that it represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to be calling for, and all this time some on each side are pretending that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are – and voters are clear in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenses.
“Debt” refers to assets held primarily by financial institutions in this country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I wouldn't have a problem with the government seizing a third of my income (before even talking about consumption taxes) if I thought it was going to be used wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage was not quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to wind turbines almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you arrive at a figure that makes the taxes of the workers and the Libs look much more ridiculous.
Your first $10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns 35,000 pounds a year will pay about 5,000 pounds (one-seventh of their salary), someone with 50,000 pounds would pay around 10,000 pounds (one-fifth), etc., and someone with 200,000 pounds pays about 70,000 pounds (just over a third).
What about social contributions?
The higher the social contributions, the higher the local taxes, the higher the parking fees and the car sticker, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car sticker.
I get paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it’s a problem, of course, I’m happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed person looking for work from door to door prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed would not search, it means that 80% seek and do not find.
Being unemployed myself, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances that much.
In fact, I haven't heard from Pôle Emploi in months, does that mean that agents are more busy with control operations than really getting job ads in?
I don't see the point.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then you have to do without Pole Emploi.
Why is this a sensitive topic?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed perform their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their transport title to the users of a means of transport, a head of service or are the employees of their work, etc.
No one screams scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to recall that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I dealt with Pôle Emploi, my rights in the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the cases, amputated by 40%, we had to fight hard.
It takes time!
I am not an expert in law.
Registration and control is currently taking over, while statutory Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should only concern the employees, they are the ones who pay the contributions.
French politicians and non-wage earners give themselves rights they don’t actually have!
That's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance contributes to the valorization of wage-earnings.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In reality, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the presence of spirit to ban Hadj in Mecca this year to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application denied because of their country of origin or their recent travels.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense, but apparently the “knowers” decided that you could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed under strict quarantine.
Nobody's going out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Last week alone, people were contaminated after having contact with people in West Africa despite taking “all necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
We forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, airport customs officers should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be immediately quarantined.
That he manages to convey the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is capable of erecting as dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortexes of the planet in operation.
He is still far from that conception.
It's only been 20 years since information emerged as humanity's given premium, while religion, from the cerebellum, directs our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming yet another Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not set foot in the Church anyway, it is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiety"?
Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will touch more people...
“Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envision it existed pre-existed in the Christ.
Hillel had already said a century before him, “Don’t do to others what you don’t want them to do to you, that’s all the Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!”
Christianity goes far beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "move justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
The next step is to remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain that hero who has upset moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It doesn't come up.
Personally, I would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don’t think it’s worth 30 pounds.
If it’s the PC version you’re interested in, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for 30 pounds and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for ?30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll look.
Obviously not at work.
The flip-flops of the computer department block all the cool sites.
Hello, is it 30€ and then 20% off, or does the 30€ include the 20% off?
Note, however, that the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's void.
It’s time to buy a new video card.
It’s a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat Emptor and all that: I didn’t use it myself.

So, was 1940’s France a “rotten land”?
So, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Must we love the France of 40, that of the "strange defeat"?
When one sees who gets the Nobel Prize in literature one wonders if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, you don’t even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes such a limited and egocentric universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at his fair value, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue dating Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso still stand their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Greetings to the terrible ones.
Since I drove one in Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallowing me like the horrible Superman III computer?
Hello Dantra, always hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham beer and cider party.
It was borderline.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people out there, there weren’t just CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really tough.
Monday night we went to a buddy's grandfather to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real starter chance I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope that if I get to 95 I will be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
Having said that, I don’t want to upset you, I think you’re moving a little further away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits quests for jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
She reports arms trafficking without delay.
Either you have wide eyes like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or you have wide eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you gain access to light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you are making a monumental counter-sense: all the representative authorities, organizations or associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Whoever says a word consents.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they publicly demonstrate to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt them.
This principle is in my opinion the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the destruction of French society.
If there is no doubt, so to speak.
Who does not say a word of consent, but consents to what?
Consent to proximity to ISIS or condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, “revenge” the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron has to laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't give a damn about Scotland because they don't have any seats.
They can do whatever they want with electoral impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a long-term good thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the “PROMISE” thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are holding their leaders accountable.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's what's important.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives ever want to be re-elected in England.
Waxing 8% at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs will no longer be able to vote on subjects that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and she did it well.
Yet he is still in the running to be prime minister in 2015 and this since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
This is East Germany's "Life of Others" or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination with surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will at least have a sterilizing effect.
I am waiting for the next ticket: Amazon makes YOUR book according to YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!

Highly stimulating.
Thanks for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I have to read the pirated files, books in the public domain or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without biting.
Given the price I paid the Kobo, it's no regrets.

But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic acid children.
This is even worse if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some supporters of Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot itself in the foot unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will fight back, so it’s actually shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: “The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran would send a serious warning of retaliation or whether it would simply advise caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and US diplomatic engagement concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.
The reading of Indian Punchline is to be strongly recommended to anyone paying attention to details rather than to the c*nneries balanced by the traditional media. The short article you are giving the link to is important and should be read keeping in mind the previous realistic observations / warnings coming from Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these “moderates” who seriously fight the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy pushes the world to the abyss and I would suggest those who refer to non-existent “moderates” pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one on my mind.
It would require a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it “needed”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of still being alive?
A little late for that, my friend.
Wouldn’t criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, huh?
Particularly concerning the CUP triumvirate that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal were killed just after World War I by vengeance by the Armenians, and Enver was killed by the Bolsheviks in a poised place in Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
Just clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart that beats even in the womb of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may simply be a child’s desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterile straight couples too.
As for the children!
Shame on you for designating them as psychologically imbalanced futures.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say they are happy to live, to make a living and to pay this lady’s retirement (?)
GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It is not from today.
Many women bore and gave birth to children who were not from their husbands.
It is still so, we are so made...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "merchandization" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics are not also commodification of the bodies?!
Anachronic Fareinheit ...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good one grow in a distant country via the internet and Pay Pal than to take on its responsibilities and or avoid scandal in another century near home without shouting it at that time on all roofs! ...
These practices were not done in the name of the church!
It is not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices.
Nevertheless, the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.

I don’t know why there are so many disparaging comments here about what Paul Mason is saying, maybe they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article about football that is waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of reporting that really reflects the reality of Northern England’s culture.
No wonder Paul Mason understood the social and political context well, he understands things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can listen to it if you’re in the London area in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought “always the same story”, but this is a small article well written and well thought out.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.

Business is becoming more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to negotiate peace.
Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (by the way, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative stood up in anger and shouted: “What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian (UN) representative smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not give up their guard.
That it displeases the anti-Israeli is obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
This has always been the case since politics has been globalized.
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it certainly continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What relationship of force allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a power struggle!
Do you doubt that?!!!
Plus, it doesn’t just revolve around Russell Brand, but Guardian reporters seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Much of what he says is just pseudo-chomskyist billeze written by no others.
That proves you don’t understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It’s just a series of personal attacks and innuendo (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it’s a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths that we prefer not to think about.
Hold on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he does give the impression of being a novice populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross their arms completely to govern and to ignore the whole political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles / videos he posted, he says that to vote once every 5 years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and to limit the democratic commitment completely to different (or Lib Dems say)
I'm not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active by presenting his demands can go hand in hand with the fact of voting, since politicians are wheelbarrows that will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it's raging to see all these condescending answers that say that this idiot who is not just telling young people that it's the fool who is to take it all away from Jesus.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be nice if people debated what he actually said rather than simply labeling him irresponsible and setting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The voting thing has been completely distorted.
The futility of slipping a ballot into a ballot box every 5 years makes me deeply angry that my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, e-voting, direct democracy and MPs reporting locally to their constituents.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand’s words are not his (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group together under the label “pseudo-Chomsky billeves.”
I’m pretty sure that in a debate he would be able to convince Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, have Suzanne do it like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the headaches added to the editing!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russel but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him into his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by mainstream media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This “sling” reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the RDV of History where professional historians have become a minority and where the exchanges of specialists have become impoverished to the benefit of condensed ready-to-think type Sciences Po for press files.
For my part I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They develop both very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on those scapegoats that are the keystone of their thinking.
I believe instead that for Foucault the state was indispensable as the culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
We solve the problem of the relationship to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and/or libertarian slope (of both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire for the eradication of the state, the first knowing how to go for the help of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state/not state at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself beautifully.
Her thinking is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stance against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
Not a support by the way.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its god then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chauya too quickly if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet puts a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty posed by the mechanism of membership in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether you agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-left humanities researchers who can’t stand going without allegiance to their mantras is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add to me seems to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows” I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You haven't had the pleasure of hearing from our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I can't remember when I last saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same about white people.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the mid-20th century, and I still hear some of them speak violently anti-White.
My father's not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, Russians are mostly prejudiced against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very lucky to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Jenissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I’ve heard Australians’ opinions about the Chinese and Aboriginals.
It’s really weird that a foreigner tells me that I can’t stand the Chinese, when I’ve met two of them in my life (including one abroad), I haven’t kept any bad memories of them, all the people are worth each other and, in fact, the ones in London were very kind that’s the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don’t remember who we meet, all people are equal, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the so-called white.
How many Chinese men are with whites, by comparison?
None, because there is a good chance that the parents of these Whites would physically assault them.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by strongly marked groups on the left such as the judiciary union...
Marabout: Excuse me, but the judicial circles are frankly branded right.
When it comes to the Union of the Magistracy, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it commands to remove two obstacles.
That of the observer's political vision as that of the magistrate's factual interpretation.
It then remains the obligatory tool of the law to refocus evaluation on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including the prosecution, forces a distinction between the error and the partiality of the magistrates.
It would be futile to pretend that the acts of justice are not distributed among these three groups.
Pretentiousness and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only through statistics implicitly revealing that it starts from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to enter the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The domain under consideration is that of the spoliation* of heirs committed up to and including procedure scams* by estate genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession gets good year bad year 150 million euros while benefiting from the coverage* ensured by the almost judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, some of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the so-called statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to be robbed, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria an elaborate form of lies?
Probably completely prohibitive prices.
More equipment to scam the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never before a normal wheelchair, with cumbersome wheels and tires, could not.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks epic.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog's crust on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for longboarding.
There are hills here that they would like.
Prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so “you see.”
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know we need.
You can’t really say that Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not planned to be made.
I'm glad the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't hit the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombing of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as well, since this blockade inflicts a “collective penalty” on all civilians in Gaza.
“Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market.”
Oh, that's not the tongue of wood, rather in concrete and armed the lady...
References are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There’s the black market, that’s for sure, and it’s recognized.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-guarded territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Remember also that after lifting it, Morsi had re-established the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built on the back of the population that has chosen its masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've given it some thought.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the non-profit sharing economy.
Many are only looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it’s getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in a different way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, homeowners and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, thereby bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this.
“What do you rent on?”
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The verb “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do a business there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it really is a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would still be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates.
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...
Where are you going to moor it?
No, Marine Le Pen is not right.
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
Increasing wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends whom?
Who is defending what?
In 2017, the Mass will be celebrated!
Capitalism is not going to be impoverished.
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, so our food, so with the structures of care so our health, so with our debts so our institutions.
They are a threat to our daily lives by the same money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance".
It was 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild bank minister to better defend the interests of the banksters, who were solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else competent?
What do you call it, turning his jacket, lowering his trousers?
Primary and populist reaction
I don’t really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was stormy at the beginning of the day; I don’t know if it was still so at the end of the battle.
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this to the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, you see a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick Wikipedia search:
A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two battleships, which had disappeared in the dark after they had ceased firing, and a chase began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as it got closer it saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, leaning and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his spotlight on the ship's flag, the offer to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that Good Hope had escaped and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.
So, if this is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before the invention of radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not look for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in confusion they rushed out to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already harmed them and cost them about half their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several voices are raised in the UMP to request that it be inscribed in the law that a definitively convicted elected person be thus definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect left-wing elected officials of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSE A REGISTRATION AT THE CONSULTS OF MAGISTRATES
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to pamper the very ones who will take advantage of their immovability to hinder the actions of real politicians, who really try to make things move, not the beautiful talkers whose immobilism is up to their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little billboards "justice money" they came from the province and didn't tell the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
She supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold in the service of her party.
She would not defend the same theses if right-wing, even far-right unions targeted personalities on her side and led a juridical-media war against them.
Your affirmations are totally free.
If the right currently deals with judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that relate to it!
There has been no example of a left-wing personality that has had so much to do with justice, but not everyone who has been the subject of its attention has been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it must be remembered that the left-wing judiciary union is not the only union of magistrates and that it is a minority.
That a minister is so committed to supporting trade unions shows how useful they can be.
The union you are quoting may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellery, it is no secret.
The question now is whether the "mission" of certain judges is not more dirty than instructive.
You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
You forget that the magistrates are not officials like any other: they are the only ones who have the power to indict and incarcerate the one-on-one.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most fame-hungry fool realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I’d be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fills stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is in fact one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in contests in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens to most of the stars who don’t participate in the contests anyway.
There are few who, after a tube, manage to make others.
Anyway, most singers/bands can at best hope for three albums and one best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His fame comes partly from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it’s more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock journey, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar freaks who smoke grass in their father’s garage and swing three chords on a primary school level poem will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even releasing an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because ethnologists present these distant people to us as infinitely superstitious and kneaded with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by daily practices.
Except that you interpret imprudently in the opposite direction.
That is, rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacredness, is it not better to admit that our Mariannes and Molières are also a little sacred?
Our bias is as a reminder to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object confined to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
This is deco ephemere to furnish the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacredness still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw into the nettles not scientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative criticism of the disciplines to make us laugh a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasures are constantly discovered, valuable testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have such effective technical and scientific means that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can still be challenged by other discoveries!
One is there in full (and old) controversy about the shamanism advanced by the prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The shamans of prehistory", especially the augmented re-edition of scientific controversy, published in La Maison des Roches editions).
Thanks for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could do it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't go on to three?
This journal is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn’t watch a musical about it though, it would be too gay!
I could have expected that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse is back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than making fun of these puerile ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go on, then.
If these “childish ass jokes” shock you so much, you don’t have to participate, do you?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
However, you can find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
An amateur video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no way those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers, it would have taken out safety because at the time when another vehicle (e.g. a service car) entered the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (right TV, pub, money ...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots.
Of course, I agree with that as well.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the restart to beat the English that led then...
You're going to this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to find all your c******ries.
No, just no.
There have been lots of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in mortal danger for a distant story of one driver’s chance of victory at the expense of another.
It’s not the FOM that releases safety because it’s the FIA.
Nuance of size.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of image above all allows the FIA to avoid the awkward questions of the type: How is it that the commissioner shakes a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the stewards clearly agitated a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a gloomy displeasure of F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the agitated green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The station of clerks just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
The sensationalism sells the pub.
I used to think the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that ultimately it's just for the money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news is doing exactly the same thing.
Buzzing with information you don’t really need to worry about is just to keep scaring people in order to keep controlling them.
“When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear” It should be “destroying,” not “coughing.”
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “derailing.”
I wonder if all the people who worry that Ebola might start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and firmly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
I'm depressed that the media is talking about most things with that optimism upside down.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without getting to hysteria) so that the government can get us out of the way when it needs it.
I think it makes perfect sense that if we have to suffer a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn’t there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be of this world almost 35 years later.
At first it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s and 1990s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going through it for years.....
A perfectly useless testimony.
As always when it comes to science.
Not only are testimonials useless: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as a scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
Traffic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
This may be why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's an unimportant subjective testimony.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this attestation, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
On what basis are you doing the research, then?
On fantasies?
Do you put fanciful theories and facts on the same level (= giving rise to verifiable testimonials)?
"Resilience": the phony word flattered by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who consider themselves great psychologists after reading D'Ansembourg.
Jim: There are a lot of empty buzzwords in psychics.
Cyrulnik hit us with “resilience.”
Since he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have crafted a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn’t that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to get out of the Air Sentinels...
And why?
It was a great series and it looks like those who get it out are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can perform miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids hooked?
The only solution that comes to mind is pip-caca humor, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's series.
The children were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's series?
UKIP works for the Mysterions.
Keep your team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if we don't see the children and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although as an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a channel to rebroadcast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; we have had one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-rate commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And the half-hour episodes now go on at 5:30 a.m., Monday through Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the Mosque of the Esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the esplanades for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, exists elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it was Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
Since it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and submerged it continuously!).
It is also good to show how peaceful the annexation of Jerusalem is.
Will God be able to recognize His people?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: “God be praised!”
To brag about tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naïades half naked, lying on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what the advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
It is a pity that the Reuters photographer has not photographed the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to quash the Jewish faithful below, praying at the Lamentation Wall.
Matt, if this photo is bothering you, it is rightly not the newspaper or the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be spinning out, big companies have taken huge advantage of their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever higher wages to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of yelling and groaning when someone else goes on strike, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not being fucked with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case, it is sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are worst.
For example, China and India.
All of this can't end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it's held.
Did you vote for the CPI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of corporations held by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that’s exactly what the Investor-State Dispute Resolution (ISDS) mechanism proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It is only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement Look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
Didn’t Churchill say “blood, sweat and tears”?
These are great benefits, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the eighteenth there were unions in all regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (finally, its officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe in the safe of France’s eternal values, and it will fight and shut its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic is comforting.
Even though for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write French correctly, I'm a trade unionist.
You are warned, it will be your fault.
For the defense of the interests of the individual, the protected professions with trade unions are already suffering enough, which has created a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of an official.
One can very well imagine a system ensuring a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or otherwise without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster is assured.
And with the carts getting ready, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for Ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other civil servants, since that is the subject here commented...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of enterprises.
This is absolutely essential with the emergence of information power.
And yet you’ve opened, probably read, and then commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off Review.”
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I watched, and I can tell you that some of them have been well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (though misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the mmmh pie...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely enough, the show ends with a victory for the least bad baker; no one has ever said, “Boom, here’s my fucking cake now eat it and bow to your master!”
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And there’s also this idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears in the last week.
I love to cook, but I can't imagine doing that.
I am grateful to those who do and offer us great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Go ahead for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
All three challenges were really hard to start, I don’t know how they were able to pick a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the slightly dry base (although I agree with Hollywood that the green glaze on Richard’s mill didn’t feel like it, Richard had already lost at the time anyway).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time.
There is also cancer waiting, with solar wind blows.
Definitely, everything succeeds us right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn’t be enough solar wind to “blow” the ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore fewer, UV and “cancers.”
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, apparently, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and allows UVA and most UVBs to pass through.
You know that you don’t have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor a linger when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the commentary, which he himself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Not to mention that I am used to melanoma, UV only accelerates its development.
They're not provoking it.
As proof: not all tanned people necessarily have melanomas.
Either, when a toubib tells you to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And more importantly, can we pass it on to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested have established that everything can be folded if enough force is applied and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communication hardware.
But for us,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
This joke is made in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke about folding that I read in the comments today.
It’s hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and we can hardly see how it could return to it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........................................
Most likely, this is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed properly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don’t know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on all of them?
The photographs on eBay clearly show the absence of an FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
Ah, the article for bobo par excellence.
We want inexpensive products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in "industrial" We highlight super u but all the brands and even the small business are concerned How to eat good, bio avac 1650€ (average salary in france)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to put their priorities where they want.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without a grudge, I'll kiss you
We call bobos, or rather boboécolos, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that causes them to disconnect from the realities.
It is total thought-reason unbundling.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuffery, joining the left-cavian, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartufery so do not be surprised to often encounter criticism about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the related details (airplane, shower...).
I would love to be a part of it, but I don’t find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboécolos are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of left-cavian?
Well you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
This is the perfect copy with just an ideological hue.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecology at all.
The boboécolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the ecologies because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look this giraffe in the face.
She is so badly made that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Shut up, you're next to the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of truth in this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by not having any artistic ability.
That's "art."
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
This is not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy is realistic reproductions of dogs smoking while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you’re looking for just that, a camera will do the trick.
The author also talks about Emin’s expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still room for savings: riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service.
Honesty requires that France reduces its numbers, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half-hearted...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
That's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where gagegy is certain.
Let all those who have coexisted little or enough of the military thing dare to come and say here, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
Applying the same potion to the public service as a whole will make the public finances a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why La Défense can feel a bit burdened!
Well, yes, the savings that everyone agrees they need to be made, you have to see it somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls moan at murder when it happens at home, the poor darlings.
It should be done, but above all it should not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for the local authorities, history is repeated with each closure of the post office, maternity, hospital and barracks.
But everyone is for savings, of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and is not happy with the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I’ve ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It’s the depression of scrolling through his Facebook feed and seeing that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they're gonna make a movie out of it.
He will surely rely on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus going to work and only realizes that his skirt is back in his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and clench his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence has been something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now in the middle of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don’t have the internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
Having no computer.
God, I have to watch this movie before I die!
I can’t believe how amazing this article is!
Charlie really just showed that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm going downhill!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible brilliance and insurmountable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard like a divine gleam.
Oh, my God, it was really bad.
Especially if they are not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice we are being confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play truffles at every meeting to save the planet.
So we, citizens, decide to take matters into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted on energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Wind turbines and solar farms are the round points of tomorrow.
All financed by the taxable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the entire industry is not controlled, it is better to limit yourself to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, we drastically reduce our consumption.
Renewable electricity to fight CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other steps.
Electricity by renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse than coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittence.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PV would be against the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am a Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981 more I did research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove lez contrary to what I said.
For what I didn’t say it was you who lent me ideas I didn’t say anything about Germany nothing in fact you didn’t respond to what I was saying and like all right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
If you do not count the extraction of uranium and the construction and if you do not count the water vapour greenhouse gases of less effect than Co2, it is true that two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant starts in water vapour and a little in the water of rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a “South Asian giant”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
No wonder most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia.
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora’s box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today’s opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata’s Athletico winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India spends on IPL cricket and now on football, how could we ever compete with our “noisy neighbors”...
The low-cost launcher race is paid cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only manifests itself with a too cold helium.
So we may not be in a design flaw, but implementation...
Unlike arianespace which is a private company, it seems well that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer.
They may be paying the satellites in frigates who knows..
This is all the more unfortunate as many media outlets loop back only article titles – and many readers only retain those titles.
In total, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project when it is just a launcher problem.
