The blade of an even bedside skate has a double edge with a hollowed-in bush in place. The edge allows a smooth grip on the even bed when leaning.
As the lower part of the blade is slightly curved, when the blade tilts to one side or the other, the edge that contacts the bed also bends.
This causes the skater to turn. If the skates bend to the right the skater turns to the right, if the skates bend to the left the skater turns to the left.
To return to the energy level of the former, the need to free itself from the energy in order to escape from the light.
And it does so by emitting the "photon" chunk on a pitch.
The scientists call this process "emission stimulated radiation" because atoms are stimulated to give strong light, which causes the emission of a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation.
