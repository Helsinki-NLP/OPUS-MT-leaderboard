Members of the Assembly of Wales worried about 'identifying them as Muppets'
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposed modification of their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen root of the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a cause for ridicule.
A member of the Labour assembly said his party was concerned that MWP "remained with Twp or Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, feces.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly has commented that his party as a whole "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh Conservative member has claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but also commented that there is a too small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English letter "u".
According to the committee of the assembly in charge of drafting the legal draft to introduce the changes of names: "The final decision on any qualifier for appointing the members of the assembly will of course fall on the members themselves".
The 2017 Law of the Government of Wales gives the Assembly of Wales all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to that of the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee chose "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" is the one that received the most broad support in the public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach a consensus may be a disgrace to the Speaker of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee’s system.
Members of the Assembly shall hold the final vote on their denomination during the debate related to the legislation.
Macedonians will vote in referendum to change their country's name
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way of reclaiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, against the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favor, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's cease to ring: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the elderly people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“Nowadays, there aren’t any of them.”
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
“People have a different way of socializing today,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the kind of living rooms for the neighborhood where people would periodically go.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders foresee "and that sooner or later they will return to the place where they came from".
Churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who won’t be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and so what they will do will be to speed up the closure of all churches, as it is entirely unlikely that the majority of people who move to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that was originally there left during the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired ownership of the building.
St. Martin's passed to a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street retailers, one of the main shopping streets of Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the lane.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, described the lane as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who sounded the lane in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first lane in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest lane of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded in St. Martin's in recent months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing concern that the diocese would "pretend to pass on the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy while searching for locusts in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for locusts in California on the first day of the locust season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on KSWB-TV in San Diego, he spent half an hour diving with some friends on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of a boy asking for help. Then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he "realized he was shouting 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!'
He had the whole collarbone ripped off," Hammel observed as he reached the boy.
"For everyone to come out of the water, I cried out, 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in serious condition.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, first responder Larry Giles said that I had been working for weeks to find a shark in the area, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to the investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete at Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product corridors in the style of busy department stores with specialized employees.
These large corridors are only part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty products market, a market that moves around GBP 28 billion and continues to grow as the fashion and household products sectors fall behind, and 11 stores across the country will be tested to expand to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty products is the product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of similar brands that can be found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also relaunching its range of makeup products Boutique so that most products are now vegan-friendly, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions to two Sainsbury's stores. The first did so last week in Croydon, south London, while the second will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching to buying food in smaller quantities every day at small supermarkets has made big supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury’s, the stores will increasingly resemble department stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets to many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to revive grocery sales and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy product departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's made a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended hastily by not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the pharmacy chain within supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP three years ago.
According to Sainsbury’s, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand its range of luxury leather brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the look of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help in offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to fit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and convenient location make us now one of the favorite destinations for beauty products and we challenge the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby backs down from 11-million-pound deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby backtracked an 11-million-pound deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to devote to the joint business of Truly household products and accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' Den star Peter Jones infuriated by retiring in the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle brand set business to focus on his new own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him big profits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the blonde television star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at her empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the host's new deals, worth AU$1.5 million, implied she would no longer have enough time to devote to the Tru's joint household products brand and accessories.
The business had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was meant to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to back down left all involved speechless.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow headquarters ready to be sold."
According to experts, the departure of the host of This Morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions because of the significant investment that had been made in products, from cushions and candles to clothes and household clothes, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president last March.
Both couples spend the holidays together. In addition, Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said: "We will not comment on his business."
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "little of a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mocking the tone of a news anchor:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first one held in Singapore in June was declared as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations towards denuclearization are stagnant.
More than three months after the summit held in Singapore in June, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “corresponding response” from the US to its country’s first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s view, however, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We’re doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: an end to missile tests, help to free hostages and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded compound, we’d have about 200,” Trump said, noting the crowd in front of him.
A destroyed island and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations from other countries were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for being able to catalyze international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding,” says Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it’s not certain even if foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies are allowed to contribute when offering aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country is unfortunately still unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not frequent on other shores.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, even if there was a warning in place, is very likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Moving between the huge number of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is now heading for Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's malign infrastructure, and he has invested huge amounts of money on roads and railways.
However, Joko's government is facing reelection next year, loaded with funding deficits.
Joko is also facing pressure from the country's persistent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 dead and tens of thousands displaced are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloodthirsty weapons.
Observe: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge makes the goal of the draw with a far shot against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with his 89th minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was losing 1 to 0.
He placed the ball to the left before letting go of an incredible shot aimed at the second suit.
The shot crossed the entire area with a large elevation as it propeled toward the right cross of the goal.
The ball finally started the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position so I could shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as I could,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kanté coming, I did a touch and I didn’t think much about it, I just dedicated myself to juicing.”
Chelsea won 1-0 at rest after scoring a goal in the 25th minute through their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, Blue's frontman turned upside down to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost midfield and sprinting to Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the midfield.
He then made a magnificent in-depth pass, leaving Hazard inside the area with the ball under control.
Hazard overcame the defense to finish in the second pole with a left leg shot where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker was unable to reach.
Liverpool will face Naples in the group stage of the Champions League next Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, meanwhile, will play for Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho news agency at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding woman stabbed
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with several stabbings at Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked the residents of the area to see or feel something about the crime before the authorities.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "While the investigation is still at a preliminary stage, I would like to make a call to everyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the car’s on-board camera, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body they found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, police have said they are reporting the facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are being told that it will be hours before they can get back in.
It felt like a police officer was telling a man that the entire area is being treated as the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
He keeps saying, “It’s terrible!”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the contiguous area with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remain within the contiguous zone controlling the block of floors.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 and mentioning file 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of the British parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of Westminster Palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor during the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an accurate representation remains a matter of historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Pig Killer Injures Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, local sources say.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a carved artery and all covered in blood near a pig court at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as we know, he had traveled Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to an adjoining pork court.
He said there was a large male pig in the court with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kilometre throat had wounded the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were shattered and full of blood," said the cousin, surnamed "Wu," as mentioned in the Guiyang evening news.
Scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by either Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented in the evening news that the pig was locked and isolated in order to prevent anyone else from attacking, while police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Despite being very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 300 kg caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to frighten the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
“They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't go with the idea of doing harm.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rain throughout the southwestern U.S.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the cooler waters of Mexico's north coast.
However, the Rosa will carry torrential rain throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, typical of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, Eastern U.S. time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that the rose will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave strong tropical humidity northward toward the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous streams, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a chance that rivers will form, as the situation is getting worse very quickly due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to walk into the desert in the face of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms can carry wind streaks and dust clouds at specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains at certain points off the southern California coast.
It is possible that total rainfall above 50 mm may be recorded, which could lead to smaller waste streams and slippery paths.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Tropical rain will begin arriving in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread out to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be several major temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain fairly warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The central region of the U.S. on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected to start in October with heat throughout much of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern Plains area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there is a good chance that above-average temperatures will be recorded in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh’s statement
More than 20 million viewers watched Thursday the exciting testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony was relayed to six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting the usual Friday schedule due to a turn of events at the last minute: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers are likely to have seen this testimony on Friday.
The company had an average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not immediately available to other chains that relayed the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has trouble calculating the people who see him from his office.
Put in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football playoff game or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly backed Kavanaugh's nomination, was the most-audienced channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day testimony, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest remains high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was in trouble by protesters as he tried to climb into an elevator to go to a courtroom view.
Flake remained for several minutes with his eyesight down as he was being filmed live on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said, “You have power, but there are so many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would have more to say in view of the committee.
Within hours, all cable and broadcast channels were already broadcasting live at the time the Judicial Affairs Committee was to vote whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate to be put to a vote.
Flake said, instead, that he would only do so by understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee ahead of next week, a condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was influential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “playing politics” in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the UK’s future and scorning national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson bolstered his attack on Chequers’ so-called Brexit plan, where he says the proposal that Britain and the EU collect taxes from each other is “absurd.”
Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Suspected Dyteon Simpson for the Death of LSU Team Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was a member of the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison for second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene of the crime and claim they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to the CBS WAFB affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted that Wayde had been shot dead, according to police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge district coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday, claiming the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Forensics Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens for the help they provided in the investigation that culminated in this arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the area's law enforcement for their "diligence and for seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU team basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "broken" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong one".
“Things like this are the ones that make you suffer at all times,” Wade said.
A volcano spit ash in Mexico City
The ash splattered by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was supervising several recent upheavals and tremors.
Images on social networks where you can see a thin layer of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-poaching police and thousands of people joined opposing demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on their secession.
A group of pro-independence individuals held by the anti-swallowing police began to throw them eggs and powder paint, causing the appearance of dark dust clouds in the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later that day, there were clashes with the police, who used their batons to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “Don’t forget, don’t forgive” face to face with unionist protesters shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not eased in this independence-minded region a year after a referendum was held on October 1 considered illegal by Madrid but equally carried out by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a very large majority, although the turnout rate was low, as opponents of secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by entering electoral colleges throughout the region, which led to violent clashes.
Independence groups camped out all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the pro-independence demonstration along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the possibilities for Catalonia to achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw how my parents were crying out for joy at being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, albeit by a small margin, in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, since many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or detained waiting to be judged by their role in the organization of the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been revived by politicians of both sides.
“The tension is only increasing,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Presenting yourself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and the repression that we have seen on the part of the Spanish government,” he says.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Embedding a House in a Car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly attacked a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone has fired a crossbow at the car.
A move from Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston was a win.
Livingston, who had climbed this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what is hardly Steven Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as head coach of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's move made a difference, as, with this victory, Gary Holt's team climbed to second place, which they shared with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's, on the other hand, continue to win away from home in the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they are separated by a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Vienna Rapid in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends their unbeaten streak to six games in the league, with Holt as coach still not knowing what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
The Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the direct game of the visitors
Holt's team should have gone in front of the scorer long before the goal, since their direct play caused all sorts of problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way between the defense, but squandered his chance when he found himself in front of the goal. Later, Alan Lithgow sent the ball out on stretching to try to finish the head pass of Craig Halkett, who crossed the goal.
The locals would already be fine to let the Rangers approach their area, as they knew they could put visitors in trouble on isolated plays.
And that’s how this decisive goal came about.
The referee fouled against the Rangers' interests and Livingston made an opening for the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play the first and finish from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated possession, but found an impenetrable defenseman and goalkeeper Liam Kelly having very little work throughout the game,
The stage was repeated in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a merit stop.
For his part, Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped with his feet on an occasion from Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up diverting another combination move from Livingston.
The Rangers hung balls over and over in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for Halkett's supposed entry into substitute Glenn Middleton, and one by hand. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man believes that they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this ascendant trajectory.
His playing style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top category, although much of the merit has to be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good group of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be on Menga's guard throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite the brilliant moments shown with Gerrard as coach, they have definitely not been able to maintain the level.
They did not know how to create occasions (only once they clearly outperformed the local defense), and that the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Reception for Erdogan in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from congregating outside the mosque, although a large number of supporters gathered around it to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan, many of them Kurds, were also heard while condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinion around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and labeled a dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: A cyclist dies when he hit a car
A cyclist died as a result of a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedic services attended the cyclist, he died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a leaked car crash on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the crash site on Saturday.
Metropolitan police have said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to their closest relatives.
The street has been cut off and deviations have been applied for bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security men's prison, according to the center's office.
The events occurred in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. local time, and still continue.
Specialized "tornado" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight inmates have been involved. The avalot may have been contained on one side.
The officers had to be treated for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
According to a spokesman for the prison service: "We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to try to solve an incident that occurred in the Long Martin prison, which is still ongoing.
Six employees had to be treated with injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to be held accountable to the police and may have to spend even more time in the jail.”
The Long Lartin prison contains more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was learned that the prison head had to be treated in a hospital after being attacked by a recluse.
In addition, in October last year, anti-poaching agents made a presence in the prison to solve a serious altercation in which staff of the center were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major flooding (drunk areas could benefit)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen early next week when what is left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and approach it on Monday night with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression within a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was 64 km from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas that are out of risk of floods, the Rosa rain could become very good news, since the region suffers a severe drought.
Although the floods are a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, as the southwestern region is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, more than 40% of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane force on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which causes it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with tropical storm strength in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "total rainfall is expected from 75 to 150 mm from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm."
After this, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
“The main risk we expect from Rosa or what’s left of her is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the U.S.,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
Rainfall is expected to cause dangerous streams and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempt to Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stung in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area, around 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he was "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The agents have made a call so that anyone who may have some kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone can get in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'has suffered the pettiness and anger' of Democratic party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to reject the merciless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in an election in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexually abusing her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified on sight in relation to his ally.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw Kavanaugh’s genius, human quality and bravery.”
“The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable track record of serving the public,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of the Republican voter turnout index in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from some of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m actually going,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for our great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are engaged in “resisting and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, an assistant to Republican party leaders has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that has hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters struck the coast at sunset, dragging many people to death and destroying everything they found in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and they didn't run right away. That's why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it ripped apart everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed up a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency show the number of shops and buildings destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Rebellions continued to rock this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographic features of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
According to Nugroho, the casualties and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and therefore no information came from Donggala," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse,” he says.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although agents said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a fan shared on social media, you can feel like a man located on the top floor of a building gives desperate shouts of warning to the people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water bursts into the sea, taking away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in electricity supply that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say the evacuees continue to desperately need food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where the employees lay down in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the bleak gesture of starting relief work, some people complained that humanitarian workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, provisions and staffing from abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says ‘well, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start asking for international assistance, but that level has not yet been declared.”
While the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing people held out the hope that the miracle would occur and their loved ones would evade the bleak account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was rescued trapped in a dip.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community circulated, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think that means the messages weren’t received,” he added.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling ATM in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man “ran up behind the Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "To be formally known as Kanye West."
It was a while ago that the 41-year-old West mobbed him with the nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she is expected to present her new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance for "emotional reasons," according to the show's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think you’re the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s you, it’s us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the only thing, to simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good side, our bad side, our confused side, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, has used his nickname with or without script and capital letters.
Mexico's President AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, when the country is short of celebrating the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco square that "military force would never be used again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and killed 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds earmarked for AI.
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it spends on research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures on AI, despite the country's general lack of formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the world’s No. 1 for AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next breakthroughs in the field of AI,” Lee said.
“Doubling funding could double the opportunities for the U.S. to make the next big discovery in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that outperformed the top-ranked American Othello player and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee positively valued previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
“Often, American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, “It’s not China that takes the academic leaders; it’s the companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university eminences to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that America’s work in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
“I think permanent residency cards should be automatically offered to PhD students in AI,” he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
“China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the U.S. Foundation of Natural Sciences and other public agencies give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve collaborators from industry and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently allocates more than 100 million USD per year to research in AI.
In the meantime, no measures have been applied in connection with U.S. legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim of its territory and has banned it from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign is questioning whether the minimum 50% participation required for the referendum to be valid will be reached.
The question stated in the referendum’s ballot is: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that was created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely in the hands of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
“I’ve come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the change of name of the country, which would open the way for him to join the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by the people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the head up, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
Zaev said that a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future”.
In a poll released Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required turnout.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV, 57% of the respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote “yes.”
In order for the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero scores a goal after battling Brighton’s entire defense
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling canceled Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win in the match at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) last Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a move that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentinian forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He marched by speed between three Brighton defenses, sweeping him through the playing field.
Agüero was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He haggled a defender before overtaking a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He then went to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward turned the ball on the first touch, inside the area, to Agüero, who with his right leg beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a shot that stuck inside the net on the right side.
“Agüero is in trouble at the foot,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided to play for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the lead in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal reached the 29th minute.
In that move, Agüero received the ball in depth on the Brighton field and
He made a lovely pass into space on the left-hand side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling along the pole.
The Sky Blues forward finished the ball inside the net before exiting the bottom line.
City face off Tuesday at Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League, at 6:55 p.m., at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Joker, without options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off fight, there was little reason to force another opening.
But highly competitive Scherzer hopes to hit the pitcher's mound next Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have a chance to play the play-offs.
The Rockies secured a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to win their first division title.
“Although we don’t play at all, at least we can go out and get to know the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably play each point at the highest level, like no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?”
The Nationals have yet to announce an opener launcher by Sunday, but are apparently determined to let Scherzer launch if this situation arises.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a warm-up session on Thursday and pitched on Sunday, on his usual day off.
The right-hand shooter from Washington has an 18-7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 knockouts per strike in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
It’s five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the great, great.. I don’t introduce myself, but actually I do introduce myself. That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all the means necessary, their meanness is seen, their evil intentions.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control. But we won’t give them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to “resist and obstruct”.
“And this can be seen in the last four days,” he shrieked, and called the Democrats “angry, mean, gross, and false.”
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which sparked a strong public outcry.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, eh, no. Wait a minute... This was a very bad expression of body language, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse party.
He is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I wasn’t surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of British parliamentarians to whom we have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she spoke out with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the notice of the Labour Party’s Friday meeting in Nottingham, it was announced that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of “more generous and kind” policies has long been forgotten, if at all.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged based on whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision expected me to take a 180-degree turn and take positions he would never have taken, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, center policies are denounced and I am told it should not be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the messages I receive are usually political.
I’m impressed by the professionalism and determination of the colleagues who face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they don’t get blown away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of “non-confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party became tighter.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and I have been advised to keep my head down, not to be so expressive and “everything would be fine”.
But I didn’t get into politics for that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my student days, stimulated by Thatcher’s negligent government, which left my entire class literally sunk, I’ve tried to advocate better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councilor or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our utilities, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent them from acting, in my opinion, in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr lead the way
Two last-minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved victory in this vibrant match of Tennent's Premiership day.
The Ayr, who are the only unbeaten team of the ten, occupy the first position on the leaderboard.
In the end, the local team won thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they were better able to take advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
“The games we’ve played so far have put us to the test and we’re still beaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “Congratulations to the Ayr, they’ve taken advantage of the opportunities better than we do.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed ahead of the Ayr, but a yellow card for the Scottish international Rory Hughes, ceded to the Warriors, allowed the Melroses to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended the Ayr's advantage with a penalty and, just in the middle, scored and converted an essay to put the score 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But the Melroses started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, narrowed the differences to five points.
Afterwards, the match was interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired in bed, and in the dam the Ayr extended the distance again with an essay by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Substitute captain Blair Macpherson was then cautioned with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of heavy pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a plating at Climo without a ball, from the penalty lineup, MacPherson scored a backlash behind the piercing mole of the Ayr.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to the third row of Gregor Henry to score the fifth round of the local team.
The Still Game star seems to be ready to start a new career in the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, appears to be poised to move into the hospitality industry after he is found to have been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comic partner.
The duo have announced that season nine will be the last in the series, and it appears that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a source in The Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "blühende catering sector".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, landlocked, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol their naval covered with eixarcia in La Paz.
Public buildings have a navy blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are pampered with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
Retrieving it is a duty.”
Across Bolivia’s landlocked territory, the memory of a lost coastline facing Chile in a cruel resource conflict in the 19th century remains as vivid as the longing to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, it goes without saying, it expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IJT’s resolution on large screens across the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is forced to negotiate the concession of a sovereign sea departure for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has many hopes set in Monday's resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said last August.
However, some analysts believe that the Tribunal is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia and that if it did, things would not change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The IJT’s resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations were filed, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, the Bolivian cause may have experienced a setback in the past four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has seized the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
“The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally quick.
Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crossroads.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he said.
“Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen Unless It Can Trust the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The minister urged the United States to keep promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is set to resume stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a chimera to think that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War could make North Korea kneel.
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament moves beforehand.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of oversized hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look for more.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been devastated by very impractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a wide, feather-shaped wing that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were enjoined watermelons, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the brightly colored masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a complete scuba diving team, with tubes and glasses, while another resembled a molten ice cream cone.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The oversized hats tread the heels of “the Bomb,” a two-foot wide-winged straw hat that everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread through social networks brought another great creation to the catwalk: a straw bag for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed in a bathing suit that wore it.
The raffia bag, dark orange, adorned with raffia laces and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’s La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope to see people wearing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we can not depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest grades in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the upper A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are kept in the same regard as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that because employers found it difficult to fill vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of which career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find an important job.
In Scotland, there is diversity between schools in terms of the languages they teach.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, you can always choose from a number of languages in independent schools, which have teaching staff specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In today’s global trading environment, there is no denying that languages continue to be of vital importance to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered “international communicative competences”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It has to be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we still have to figure out the minutes he’ll play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump aims to win support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump rally in West Virginia can be viewed online at the link below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to approach this week’s hearing with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense over allegations of sexual abuse he faces, while the Senate’s expected confirmation vote is held on hold for up to a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans running in the delicate November election gain momentum.
President Trump’s five campaign rallies scheduled for next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and enlarge the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is as important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, as we head into a jammed campaign season," a Trump spokesman said.
Tonight’s rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together supporters “from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a boost in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the American team shows its ambition to keep the hopes alive in the face of the individual matches on Sunday
After three unequal sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging dynamics pendulum is an invented sporting concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on which side is the positive dynamic now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I think we’re on a small positive streak,” Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by Spieth and Justin Thomas' state of form, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is setting an example.
Celebration guttural cries rose in intensity as he continued his lap and it became a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the match in hole 15 with a similar shout, of the kind that indicates that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
“You have to do your best and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave footprints.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup sensation.
The strange but adorable European couple carry four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way its energy seems to flow to and from the bustling public, it is reaffirmed that it is the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who partnered with Alex Noren.
A madman and two doubles in the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and Swede into a hole from which they never had any choice.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see from the interactions between the pairings, the tips they give and the ones they don’t, and the way a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the US, had questioned.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable lead after finishing the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a struggling Tiger Woods and leave their record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated a poorly-matched American team in the morning fourballs and put the series 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but could not narrow the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in the 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they called a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, rejoined Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2:1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have everything in mind on a pleasant and windy day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2-to-1 win against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, and later again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-to-3 in the foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team had scored a four-point difference to individual matches, although Furyk's defending team only needed to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second-best for two days, it looks like a coming Sunday counterattack is out of their reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm "in any way" if signs of trust are not appreciated
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions were escalating its distrust of the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” in the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“We don’t see any response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not unilaterally initiate disarmament in any way.”
While Ri resumed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it gradually took action, his statements seemed significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization altogether, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US acting president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has communicated that before Pyongyang must eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that denuclearization must first occur and raises the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective coercively, in addition to opposing the “declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are escalating our distrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the party involved in the issue of denuclearization were South Korea instead of the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnation situation.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from what he delivered last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President “Mr. Evil” Trump called Kim “Rocket Man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much to do and sanctions had to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The application of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization.”
The Security Council has pushed sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that advances had been made, but within a few hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took “measures in line.”
He said Kim had told him that the “measures in line” he sought were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on resting habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of studying all night long, stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar noted that students at the world’s number one university are often misguided about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why do they tell me this now, all this, in my last year?’
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are explained the basic concepts on how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students must click on coffee cups, curtains, dolls and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how it affects sports performance to lack of sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of staying awake all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure students face make sleep deprivation an ever-growing problem.
Making sure you enjoy good quality sleep for long enough should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask graduate students to undertake a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact that they set an alarm when going to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the detrimental effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston that means another stumble outside.
The Ibrox team was looking to add their first home win since last February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second loss to Gerrard in 18 games as coach to leave his team adrift, 8 points from the Ladbrokes Hearts, unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premier.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the halfway point, and it never seemed that the Rangers, uninspired, were about to equal the score.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, the Livingston rise to third place, behind the Hibernian for goal difference.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention from a head injury caused by an object that was apparently thrown from the lawn.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that wiped out the Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven starters who started a point against the Hearts last week. Surely, he was satisfied by the way his well-organized team choked his rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated possession, the Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two-minute game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Alan McGregor, but the midfielder sidestepped and squandered the big opportunity.
A blunt foul throw from Keaghan Jacobs stumbled upon Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot to the posterior pole.
The Rangers took control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a penalty on the fifteen-minute sign, as he and Steven Lawless ran into it, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only led two shots to the first part, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and docile forward Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's first act on the 34th minute might have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' hard-working move.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple finale.
Gerrard acted in the pause when changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent. The change had an almost immediate impact, as the end made a pass to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran to the blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to catch the attention of visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes one after the other.
Holt's band may have given way to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a diverted shot from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still requested a last penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day that the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device we know as the "Geiger counter".
The Geiger counter, which has been a pillar of science ever since, also became a staple of pop culture, such as the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, seemingly failed cowboy physicists:
“What the hell is this?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted from radioactivity to the minerals.”
Evans: "It's definitely exploding now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” and Remove Malignant Cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer she had gone missing for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: “The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein “promotes the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West caught up in a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL show.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a make America Great Again cap, he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“Whenever I talk to white people, they say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated behind the scenes because of the hat he wore.
“They threatened me behind the scenes.
I was told not to go out with that hat on.
They harassed me.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" as he said he would put on Superman's cloak so they wouldn't be able to tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
“Try to love.”
His comments provoked audience writing at least twice and the show's team members seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, who had a reporter explaining to the publication: "The whole study was completely mute."
West acted as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-rapper Mac Miller had been dead for a few days.
West left much of the audience bewildered with the performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West got the backing of conservative TPUSA group boss Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR DISCOVERING BETWEEN THE MULTITUDE."
But the show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that he's absolutely wonderful."
“But I have chosen not to reward someone (buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that hurts my community.
He is free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "the one formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the missing Prince music legend changed his name to a symbol and later the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusation of murder in attempted stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed Friday in eastern Belfast.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast court of first instance on Monday.
Prosecutors will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the male hero stereotype, saying these roles hint that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said he believed "something had gone wrong" and that he was questioning how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of ?MeToo.
Kit, who has recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted she feels quite determined to tackle this problem.
“Personally, now I wonder where we’ve been wrong about masculinity,” he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?"
According to Kit, television can have some responsibility for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very manly characters.
He added: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this facet of virility?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
"Something's definitely gone wrong with the kids."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for next summer, saying he is fed up with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best he has ever provided Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life on,” she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the family estate in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV for this cause has fallen to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination from the LGBT collective is common.
Taking into account the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have same-sex relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked Republican Party senators’ data and dismantles “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the demands were driven by critics and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was posted by an unknown person in the Capitol during a Senate committee session on sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staffer, the Capitol reported.
“This baseless allegation is completely false and a pure lie,” Waters continued.
“My staff member, the identity, personal data and security of which have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent allegations, was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a pure invention.”
Waters' statement quickly generated criticism online, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of outrage,” Fleischer wrote.
"That makes him think he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
You don’t have to be defiant.
You don’t have to question the accuser’s motives.
You have to keep calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to liken Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“Important if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces to these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the offenders are revealed and that they are held legally responsible for all actions that have been taken and that have harmed each and every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review: Rowan Atkinson's Limited Spy Parody
It is already traditional to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this remake of Johnny English's action-comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Will this humorous self-satisfaction about how despicable we are be a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the incompetent out-of-eye and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to twist it all. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking territories with the tradition of going to the cinema.
Evidently, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a stitch of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the inaugural ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson who represented Barclaycard's now-forgotten television ads, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good times on this last trip.
I loved the Johnny English who approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the blades of the propeller were attached to his helmet.
He sees Atkinson's gift for physical comedy, but humor seems rather fluid and oddly superfluous, especially because "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults and, to me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the dumb gags of the character Mr. Bean who represents Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British super-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the service agent's dismay, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and beleaguered figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character modelled on Teresa-May, but the script does not reach any further.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as each active spy is put in danger, he will have to recover some retired.
And that includes clumsy Johnny English, now employed as a teacher at some luxury institution, but teaching unofficial classes on how to become a undercover agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers an espionage academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency reunion with his sequestered sufferer Bough, a role that reprises Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of when things get very ugly in Her Majesty's Secret Service go into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous follies: dressed as waiters, setting fire to a French fast-food restaurant, sowing chaos smuggling aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English sparks great confusion when they try to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all seems like a children's program.
Quite normal things.
As with Johnny English's other films, it hasn't been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that justifies his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan for the British to have a four-day work week and cover five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to pass on the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them one more day of celebration.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the party’s economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The four-day shift is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won’t be overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that fits the party’s perspective of balancing the economy for the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration together at present.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it.”
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to utilities.
The minister’s shadow plans also imply that shareholders of water companies might not recover all of the investment, as the Labour government could apply “deductions” for the crimes I perceived.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector firms’ shares to employees, who expect to funnel annual dividends worth up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, and raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring up something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I’m serious,” Kennedy said.
"In the session I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it all happened and the accusations went public, and I asked him if he had done so.
He was strong, determined, and secure.”
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
“I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would file an explosive charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people you name will be able to verify it.
He is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, featuring an absolutely stunning star program, which carries out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
This year’s Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What successes has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years left to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case of what we call “clictivism” (people who think it makes a difference to sign a petition online or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters, which have helped achieve several goals.
It states that these actions have helped spur global leaders to announce commitments and policies comparable to more than $37 billion, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2.2 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that protected funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based association of investors and filmmakers, which pledges to “help children grow as much as possible” and promises to send Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition’s ambassador, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of his website’s P+Fs asking “what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen replied, “It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will feature Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a “blockade” to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington can, "if necessary" turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
“The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for blockade, to prevent its energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are effectively equal.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, noting that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will “detentiously think” about her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "detaine" her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government split, for women to hold high office,” Hill said.
“After November 6, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.”
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he was “bringing the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been candid in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "It's clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election."
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters believed he should not be running by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters have said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed wider support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites affected by PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“With what my own son has been going through since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from PTSD ramifications and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers are returning with,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following about his son and other war veterans: "They become a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of alcohol, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district presented an amicus curiae Friday in Washington to support a policy-defying asylum seeker, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent gang member" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation.”
Federal laws require applications for asylum to be adjudicated according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and this prohibition infringes this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that policy denying immigration harms the U.S. economy as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide needed jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
“Asylee is available to those people who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never sought to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her feverish son in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There is a lack of drinking water.”
Residents have been seen returning to their homes destroyed to grab flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are treated outside because of the heavy jolts that are repeated.
Tears denied him as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
“I heard my wife cry for help and then I didn’t hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassing itself with “propaganda ads.”
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily's payment supplement on Wednesday at The Des Moines Register, Iowa's top-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, an accusation China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase of Washington’s campaign to intensify pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to insert ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen tariffs rise on mutual imports.
China's vengeful tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters from states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China’s Branstad wrote in an op-ed in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: “It is doubling the harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press by inserting a paid advertisement in The Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you’ll find few discrepant voices and you won’t see any real reflection of the disparate views that Chinese citizens may have on China’s worrisome economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers shunned the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans push women voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault lawsuits, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans already officially show that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can’t be undone,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that last-minute pressure from Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation to be conducted is enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate lobby while Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will stay off the chart," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they’ve already been tall; it’s true.
But they could have been more, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who often don’t vote as long as they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, detailing his sexual assault claims to the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the GOP,” former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits in the defendants’ bench. It’s also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they’ve treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the scale slightly settling to the last.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents doubtlessly or likely believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they doubtlessly or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or indubitably lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed the same from Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the lawsuits filed by Ford and at least another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was "to dominate the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the emerging company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They’re all available in one browser at a time.
What is exclusive to personal online data storage is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is for the company to integrate the right resources, processes and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some in-house developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said no one on his team is talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely emptied overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the Victory Cross of the I GM
The only clergyman in the Church of England to win a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. and Rev. Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons unearthed a memorial tombstone at a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone appeared exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns".
He later ran towards the line of fire and, with "the utmost courage", advanced the line before throwing himself over a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment stunned.
The lieutenant colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never match, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by the support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who fell asleep all night to watch Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you stay up all night to see Bellator 206 and refuse to see the most important event.
The San Jose poster contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and had to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for the showdown, viewers in the UK were stunned when the schedule changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted to have spent the night awake until the morning to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to cartoons as "a kind of vomiting acubitus."
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they switched to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppe la porceta, yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won’t be able to resolve it until Sunday at our own time, Monday at yours.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We tried to show it to the followers again, but it was over.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ About Sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father had left him with the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off for illness.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" the others because "it wasn't socially acceptable like boys and girls".
“To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when you end up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to discriminate against homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American director, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you go through it when you are young (he participated in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple were parents in June of a boy who was given the name Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "his whole perspective" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold,” he said.
“There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father would not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Father, you won't be there to occupy the front row,'" he said.
“As I grabbed his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he was not invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home at an Olympics. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Proud by Heather Small), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympic Games and which was still putting on his chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worsening Mickelson showed up at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change his physical state if he does not want to become an unhappy record.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments divides his time between being an animator and working on his game on the field, in hopes of rectifying what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the peak of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult career of Le Golf National, where the long rough usually punishes the deviated blows.
And if his own track record isn’t daunting enough, Mickelson will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down when starting the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson's game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
“He perfectly understood his role for that day, he patted me on the back and he shook my arm as he told me he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how he trained and that's how we thought we should move forward.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that has not matched its individual record.
Mickelson has scored 18 wins, 20 defeats and 7 draws, though Furyk has said his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, joking, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great partner for the team,” she said.
“I think the younger players were also having fun hanging out with him this week, which was fun to see.
It brings a lot more to your game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage may soon fade away
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, when the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they managed to win by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"And you keep remembering that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Golfderrama, where we won, but for a short while," said Bjorn, in the picture, after seeing the team's victory in 2018 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score at Le National.
The story has taught me and all the members of the team that it’s not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go to the whole machine.
You have to go out and do everything right.
This doesn’t end until the points go up on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, we try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I’ve already said, I focus on the 12 players we have in the team, but I also have in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world.”
Delighted by the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: “I will never rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything is going well, but individual duels put your ability to play golf to the fullest.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself.”
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin over last-day pickups, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he said, answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start on a good foot, as we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We’ve prepared the alignment based on the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is challenged to try to start the payout against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I’ve chosen this order because I think it covers all the possibilities,” Bjorn says of his selection for individual matches.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The new German Navy frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it will not do so until at least next year due to faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have set the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technology against stealth actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other highlights include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continued delays imply that the avant-garde ships, which were expected to project into Germany as a powerful force abroad, will be obsolete by the time they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Hamburg shipyard Blohm & Voss.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipbuilder once it had been delivered.
Few details of the reasons for his return are known, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that rendered it useless if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are significant, as approximately 120 sailors, half the crew needed for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to weigh twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes training the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached an astonishing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of €2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, given recent warnings that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used".
The official said the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were no longer used, but no new ones were provided as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spying on the secret life of bats
A new research carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
The findings are expected to provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help with future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common bats, as well as northern ear bats and water in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track bats’ activities during the season.
Volunteers and staff of the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The sound analysis of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Construction and restoration of buildings threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do paper flies and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren’t really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo locating technique to locate insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts with the proper training, who carry out surveys, inspections of nests and, sometimes, rescues on a regular basis.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve on the Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The administrator of the estate, David Thompson, states that it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here at Threave, we have a big area for bats,” he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
Notes the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young, which could result in the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, annoy and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said: “We still have to learn a lot from bats, and in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data on their population.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape against him “fake news” and said people “want to become famous” thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the accusations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 at the time to not make the incident public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations went public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed they were “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball on camera.
“They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I’m a happy man and everything is in order,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have described as “inadmissible information of suspicions about privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Las Vegas Palms Hotel and Casino.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed at Clark County Courthouse.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except for a "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but were consented.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of reprisals" and worried "about being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he has signed for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'would always regret' losing car makers
The UK would “always regret it” if it lost its status as a world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, last year produced 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal by the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade will work with the rest of the EU countries has awakened the fears of other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is made on a “just in time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and European Union suppliers for car manufacturing.
If the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, there may be border riots, which the sector believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a result.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls.”
"We need to come to an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“Tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.”
Toyota could not confirm how long production would stop, but in the long run, it has warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of Unite the Union at the plant, said members are starting to be very concerned about the situation: "From experience, when they lose these jobs, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: “We have devised a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump’s long-awaited meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “paused for a week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues in White House statements on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, Russian ties and aid to Trump, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fired the deputy attorney general and jeopardized Mueller’s independence has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of bringing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump has said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but he postponed the meeting to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified to.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be delayed one more week for all matters with the supreme court.
But we’ll see. I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters might refute this claim: Sanders has not held any White House briefings since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he did not like the fanfare of television journalists, although he said: "I will not deny that they are fanfares".
He suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, before adding the following without citing any source: “We have consulted this data.”
Sanders said the briefings will continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and it will replace briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on official visit.
Individual press releases are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at times, strange in front of the assembled journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service amid fears about Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wishes them to continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after Britain’s departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of state-of-residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and everything seems set for the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know these are turbulent times for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues in the EU, and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, while benefiting the patients and communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a relay of the Tennessee State Tigers, has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to reports from Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed said the injury occurred shortly before the halfway point.
“He came to the band line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing it on a bunk bed and taking it for further testing.
A Tennessee State officer reported Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had gone out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's Abercrombie's first season, year two, with Tennessee State after joining from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new Conservative Party plans.
This action will neutralize the success of the Corbyn movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp tax will be taxed on those people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The U.S. Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged a higher timbre tax when buying a property in the UK and this money will be used to help homeless people, a move Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taxed on those people and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will be allocated to the government’s action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second homes and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
The company expects to earn up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s new-build properties are from non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to make their way to the property scale.
Many of the country's affluent areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the bell tax to help young people have their first home.
She accused the big buildings of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a number of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls over rent and the completion of "no fault" divestments.
It also wants to give more power to municipalities to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is equally easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to hard-working British people.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the indignity of homeless people makes everything even more real.”
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to coach Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old has accepted the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the League One, three points from the leader.
He made it to Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned once as a supporter and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching a lot playing Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was little and it’s always something that makes me go back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I’m successful in training clubs, though.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn't feel the pressure of being next on a list of consecrated names on such a large team, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For now, my criterion for measuring my success will be whether I can get this team back into the Premier League.
With the club’s structure and facilities, it’s clear that their place is the Premier League.”
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would only consider that I’ve been successful here if I can get the club back.”
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a stint as second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching corps at Hearts.
He helped Alloa avoid the descent into the third category and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his time playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a decisive moment,” he recalled about accepting the position at Alloa.
“I always thought training was the best thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it well, I got along reasonably and I enjoyed enough good times there.
But playing can be very hard.
There are a lot of things you have to overcome each week.
I’m still going through things like the stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the most comfortable time I’ve felt since I was an adult.”

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has triggered consumption in struggling bars in Britain, but has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have achieved a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA, the company that has collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sunshine and the participation of England in the World Cup, which has extended more than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to June, with the increase of 2.8% still in the bars, except for the patio.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in June restaurants has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have obtained the best results, while the consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered with the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
People just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6% over the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM’s leisure and hospitality analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors related to sales of the foreign leisure market.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, but a decline in sales of 4.8% year-on-year would be especially detrimental, rather than the continued cost pressure.
“This long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-serving businesses and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide that much-needed breath.”
The total increase in bar and restaurant sales, including those opened recently, was 2.7% in July, indicating the slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sector sales indicator for restaurants, bars and taverns in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of more than 9 million pounds and is the established benchmark of the sector.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers, according to survey data.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "fake Insta" pages
News has raised fears about posting sexual content
20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in “fake Insta” accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a “main” net account that they show to their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Private Schools (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years old have two profiles, of which half have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the directive of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation's executive board at the organization's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most medal-winning track and field athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm very much looking forward to acting as the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to grow the sport and contribute to it in Scotland."
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular BBC commentator, was barred from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what degree.
It’s been exhausting, but I’ve recovered completely, I’ve come back to learning to walk and today it’s time to do agility exercises!
Thanks for the encouragement!”
A billboard ad that compares mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A cartoonist has shared her opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows who move.
To mark the launch of what is billed as the “world’s first silent pullout,” consumer tech company Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a joking music video to showcase the freedom the new pullout gives to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of fodder and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I'll mumble myself, but you won't see a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not bridesmaids, but my breasts".
The return continues: "Pump, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, munyo girls."
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from viewers, many of whom claim it shows the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference being that they are separated from their babies a few days after they give birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie strap discreetly hides in a breast bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “Comprehensively traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a tirade for mothers who will keep their babies?”
Another user added, “It’s an out-of-place ad.”
Other people defended the announcement; one woman admitted that she found the song "fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Pumping for the tyre made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as it is.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who pump with pull-outs (usually at their workplace or in the toilet and feel like they're cows.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the strap discreetly placed on the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like they are cows when using the pulley.
However, the Elvie strap is completely silent, has no cable or tube and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, which gives women more freedom to move around, hold babies and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood developer at Mother, said: “The Elvie Tire is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
In tracing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a pull-out is used and the challenges it entails doing so, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pull-out.
It's not the first time Elvie has been in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Quietly Moved to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of children withheld has risen even though monthly entries across the border have remained virtually stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid to put their chances of staying in the country at risk if they decided to host a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective godparents and the rest of adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking officer with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to take in unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80 percent of the people who have taken in or live in the home of a person they have taken in are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to persecute these people,” Albence said.
To prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their case to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
Anyone who is not eligible for help will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent flashbacks or escape attempts, according to workers and reports released by the system in recent months.
Lawyers say these concerns can be heightened in larger facilities, such as Screw, where signs that a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as deputy prime minister, has stated that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly".
“They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged all Syrian territory" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a country hit by the war.
On the refugee issue, Muallem said conditions were good for his return and blamed “some Western countries” for spreading “irrational fears” that keep refugees away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats have said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russian help in the province, where three million people live.
Muallem said the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed hope that military action will face jihadists, who include al-Qaeda-linked fighters from the Nusra Front, who will be "eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to begin shaping a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections again in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, the scandals and the impeachment process end his presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be “the end of a more dramatic presidency in history.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in peak viewing hours has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in peak viewing hours, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“People have been dumped because they don’t understand it,” says Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet decree that becomes the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
"He told me that because it made him laugh," Scovell told me.
There is an entertainment point in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to come together and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go further when you find yourself in the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “private use” sources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar cloakskin jacket (“a piece of his clothes as thick as he was”).
In my case, I will never see Super Mario again.
“Part of what it looks like to be part of a reality show is that it gives you something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the character changes and script twists of Trump’s show.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and it was alone outside the house it has on the north coast of Kauai, but it was locked up watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
It could not be disengaged, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a wire.
“I remember when we did those blundered programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it would be a joke, but I think they were right.”

Foreign money floods races in midterm elections in the tighter House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that there will be a cash flood in the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the re-alignment of congressional districts that has caused two current members to compete for the same square.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburgh involves Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won the place in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which conflicts with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the party's main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in a closely followed special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
US imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but withdraws them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners threw out the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions on failing to recognize Taiwan," department spokesman Heather Nauert said this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received US aid of 140 million dollars in 2017, was contemplated, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death toll from murder and unemployment.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending with any likelihood of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to their positions in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations from anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study history
The next event to occur could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is numerous evidence in public records.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in his attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the body, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don’t want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European names, is inevitable.
Decisions must be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over points of inflection like this and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The United States is currently facing several points of inflection.
What if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water on his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating that he was not fit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times' information isn't accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And especially, will we vote in the middle of the legislature for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don’t pass these tests, democracy will begin to run a risk.
But I don’t think we’ll fail, because I’ve already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador’s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With that in mind, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans, of the Rangers, optimistic about the match against the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw in the field of the Vila-real this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify in the group of G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first few minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villa Real, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for great results.
“It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
"We played the game believing that we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten something more out of it in the end, but overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it’s another great European night.
We hope to be able to keep the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they got a good result in the last match, but I am sure we will give everything and get a good result with the support of the fans.
“Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The team is fine and the guys enjoy it, the trainings are good.
I hope we can give it all away, leave it behind last season and be successful.”
Women lose sleep for fear of retirement savings
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be looked after, few people talked about it with their family.
Approximately half of respondents nationwide say they have talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they had spoken to their children.
“People want some family members to take care of them, but they don’t dare think about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
We have to start there.
Talk to your partner and your children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover expenses, or your own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the step into the legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notarial authority for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of disability.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly family member has a medical emergency and is on his or her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“Finance is not the only factor to be determined, but also which doctors you want to treat with,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
“Have this plan ready.”
Man shot several times with a compressed air shotgun at Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots from a compressed air gun as he returned home after going out for the night.
The victim, in his early 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
"Officials have described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (on British summer time), as a 'random act'.
The victim did not see his attacker.
His life is not in danger from injuries and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities. The death toll is expected to rise.
As communications are cut off, the relief units have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closer to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Celebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Celebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Celebes.
The Regency, an administrative region lower than a province, had an approximate population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Celebes Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami occurred west of Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt and earthquakes are usually produced there on a certain frequency.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Ace province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that shattered the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 rocked a pop area of the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died due to the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of large earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's Oldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she pulled her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Interim Detention Center, where he is being held with an unsecured bond of $500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he was pronounced "not guilty, for sure" when asked how he was pronounced, according to that chain.
Palin faces three class A offenses, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B failure, which can be punished with a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn’t the first time a criminal charge has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
Her husband said he had punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for associating her son’s violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake rocked the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The quake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social networks, videos are circulating with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for exceptional death penalty for New York terror suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary sentence that has not been applied to the state for a federal offense since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a West Side Highway bike lane on Lower Manhattan and to run over pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and that he "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could result in a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with a 22-foul indictment that included eight murder charges in favor of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's actions as "inhuman, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they told investigators that they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea and a lifelong chain with no possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be in Charge of Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader has said politicians should “feel pressure from Eurosceptics” when one of Theresa May’s own members of parliament has suggested she should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted as pro-union conservatives have come forward in another anti-Brexit protest in La City.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers commitment plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, union supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will manage to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told Solihull's Leave Means Leave rally that he wanted to undo Chequers' engagement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out,” he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we must undo the Chequers commitment.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: “We did not fight world wars to be slavish.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British population has changed mindset and wants to stay is totally false.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: “I only tell you, Prime Minister, to listen to the people.”
“The Chequers commitment is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the streets and get us to win an election.
Give up the Chequers engagement and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said that the politicians of the rally must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.”
“We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country who gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of activists waved banners on conservatives against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives over security concerns they suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It has been a center of speculation about the possibility of lifting Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the open meeting format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it’s time for “women to go to Washington to fix our government that doesn’t work, and that includes a woman in the dome.”
A person arrested for the shooting of Sims, LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 ET press conference.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and called for collaboration to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head that ultimately killed him,” police officer Murphy J. Paul told media Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the scene, in possession of a gun, and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a junior 2-metre player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team orders hand him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and nearly exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into pits earlier and let Hamilton run with traffic on the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes later had to stop in the pits and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the free interior with the risk of being left out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap he was in seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position much of the race, as he retained his wheels to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen and move to fourth position.
He eventually entered the pits at lap number 44, but was unable to increase the pace in the next eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me pass.
The team has done a fantastic job of having an u-two,” Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday to insist she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that people are "painful, cruel and lying".
“One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry, bad, cruel and lying people,” she said.
“When you look at the reports and the leaks and they say, ‘No, it wasn’t me.
It wasn’t me.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... Did you leak the document? "Hey, what?
No, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we didn’t filter it,” she added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the claims against Ford's Kavanaugh in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s statements, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential as he asked.”
But his denial displeased the president, who commented at the rally on Saturday night: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the statements for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to have power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite defeat to the Belfast Giants, as they won the 5-3 return game at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately got a two-goal lead thanks to the finishes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised their team's level, but Dwyer later restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard matched the Dundee, and then Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had just won Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assist by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan repositioned the home team to the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer to the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game at the end of the second half and secured his team's fifth goal win near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after he died to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a large earthquake rocked the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many aftershocks in the area and there are many people trapped between the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his companions escaping to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his place in the tremulous control tower of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure Batik Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then, he left the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative for Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It broke my heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed," said Sutopo representative Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with an elevation of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, who will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the looters have been looted.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against the clock to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says a man has disappeared after the accident in the lagoon
The airline that operated a flight that was going to crash into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although they previously said that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday and they were all in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane landed in the lagoon because the runway was short.
Some witnesses believe that the plane passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was going very low.
“That was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water down the waist to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working nearby to upgrade a dock also assisted in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to land before the plane sank about 30 meters in the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline crashes recorded on PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these crashes.
An analyst writes a chronology of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution is concluding the case on Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to build the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said she received location data from different cellphones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted her earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the Sanford pickup that night, Sanford said he had lied since his pickup was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense plans to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to pass at the hands of the jury throughout the same day.
The High Breed: What Is Mindful Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed says hip-hop has strayed from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and put hip-hop consciously back in fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York babysitter sues couple for firing after 'racist' message
A nanny in New York has denounced a couple for a discriminatory farewell after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother where she protested because she was "another black person."
The couple denies that they are racist and compares the lawsuit to an “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay at seeing that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she got to work on her first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After noticing her puffiness, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nanny she had fired, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her day of work and then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice now claims compensation for her dismissal and claims compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month residency job for which she had been hired, even though there was no contract.
“I want to show you that you can’t do things like that,” he told the Post on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have responded to statements that they are racist while claiming that Maurice's firing was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they could not trust her after having offended her.
“My wife sent me something I didn’t want to say.
He's not racist.
We are not racist people,” Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to an "extortion," said his wife had two months left to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you going to pursue something like that?
It’s not a very kind attitude,” added the investor banker.
The legal case is still unresolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to report the couple on social networks and to condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first reads it before it's published.
It’s very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book about a small plywood bone, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and says that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
“He was a discreet man; he wasn’t a presumptuous one,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when your son gets something: you’re proud, even if it’s not your thing.
I think he considered Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to recognize Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
On landing, they rushed her daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nobody would call often to say that it was very serious and they didn't expect me to get over it," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I called Nad and he told me that he would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, pretty.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs that had been given to her for her body to continue beating were being consumed and were coming out of her system.
He had died earlier than expected, so everything was shut down.
I just had to sit down and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep the good shapes.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted from the experience that was going on.
“No one knew,” he said.
His head was bent and tears kept falling.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for the overwhelming Nad.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her very much.”
Women hang cards to stop suicides at a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, killed himself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, based in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile could illuminate any room.”
However, he quit his job before he died because he was at a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that there will be a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know that there are people they can turn to, that they can listen to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after Mark’s mother died.
“He never said he wasn’t well or that he was depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A couple of days before Christmas we observed a change in attitude.
He played deep on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their presents and he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to work on it: "Open a hole in the family.
It shatters us.
But we have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity," Mr. Flake said Saturday. He also added that he feared that the committee would be destroyed with the entrenched deadlock of supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
Only five weeks are left for the November 6 midterm elections. If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened when it comes to getting the man they want elected to arrive at the country's top courthouse.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and pressure them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to undo the draw and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean deserters "cou" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said there had been 1,127 defections last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
Usually, the vast majority of Northern defectors are offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul sources say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers migrant defectors illegal, rather than refugees, and often repatriates them forcibly.
North-South relations, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm unilaterally first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Says Brett Kavanaugh Is ‘Historical’ and Unfit to Work in High Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said High Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is "hysterical" and that his temperament incapacitates him to work in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted this way, she would have been told that she is a ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied accusations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and speechless while talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats and said the accusations against him amounted to a “grotesque and coordinated assassination of a character” organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the High Court, as it showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if it is confirmed, and if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“This is what I can say: if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you’re not only not able to be in the High Court, but also not in the court where you are now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about any decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she considers herself a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he sidestepped questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Superior Court.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to enter the courthouse and expect it to look wonderful,” Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It’s a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and you can’t get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. What about you?"
She continued, “I was really helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, telling the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it continued.
It seemed brilliant to me.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a male-majority office, where I once ended up crying with indescribable rage, is that of an older woman (a cold directive that had always terrified me a little bit) who grabbed me from the buttocks and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad because they’ll have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Colorado Democrat at the time, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me as he laughed 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was something else.
Someone said, "Blancaneu and the Seven Dwarfs."
As he arrived late to the campaign, he was lagging behind with fundraising, so he promised he would not access the race if he did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give $250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system over the difficulty of raising money and to target voters, rather than delegates, and rage, and sexism) that she became speechless.
“You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the reaction of the press.
“You could have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my grave?
"Did he cry?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
Initial salvos from the U.S.-China trade war were deafening and, although the war does not appear to be over soon, a distancing of the countries may prove beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed taxes on China’s major exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth $200,000 billion. These tariffs involve a tax levy on half of all goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Beijing has counterattacked each time in the same way and recently raised tariffs from five to ten percent to $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to replicate the U.S. and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to back down anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down involves yielding to some demands, but bowing publicly to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than witnesses had predicted,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria 'prepared' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
“Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime appreciates any help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or the help of the countries that financed the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European national team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. national team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team once again won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the outflow into the water at 3-16, which yielded the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his series and became one of four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out with a 5&4 by the lowest-skilled player of the European team Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t want to cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a very tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
The team is the most important ... and I’m happy to have been able to help,” said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the relief to fellow golfer John Ram, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him,” Rahm said.
Woods lost his four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup race record.
A statistic for one of the best players ever, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. national team struggled all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pushed the European team.
We fought.
I'll take my hat off for Thomas.
He is a great captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I’m proud to have been their captain.
There's a hat to take off.
They have defeated us.”
