This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown brown on the top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also makes it possible to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, called spines, but nevertheless show other characteristics specific to the feathers – beards and beards – the researchers deduced from this that spine was probably an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists say it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.

Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
When it comes to magnetic inversions, the smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and consists of a large number of small particles.

“They are cooler than the surrounding surface by day and warmer at night.”
“Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the planet’s large caves that maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the earth,” said Glen Cushing, a crew member at the USGS (American Center for Geological Studies) and staff at the University of North Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally an experience of low technicality: voters isolate themselves in a cabin, put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the agents have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations fairly strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had their faces hidden when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The lane where the accident took place was temporarily barred to allow the rescue services to extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by Edinburgh's Sheriff's Court.
She is in custody pending her trial and prosecution, but eyewitness accounts could be compromised as her portrait has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts have found the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they post photos, etc. of suspects.”
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all the prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment will be made until the indictment.
Based on the leak, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents for a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting Park and Heritage Conservation Officer at the NPWS, the four snipers designated for the first killing campaign were duly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly yesterday inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to engage the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of defective iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified him of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called “non-serious.”
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple’s report “really regrettable.”
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Alert Centre said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six of them have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature childbirth in his spare time.
His research has shown that if a hormone is administered, it will accelerate the baby’s lung maturation.
The Xinhua agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight loggers (or “black boxes”) on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as weird as me...or even more...I love her and I’m going to miss her...I hope she rests in a better place.”
A survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election found that the number of opponents of Australia’s transformation into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain, as these were prohibited within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest prime number known to date.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more particularly how Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors “talks and political nonsense.”
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, not on previously used ground radar systems, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transportation is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking lots and relay parks are not available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transport has led to the possibility that the game can be played behind closed doors, without the fans of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the genesis of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following breeding between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-billed immigrant finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be drawn in fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in the pH) present in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean, wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of sewer systems have been found in the houses of Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women met.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call into space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The biggest advantage it has brought us is that we have made transport much easier and faster.
It brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats that eat equally medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including wild pet cats) that eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task assigned to each cat, preventing it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and lions.
Women are usually very close to each other, their families being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump great distances and tow with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the broad roar of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be screams and rumblings.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots hunt down and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, sniffing their path on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealthy.Ocelots hunt their prey by melting in their environment before throwing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes based on plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaurus was the super predator of the time, he feared nothing except the other mosasaurus.
His long jaws were equipped with over 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, and his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been cannibalistic.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not tall against him.
Although the Romans ate food as we know it, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and loir, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to hold banquets together where they rested on their side while they ate their meal.
Ancient Roman meals could not include those foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the god’s home.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary that only priests could access.
Some pyramid towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street; the houses were built of stone.
Since there were no great forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
In Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled from Iceland for murder and found Greenland – and named it – by traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen Benjamin Gates and The Templar Treasure, you might think a treasure card was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776"; the text is located at the bottom of the document, on the back.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of facing it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by an important group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term “civilization” is derived from the Latin word “civilis”, which means civil and is related to the Latin words “civilians”, which means citizen, and “civitas”, which means big city or city-state and which also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it relates.
The city-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and a fair dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – Congress being its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or those on tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and it won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing through there mentioned it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous cereal production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the temple of the sun and the hall of the three windows.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better insight into their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the era of analog films.
It’s still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the digital camera’s photographic sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually, and it is quite confusing, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (a family of APS formats, for example) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that arouses dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was called into question.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His ubiquitous power touched everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church money funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to wonder if this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Britain put in place a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters in order to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic aroused only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction in the face of its limitless submarine war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the war during the First World War, nations wished to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different epochs; every stage of China or every family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable age of divided provinces, the best known of these periods being the Three Kingdoms era that took place for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of Chinese antiquity. Thousands of people died in combat to sit on the throne of the great palace of XI'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the classification of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the framework of this worldly life, and he used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy at all to find, even if we know it exists. When you get into the cave, you're completely isolated.
Above it, you can see nothing but the clear and magnificent sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "necropole of Giza", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Cheops, and many small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The “push” symbol resembles a V and the “pull” symbol resembles a staple or a square whose lower side is missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the raise (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward bow usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bow is louder and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to register your own pencil marks, but do not forget that the printed bow marks are for a musical reason, and that they must be respected in general.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were all terrified.
In a chariot, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenditures of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the superprofits of the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself is conducted in a process that far exceeds cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on inherently rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat personal injury.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would have been preferable to the laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered that of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicentre of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders came back loaded with gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the media, Western modes could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothes.
Subsistence farming is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system, using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of members.
Criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often report their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "savage" or savage. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability suffered from the child.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When raised entirely by non-human species, wild children exhibit behaviors (within their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but rather a way to help learners who are discovering a new lesson such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little trombone man from Microsoft Office is one too.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and is intended to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Placement in foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand the speech due to brain injury are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such interpretive abilities of human behavior may be found in animals such as domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two basins in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” a bit like savanna chimpanzees do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and falling asleep soon after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively quiet wake-up call, so you can regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known to be diuretic), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple and consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the consciousness of awakening created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real clashes, through alternative armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, be they bilateral or bilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and assets, while interfering with your enemy’s ability to move his people and assets.
One of the most notable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by barnacles that were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known term shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the tracks for wagons were simply made of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and pull higher loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The crossings were introduced early enough to keep the runways in place, but it was gradually realized that the runways would be more effective if they were equipped with an iron strip on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (“right man”).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even militate in order to alleviate the suffering that lies ahead.
In many cases, this is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten project signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few streets away to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap sheets still known to exist are the earliest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today think that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs being given that they have wings and can fly.
But there’s a lot about birds that still looks like a dinosaur.
They have scaled and clawed legs, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic medicines or household chemicals.
Check the label for first-aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects very suitable for parasitizing humans.
Reeds, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may very well feel that it is not in their own interest, nor in that of the child, to take care of the upbringing of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, birding, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can go to see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns by car to get to their workplace and meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on passenger cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable coherence and can be represented mathematically approximately.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to fly, their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragon flies and ephemera.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because the Earth doesn’t feel like it’s moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of water of the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
As much as 20% of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed by their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants, the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, they were the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also issued the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys are also found which comprise a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new ways of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb works on the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Kind of like climbing a hill on a heavy cart, dividing the core again, then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable core, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to come up to the surface.
Content theories are focused on researching what makes people feel good or are attracted to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's theory of the two factors.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. One of the extremes of the spectrum is to try to remain the "good boyfriend" (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, conduct disciplinary actions, conduct assessments, entrust responsibilities, and hold others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels he/she has to change everything the group has created so far and do things in his/her own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "Invisible Team" is the management team to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to have the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer’s need.
Before an organization is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, injury, tumors and brain trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly connoted science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research is about machine automation of tasks that require an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as writing, voice and face recognition.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on bringing solutions to the problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been implemented in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Very often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is brought about by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at ancient artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically taking part in an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often try the blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging “forces students to get to know the world around them better.” The need to attract public interest prompts students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs "can allow students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively reacting to online content, they can compare their opinions to those of others and expose their own views on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
You will find further south the Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka area and its surroundings that possess pristine natural beauty.
All these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners consider Canada's quintessential.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the East African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent on its own, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands and this religion spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Cape Town that connects Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which should not seem too valuable.
Women must realize that some cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they consider to be harassment, because it is common for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men’s advances, and don’t be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after having destroyed it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and jewellery of all kinds, but that’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be investigated to understand the state of fighting that persists in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for mountain gorilla tracking treks among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (moto taxi) to get around Goma. The normal price (local) is about 500 Congolese francs for a small ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border of the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, which is divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific fauna.
It is one of the best known amusement parks in South Africa and considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees for the park.
It can be advantageous to get a Wild Card that gives access to some of South Africa’s parks, as well as all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main center of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draw the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the Kowloon waterfront located opposite.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on the northern shore plains.
This is where the British settlers invested, so I think it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of this region's colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only composed of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered with water/slum areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, with around 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a suspension bridge overlooking the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened for circulation in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or picking.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as “the giant province of India”, was born from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous populations.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and games are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Polo Argentina Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to one British Pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is a currency commonly accepted throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On neighboring islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and U.S. currencies may be. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands money outside of the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel as if it’s colder than the thermometer says.
There aren’t really “rainy” and “dry” seasons: rainfall is pretty much constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the authorities of the park, it is necessary to stand at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, the buffalo, impetus, moose, bear and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, know that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme Leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated at a peaceful rally in the city, during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour District) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow you to swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast.
The main local beer is the “Number One”, a fairly ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, the “Manta”.
There are plenty of French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink the water from the local tap safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any fears about it.
For Australians, the idea of a “coffee cream” is foreign. A short black is an “espresso”, the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips on the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, canned jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries, and can sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans; most of them are afraid of humans and would stray from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is found in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agencies typically offer packages including breakfast, airport shuttle service or even flight and accommodation packages.
They may also retain the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other necessary documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp out on site, and most consider this an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the music event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed campsite.
Keep in mind that even though the musical shows are finished on the main stages, other musical shows can continue late into the night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noise from the most exposed huts.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers, and windows and clocks are rarely found, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the good mood of the guests and keep them on site.
On some sites, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone traveling by car to high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, it can fall in a very short time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or powder or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most significant moment for many visitors.
In everyday language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African land, and in particular in the savannah, with the aim of attending the gripping spectacle of wild animals in their midst.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and the standard equipment makes it possible to observe them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called “bush walking”, “walking safari” or “ jogging”) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be borrowed, even if there are none in the rooms.
If you don’t have an iron or don’t feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you find one.
Avoid letting the fabric overheat (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil the water for one minute; in others, it is necessary to do it for several minutes.
Filter efficiency varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they don’t know about in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people, are generally not considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops provide an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The stretch between Marion Point and Fairmont has the toughest driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated inland terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict adherence is even higher than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than in many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are baked and baked all year round, while cherries and plums point their noses in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a tight cup of coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the Berliner balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be “solid” or “liquid,” depending on how much sauce it contains.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifier, it tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors that Javanese favor being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: in fact, the user's feet can get stuck there.
If a rider is projected from a horse, but has a foot caught in the caliper, it could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth and rather narrow heel and sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English, have safety bars that allow a throttle to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – The top climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large walls and different granite cliffs.
From the tops of the mountains, the panoramas on the mountains are breathtaking. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new walkable paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are endless.
Winter downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums", who organize their entire holiday depending on the ski in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings showing skiers date back to some of 5,000 BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first leisure ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to alpine skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel distances a little greater than walking – but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on paved slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, so under conventional circumstances, travelling through several countries means having to make several visa applications and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat as a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the area, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured item is an antique; some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on where you are; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than that in Europe.
Craft products can be considered antiques, even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer farming is an important means of subsistence for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance for many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, they lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as trait animals.
Nowadays, many Sami practice modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romans, the term “Gitan” is often considered to be derogatory because of its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country you are traveling to is subject to a travel warning issued by your government, your health insurance abroad or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations that are different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that could cause damage, serious social upheaval or loss of life.
Very unfavorable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of many kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Heavy winds, hail, excessive rainfall and fires are forms and effects of heavy weather, as are storms, tornadoes, sea thunderstorms and cyclones.
Extreme weather phenomena, regional and seasonal, include cold storms, snowstorms with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to inquire about the risks of bad weather that may affect their region of destination, knowing that this may affect the routes they are considering.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An internet search for “Course in a Hostile Environment” will likely provide the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues addressed here in a much more detailed way, usually with practical experience.
A training normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapon handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning a gender change operation abroad must ensure that they have in their possession documents that are valid for their return journey.
Governments' willingness to issue unspecified gender passports (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally variable.
Excavations at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people in the preoperative phase should not expect to pass the scans while preserving their privacy and dignity.
The rip currents are the currents that come back from waves that break on the beach, often on a pit or equivalent.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid stream to the deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion that results from an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, the return to swimming is not more difficult than usual.
Try to target a place where you will not be caught again. It is also possible that depending on your skills and whether or not you have been spotted, you may want to wait for help.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have struggled to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it hard to readjust to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Usually we always hear the noise of tourists and sellers. The story of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long history.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula, and King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and Deception, where the caldera flooded with a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountain Range, which is 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel chain, has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Mountains, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote areas, without a cellular network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those planning a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them are choosing this opportunity.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before college, without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken sabbatical year courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your country.
As a rule, enrolment fees are required to attend these educational programs.
Finland is a prime destination for recreational sailing, and the “Land of a Thousand Lakes” is home to thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Recreational sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but other than that, this is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while coming back to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore with cruise tours, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located at all near the seaside and no tour of this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
One should not be ashamed of it: it is no different from the personal fears and fears that many people experience in relation to other things.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Transport companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, in the context of urgent repairs, the issue of deadlines is crucial for documents, goods or related spare parts.
On some roads, big companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to get it to you faster was to send it as checked-in baggage. Air regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to pay a large amount of money for this privilege (or, better yet, ask your business to do it for you).
However, this is not inexpensive: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
In general, there is no need to seek discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that they can rely on a certain type of traveller who is willing to pay very dearly for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares knowingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any member country of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent connecting platform.
What used to be the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed and lively shopping center, set around a huge bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that reminds more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

As you head north, don’t miss the beautiful shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a place known worldwide for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many living women and men who survived their stay here, and many others who have seen their relatives murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.

The steep exteriors of the Parisians evaporate quickly if you show a minimum of courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and large tetra can be seen there, as well as many other common species.

Men should also wear trousers covering their knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is a great way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said to facilitate reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know if a verb or an adjective is used in a substantiveized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written

However, those who speak a little Spanish might conclude hastily that Portuguese is close enough so that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their time was not as worrying as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first festivals of cherry blossoms were organized by the emperor only for himself and the other members of the nearby aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants have their best appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even “one”.
If you visit a strictly designed garden, the collection of “specimens” will also cause you to be expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered to be an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you get there.
But, located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to take is going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba.

It is a tradition to spend the night of Easter awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evenings during the Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking into the feast at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on these islands originally did so by water, swimming or floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance that separates them from the mainland, the mammals were not able to go to the end of the journey, making the giant turtle the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to admire the northern lights, as the sky will be dark virtually all day.
Because the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than the one Westerners can get used to.
Costumes are classic work outfits, and employees are called by name or function.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get the approval of their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without asking questions.
