This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur plumage does not have the basic structure, the so-called spine, but instead has other typical features of feathers, beards and beards, the researchers concluded that the spine is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. Researchers speculate that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult plumage and not the chick duvet.
According to the researchers, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult feather and not that of a chick.

Brightness is used together with rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is linked to the flow of plasma.
The lower the number of Rossbys, the lower the activity of the star compared to magnetic reversals.

The activity performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys performed by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction force on Earth that generates tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists have been able to assume that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that “normal” matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement released in an interview, this new variant was “highly worrying and alarming, due to the high mortality rate.”
According to Dr. Moll some patients may have contracted the microbe inside the hospital, and at least two of them were health care workers from the hospital itself.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

The infrared images show thermal oscillations between day and night, demonstrating that they are probably caves.
By day they are colder than the surrounding surface and by night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the team of astrogeologists at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: “Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground.”
In France, voting is traditionally an untechnological experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet indicating the chosen candidate.
After verification of his identity by officials, the elector deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
French electoral law codifies the procedures in a very strict way.
Since 1988 the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that at the beginning of the vote there are no envelopes and that there are no envelopes other than those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send their representatives to assist at every stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers perform the vote count under strict control, in accordance with specific procedures.

In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo took part in two single races of the Championships.
The first in the slalom, where on the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 out of 116 competitors in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, saw her ranked tenth in the women's group in the "sitting" category, with a combined travel time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first classified, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower than the ninth place of the Hungarian Danöng Gy
Four female skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to retrieve the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman, and we have also found her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
However, the driver was severely injured in the head.
The road in which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of killing her own son.
She is being held for trial and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish courts have other parameters. The Scottish courts have found the publication of the photos to be potentially harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, “journalists who post photos or other suspicious subjects walk on mined land.”
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for legal proceedings, has told reporters that no new comments will be released until at least the formal indictment.
According to what has been leaked, the subject of the document will be the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to reports, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence for only five years.
Shooters within the experimental program for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of NPWS's Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters chosen for the first firing operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
It is Martelly’s fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread protests, which began in October, that challenge the regime.
The occasional violent protests were triggered by the failure to conduct the elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 overheating-related incidents, which the company called “not serious.”
In its response, the ministry called Apple’s postponement of the report “absolutely deplorable.”
The earthquake at Marianne was reported at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported to the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Philippine policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued, at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins retraced his father’s footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
After training in obstetrics, in 1959 she went to work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, in his spare time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" with flight records.
His fellow wrestlers also wanted to pay homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, exactly like her. A strong woman."
“Moon was weird like me... Maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... Hopefully she’s in a better place,” said Dustin “Goldust” Runnels.
According to the survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia’s move to the republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Elizabeth II.
This view is shared by 34% of respondents, according to whom Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Contrary to the survey, 29% of respondents say Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but he has accused several disorders that have led to doubts about his physical fitness.
He could not take the necessary medications to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, which is the material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and in particular how the Earth formed, having clashed with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing more than “joke and political idiocy.”
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system employs satellite technology rather than obsolete ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation is being arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while on-site car parking or interchange parking is not available.
Fears about the absence of means of transport have led to the possibility of having the game played behind closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of birds was born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time required for this process was much longer; this was due to the coupling between a Darwin-endemic fin, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus fin, Geospiza coniros.
Gold can be processed in any kind of shape. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to form a thin wire, suitable for twisting and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "mined codes" thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the juice of red cabbage it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical analyzed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
By hydrogen ions are meant protons to which the electrons have been torn away (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, put them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on their hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will provoke a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bath with running water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewerage system.
In Greece, the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini have been discovered remnants of sewage networks.
Cabinets in antiquity also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes placed in public baths, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and vision in part.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space, you need a rocket that is more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is to have provided us with easier and faster transports.
Thanks to his invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-range domestic cats) that feed on small, noticeably more numerous prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and that allows him not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called herds.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion herd acts very similar to the herd of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not that of other large cats), even with regard to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (though not very well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a tensile force five times that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) of the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it more resembles a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Octopuses love to feed on small animals. If possible, they go hunting for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find the animals to eat (prey) thanks to the smell, sniffing on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots camouflage themselves with the surrounding environment and then plumb them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making it difficult for it to return), it will probably find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so to pose as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than previously required.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb carbon dioxide expelled by them (through exhalation).
Plants process their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shadows.
We build our homes from plants and produce clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants the animals would not be able to survive.
The mosasaurus was the super-predator of his era and for this he feared nothing but the other mosasaurus.
From his long jaws sprang more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed his path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that he had forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also provided for several strange or unusual courses, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a species of rodent called garlic.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate while sitting in the chairs, rich men loved to feast together while lying on their side while eating their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurat, were built that became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Due to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family’s life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the backyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red was the one to name it, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Despite being all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you’ve seen the movie “The Templar Mystery,” you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
Even if there's something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears reversed at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is well known that at the beginning of its existence the large document of parchment (measure 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only affixed as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had brought northern France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and allied themselves with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, which became known as Operation Dragoon.
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading for Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city-state, and in a certain way also defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural footprint through a fair spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, not being so recognized as actual civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, and the Congress was the only component, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on state authorities, often uncollaborative, for the enforcement of their acts.
It did not even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
In order to amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was necessary, and these had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with Germany, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, waterball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Nearly 7,000 islands are part of the Japanese (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who were passing by soon registered the name of the island with the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation involving Aboriginal grain production systems and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the era of analog photography.
It still occurs today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Oddly, the height of the 35 mm size is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the APS format family) are the same or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often derided rule of third parties is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
Its ubiquitous power has affected everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the fundamentals of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary reserves of the church exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective: it provided for the cessation of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law usually welcomed and codified by multiple international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, also putting neutral ships at risk.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and horrors of World War I, the nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted an offer of employment at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdom period, between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these periods, among many nobles fighting for the throne, fierce wars arose.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to gain a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an Palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, among them the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since army rankings, instead of being class-based, now rely on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers itself a very clear picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if one knew its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has come to our day not in ruins.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, houses numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, various temples and the Great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Pharaoh’s wives and family members.
The "arc up" sign resembles a V and the "arc down" sign resembles a staple or a square with no lower side.
Up means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start from the amaranth (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards itself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while a descending arc results in a louder and more decisive sound.
You may decide to add your custom pencil directions, but keep in mind that the arching signs you find printed have a musical significance, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, together with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young sons (Maria Teresa of 11 years and Louis Charles of 4 years) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly the enormous gains from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits at the base of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the Early Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which ended by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the strict sense that the destiny of man is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves a development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time customs, customs and culture have arisen related to such geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, have resulted more effective than the laws imposed in an arbitrary manner.
Similarly in Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as a hub of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its prestige declined, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of capital of fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slowness of the communication channels means that the spread of styles in the West can delay by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic, system that uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of crops.
Historically most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often the members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, through negligence, as a result of misfortune, or as a result of intentional abuse, grew up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or savage. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or flight.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully reared by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that cared for him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, much more a help for those undertaking a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of scaffolding, but so is the small, staple-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, solicit and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are given custody for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide them with nourishment, care and training, but happens to them.
We believe that the shelter is a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
The shelter is supposed to meet all the unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
Characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification theory.
For example, important motivations for using the Internet are "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships."
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domesticated dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, i.e., hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savannah.
In addition, failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: growth slowdown, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors have solved their “protein problem” in a way like savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the period of normal sleep, followed by a resumption of sleep (10 to 60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness, without waking up completely.
If you decide to reset the watch in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options include consuming plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace proportionally opposite to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is only hampered by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the focus of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic conflicts, procedural and cultural, caused the rupture between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies; thus the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken down; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans proved to be obsolete, however, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to ensure that the country safeguards its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time counteracting the enemies’ ability to move their people and goods.
One of the recent examples supporting this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, Iran.
They began to be bred from the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have milk, fleece, meat and skin readily available.
Domestic goats were usually bred in herds left free to move on the hills or in other grazing areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of herding are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, wagons were built in England.
Although they were simply made of parallel wooden boards, the wagons, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses that traveled along them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossbars were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to those made of iron. In 1767 the first rails made their appearance completely of iron.
The first means of transport that man knew was legs. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If instead we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and deactivate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap’s printing press a few blocks away.
In the night they were produced between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "The Dunlap Posters".
The document was first publicly read on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on 9 July, while a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 known Dunlap embroideries are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that make them common to dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all currently used computers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in computer engineering language these numbers are called binary or bit digits.
The internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so much so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check if there are first aid instructions on the label for that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both killer bed bugs and bed bugs are nested, that is, adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States, multiple sclerosis (MS) has about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double that of males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or that of their child.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In one adoption, natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But it’s not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations helps guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
Mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting the natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visits to parks and the study of information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small country villages to drive to work, crossing other people whose workplace is where they just left.
In this dynamic direction, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its conditions of stability that has enabled human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transportation systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into ruin.
Why are transportation systems attracting so many complaints, why are they being rejected every day? Are the engineers designing them that are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex since the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable consistency and can be represented generically mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small swamps to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemera.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For some, he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and the other stars as well), moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, because we don’t have the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on Earth, carrying 8 times the amount of water of the second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that at some points reaches six miles.
The total 20% of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, with thousands of smaller tributaries flowing into it.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of the size and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were enchanting to admire the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the daily language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious services.
In the Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and can be extracted quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These actually resemble more the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could enter the point at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil has therefore proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never has the need to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something new comes along.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the fission bomb’s operation.
In practice it is like rolling a heavy cart on a hill, so by further dividing the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
Marias could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the rise of lava on the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what pleases or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and push them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslow’s Need Hierarchy Theory and Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start directing their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Managers of this type find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager transforms into a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the whole work of the team and do it himself.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place depending on the various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the management team that each member refers to and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the will to deal with the long process leading to building a learning organization? A good reason to implement organizational learning concepts can be innovation.
When all the resources available in all functional departments of an organization are used effectively, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
For an organization to be innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The area of research becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists’ research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and cancer can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously unobserved brain structures and processes.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation of machines.
AI research includes building machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of applications include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as writing, voice and face recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is often used today in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see artifacts from museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by poor grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author undertakes to improve writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them". The need to fuel the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming and bilingual capital, full of art galleries and museums that tell the country’s past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoilt beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The larger areas to the north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wilderness.
If you compare the population, the result can be surprising to many: in the United States the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Nearly all of the smaller islands, known as luxury resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travellers: it is recommended that everyone declares that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider a nuisance, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city that was called Daru l-Badya, later named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who chose these places for their trading bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and lots of hardware, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to document well before making any visits outside of Goma, so as to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the cheapest opportunities to see Africa’s mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motorcycle) to get around in Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the special by Henry Louis Gates of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its more arabic than African touch, the city stands out from the others in the country.
Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) lies northeast of South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, north bordering Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides sustenance to a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily contributions for conservation and entrance to the park.
Buying a Wild Card may also be helpful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is for many tourists the main destination.
The series of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart, even more evident because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront in front.
Most of Hong Kong's urban development has focused on the densely populated reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the place that English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you’re looking for testimonies of this land’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove coastal strip in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland to Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps; there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; in the area it is estimated that there are 400 royal tigers from Bengal and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those headed east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby resorts, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a narrow bridge connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two trusses have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes wide 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic only took place in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully functional.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were Seminomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its indigenous identity and peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las Cañitas, the most important tournament of the year is held.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands have their official currency, the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), whose value equals that of the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars as well.
It is likely that on the peripheral islands they will not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies can be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a lower temperature than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no “dry” and “rainy” seasons defined: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of humans, the fauna is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not maintaining an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals adequate space as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there was the infamous naval stalemate of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
In the course of the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamaasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mostly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
These are beaches suitable for families sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can bathe safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines, but those from Australia and New Zealand could cope better with the trip.
Local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, 'flat white' coffee comes from a foreign idea. 'Espresso' is black short coffee, cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on the same level as Belgian. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the coral reef and injuries to one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow directions and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to keep themselves at a distance.
The saltwater crocodile habitat consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not actively living in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even flight+hotel combination packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to provide you with additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
On occasion of some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and gain a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is done on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa waiver (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase the time and money spent by their guests as much as possible. Typically, there are neither windows nor watches, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests’ moods up and make them hold back.
In some venues, alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, drunkenness alters judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or near-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and you can’t drive like when you’re on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in no time can fall so much snow that you get stuck.
Precipitation and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the windows of the vehicle, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa’s biggest tourist attraction and the focus of many visitors’ vacations.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to journeys by land, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so regular equipment is enough to get a good look.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful, so you can observe them better with your binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking" safari) is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, the first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary from one another, however most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for the events will be between 2,500 and 130,000 pounds, while regular tickets will cost about 7,000 pounds.
Ironing wet clothes can facilitate drying. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try with a hairdryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to put the tissues under too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are several ways to heal water and some of these are found to be more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of water packaged inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Parasites can damage food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infection.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty-free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax-free and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travellers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that presents the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas among the vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is recommended to keep your eyes wide open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits exposed are much lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (typically 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile phone service is much higher than that present in other parts of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit cakes are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
Those who want to taste small but rich sweets can orient themselves on those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can appear both "dry" and "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan for curry in the inland regions is normally used yogurt; in southern India and in some other coastal region of the subcontinent is more used coconut milk.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally indicates foods originating from the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are support for the rider's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present safety problems for the possibility that the rider's feet remain stuck.
If a jockey is overtaken by a horse but has a foot embedded in the bracket, it may be dragged by the escaping horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Later some saddles, especially the English ones, have installed safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where there are a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Scalers from all over the world continuously trace new paths on its walls, potentially endless.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and provide snowboarding thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts multiple enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums", who dedicate entire periods of vacation to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Ski hiking: the activity is also called off-piste, mountaineering skiing or ski trekking.
It is connected, although it usually does not understand them, to ski touring or skiing, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require skis and boots much more rigid.
Think of the ski slope as a similar route to the hiking one.
If the conditions are good, you can cover distances somewhat greater than those traveled by walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but consists of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries you would have to apply for a visa and go through passport check several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from border to border without having to go through passport checks again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique piece. Some tax agencies consider such an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition differs geographically from the age limit that may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft objects could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar mass-produced objects.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade rests is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding; some lived by fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as working animals.
Today many Sámi carry out modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word “Zingaro” is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a traveler’s warning is issued for the destination you will visit, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or your insurance in the event of a trip cancellation.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are simply a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, severe social distress or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong wind gusts, hail, rainfall above normal and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, marine trumpets and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal high-intensity weather phenomena include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone who plans to visit a country potentially considerable as a war zone, must support vocational training.
Searching on the Internet for 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are widespread, while few publications deal with war zones.
Travellers planning to have sex-changing surgery abroad should make sure they have the documents valid for the return trip with them.
The intention on the part of governments to issue passports without indications regarding sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Security inspections also became much more scrupulous in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass checks without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rice currents consist of the return flow of waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which may prove impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, going back to swimming won’t be harder than normal.
Try to find an area where you don’t risk being trapped again, or consider waiting for help, based on your skills and if you’ve been spotted.
The return shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being a smaller "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the uses of your home culture.
In the first experience abroad, you are likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were necessary even for those who returned to their homeland.
The show of sounds and lights of the pyramid is the most interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, you will be able to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with spring water to a magnificent natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km long chain cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, because to call you have to be outdoors with the visual clear up to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure craft, including pleasure craft, as well as missions that need data and voice remotely.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly prevalent among recent graduates, since they can take a year before starting college without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a course abroad during the sabbatical year can actually increase your chances of resuming higher education upon return to your home country.
Usually enrolling in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands, inside the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is the national pastime of Finland, where one boat is counted for every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Many of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For the descent to the ground you will not need a separate visa (from 2009) using the excursions on board.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, also the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can scare people of all ages and of any condition, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar to the personal fears and aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding a little about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on what is unknown, or not being in control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would have required days for unloading and customs.
The only way to make it arrive faster would be to ship it as checked baggage. And this is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or business class the most obvious way is to pay a good fee for the privilege (or, better yet, to convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for business trips and up to eleven times the fare for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and accordingly apply certain fares.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that in the past has been the scene of ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian-Orthodox religion.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient city of Izmir is located on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and is currently a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although the city breathes an atmosphere more like that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers are dotted with characteristic red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the church hall, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily accessible. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendor written by Lord Byron.
The bus line Scotturb 403 regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), place of famous Marian apparitions all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who have survived these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or made them work to death, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid misrepresenting these places by smearing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most of the signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
Underground, regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unplanned service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians are reputed to be self-centered, rude, and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel good in Paris continues to be to behave at your best, relating as a "bien hauté" (well-educated) person. This will definitely facilitate your travels.
The harsh exterior appearance of Parisians will fade quickly if you show off some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly beech, peaches and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, it presents a wide variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the cedar rooster, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for unprepared women, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants even under the knees.
Even these can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each wearer, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "You", always start with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a noun form makes writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are the c and g, since their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: expensive means beloved, while carriage means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and sentence comprehension.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language may come to the precipitous conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Nowadays, premodern observatories are obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden age was not a problem as it is today, they are usually placed in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes intended for research are huge structures in remote areas where weather conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoming was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossoming parties were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy near the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to even take "only" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you to get away from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to go around; you can buy just about anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional place where the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the inside of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the paths of hiking trails and well-known bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important feasts of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Much of the traditions related to this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition is to spend the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place to be able to admire the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations behind this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional Churches, an Easter Vigil is frequently celebrated on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the midnight commotion ceremony to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands would arrive there by swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the mainland was considerable, mammals could not cope with the journey, which caused the giant tortoise to become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos.
If you visit the territories of the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, it will be possible to experience the polar night, when the sun stays under the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility of witnessing the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than the one Westerners tend to get used to.
Office clothing normally consists of jacket and tie or tailor and is addressed to colleagues with the surname or with the professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it attaches importance to the group’s commitment rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive approval from their superiors about every decision, and are expected to stick to the instructions without asking questions.
