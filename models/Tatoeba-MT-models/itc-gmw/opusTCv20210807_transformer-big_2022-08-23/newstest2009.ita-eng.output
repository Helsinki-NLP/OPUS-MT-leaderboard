The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange restored losses.
The transactions of CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has resumed from the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downturn is the stock crash on Wall Street.
Thus, even from us, there is a reaction from the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan of stabilization of the local financial sector.
Decline of stocks in Asia
Asian stocks fell dramatically on Tuesday, although the indexes later cleared some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng Index during the day wiped out nearly 4%, but later also some of the losses stabilized at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange were down more than 5 percent, but in the end the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Thay-Wan stock market, according to the local index, fell 3.6%.
“The planning of rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world,” said Hong Kong’s head of currency Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy on its own, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposed financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will also suffer consequences.
The Slaughter of American Stocks
The U.S. Parliament on Monday rejected the financial system’s support plan, for which $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion Czech crowns) had to be allocated.
Lawmakers have ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a mass shooting and major stock indices recorded the biggest crash in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a collapse of similar size was last observed in 1987.
The index was lowering already before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not passed, it went into free fall.
Congress has given in: the U.S. government can give 700 billion dollars to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an understanding of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have broken the ice in the dialogue on approving the bailout plan in the form of economic aid to the U.S. financial system for a total of $700 million (nearly 12 trillion kronor).
But it is not yet said.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, he told Reuters, the chairman of the Barney Frank House Banking and Financial Services Committee.
In the Senate, according to some sources, one could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
Later, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, the help of the markets will be obtained.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a big step forward.”
"We have clarified our differing views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package," Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
The final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers' delegates met Saturday night with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to finalize the government's funding.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which put financial companies at serious losses and put the stability of the entire system at risk.
“We are in the process of completing the definitive agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.”
“It’s necessary to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on stock markets that are collapsing sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
That is, they want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence Monday’s market following the congressional decision.
But for now it’s not definitively clear when the two Houses of Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last minute on some issue.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount of the system support shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be made available as soon as possible as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the allocation of the remainder of the sum in case it gets the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the finals 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may override his veto right.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, that is, to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage securities, whose price has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not able to pay their mortgages.
"We've worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” as the Republican senator mentioned.
US President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s positive performance and appreciated “the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief spokesman, said lawmakers agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the budget of reductions, splitting the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called gold parachutes for the executives of the companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard and made a big step towards the deal that will work and be useful for the market and also for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan relies on helping homeowners who have payment problems.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage installments it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly spending on installments for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance’s principal economist, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will determine how the losses will be shared between the financial sector and the government,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
“Most importantly, this week the representatives of the Congress will reach an agreement on the support of this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this most important time,” Marek said.
Last Blood Duel: MP3 Players vs Cell Phones
We will advise how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
This makes it clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
However, there are many reasons to get a self-published reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy yourself an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
First of all these music products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view there is not even an objective reason.
But if your shelves are crowded with hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls, you’ll probably dream of a turntable like that.
It also works with portable music, i.e. music compressed or simply in MP3 format.
Here too there are the price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for a reader 8,000 crowns, just as a fan of Pink Floyd may hardly digest the headphones from twenty crowns in the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It is the life of the batteries that decides.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read music, but mobile phones don’t do it by mistake.
There is no other device as universal as the mobile phone.
Next to the primary functions, phone and text, it can read music and videos, record both and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe can even browse.
And if we take smartphones and handhelds into account, you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a little miracle because no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the phone and the earlier the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
Reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap mobile phones, don’t count that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls , get to work for safety another charger, this also applies for the most expensive devices.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours at continuous functionality with one charge.
There is another problem when you download music to your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory players are able to do it without an adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, with some exceptions (iPods) do not need any special software.
Simply fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players create a media library on their own, sorted by the names of the performers, album name, genre, or user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device you are particularly interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly ease of use.
If the music is mainly for you as a background and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram you just have a cell phone that plays MP3.
That’s right now, of course, on any cell phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about which formats the phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in just this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular, the majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by the company Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument for buying a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is poor and is usually limited to hits of the moment of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phones behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to something squints in their pocket while the MP3 player stays forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest benefit of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kronor.
For 3,000 and 4,000 crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones and also with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15,000 kronor.
But the advantage of readers is, besides others, easy handling.
The simplest ones aren’t necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) and anyone can really handle them.
The minimum of the functions, the similarity of the maneuverability once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally impacting the start of the mobile internet network and consequently of a giant bill for the transmission of data.
What device to take
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (such as M2, microSD, etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, you fall into the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and also want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, preferably take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service thus comes close to the same MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson has done more in this area, which have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (usually 15 hours, generally up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Maybe.
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all the services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, there is something missing – a virtual trader that forces the traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be missing for long.
Of the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end, it was also confirmed by T, who pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in us than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps by the European Commission in the field of regularising roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible for prices in the Czech Republic to remain so high vis-à-vis Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that would really like to start the confrontation.
Perhaps it sounds absurd, also here we have three mobile networks and coverage significantly above 100%.
Instead, mobile phone operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The head of the Czech Telecommunication Council, Pavel Dvosak, has often stressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network no longer has many possibilities. (Moreover it may be difficult to find other frequencies by now).
But there is another possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which the traditional operators should have reacted.
At the same time before the entry of sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, similar rumors resounded in Britain as we do.
However, it has been proven that the place for such operators is there and that they can be really successful.
At the end of the day, we don’t have to go very far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator has managed to win over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, to which in the Czech Republic among other things U:fon belongs.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to work effectively, it takes a lot less customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry behind, that is, relatively high expenses for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually come at a low cost, offer calls and SMS at a low price, which is often in balance with the offer of the narrowest services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that cost at least half as much as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, even betting on a target group can be a pretty good move.
This operator focuses, so to speak, specifically on men.
“Real men choose Mobilking operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept can be affirmed by us as in Poland.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav Epick: “The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of services is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever a trader in the Czech Republic it will not be the Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have a lot of expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," Jana Studniková, the press spokesman for the financial group Penta, said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz.
Thus he indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not very supportive of this thought.
Rather, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor is created.
For some time now it has not hidden its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefonika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner it is done the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all the Czech operators of the mobile network.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them,” said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator may have to have it by the end of the year.
But for now around his creation stands an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment we do not believe that there is space in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no one with a complex and serious project has addressed us," Vlastimil Sr?e?e? mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz from the press section of Telefonika O2.
The specificity of the Czech market is also used by other operators.
T-Mobil press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová added in a rare deal with the O2 statement: “For now we have not noticed any commercial projects that are vital and beneficial for both of us, on which we can continue to build.”
He adds: “A virtual operator will hardly appear on the T-Mobil network by the end of the year.
At this point we would have had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon.”
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on achieving its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav ?epick? adds: “We are open to the negotiation of potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most productive.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Competent authorities -with accomplices
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
So why facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around the creation of U:fon testify that when operators care about something they can row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was pressing against T in the period of the creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to the information of public access from the web pages of T.
But right now U:fon serves as the argument for which to not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: “The competition environment in the mobile market has been greatly enhanced with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Regarding the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place on him and especially on his high-demand services.
The attitude of the mobile operators, however, is quite surprising the complete disinterest on the part of the Czech regulators.
It’s not just about the attitude of the “T” that unfortunately in the Czech Republic – unlike Britain and other developed countries – has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
This belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (OHS).
This, however, has taken on its typical position.
The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer from potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators,” Kristián Chalupa of the External Relations section of ?OHS said in a response to our question.
Such a formulated statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
Instead, the office has to defend the interests of consumers and, moreover, take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of its position in the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Overseas where virtual operators commonly work, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile services."
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of OHS.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence arises on its own.
Just as the identical price of petrol for all petrol stations is the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
“The section found no signs of anti-competitive behavior about this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No trader has a dominant position, so it has no corresponding greater responsibility for its behavior in the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be lacking to the telecommunications regulator,” Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is the relevant market analysis developed by T, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech trader has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator it is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has – after all, logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we don’t admit this argument, for OHS it should be a minimum warning for three mobile operators to proceed in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all traders they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to you in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which you keep OHS out of the business.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of the rights of T on the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recent update of the telecommunications law, despite the fact that many experts expected the situation to improve.
This fact the representatives of OHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
It can be done when no one is watching.
But without us noticing it, the functioning of these pseudo-virtual operators remains, of which there are even some in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own prices for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually the companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the pre-established people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company against the operator appears as a classic corporate customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major customer you then receive special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar presale.
“If the cases you are talking about arise, which we will be interested in, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and it could lead to the conclusion of the cooperation with that company,” Martina Kemrová replied to the question in question.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator at the same time defends itself against such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they derive a not indifferent profit and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav ?epick? warns of possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the regular customers of mobile operators.”
But that should be a little strange to you.
Then there is another question for OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that OHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want to, it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of everything and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a considerable lowering of prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually every country where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - market too small, at the edge too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
In developed countries, however, regulatory bodies have intervened in these cases, not for mobile operators but for their customers.
Both with the formal measurements and with the non-formal pressure, then came the creation of the first virtual operator and he was joined by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators throw themselves from one to the other all the time like a boiling potato.
In our experience, we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not toss the sponge.
If the backstage information is right and the virtual operator will really appear from us soon, the Czech mobile market will get back on its feet.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, only OHS could hardly remain impassive to the rejection (discrimination) of the others concerned.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov maj".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji? B?lohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, choir pitch and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kate?ina Kn?nková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn revisions are Otakar Jeremia and Jaroslav Krsek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B?lohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already before he told the radio "Rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the solo variations, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
“From the beginning I tried to make sure that both of them, and also the choir, have a clear saying, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony,” he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov ma'j" was first performed on the stage of the Stavovskéh in 1834 in Josef Kajetán Tyl's original Fidlova'ka accompanied by Franti'ek's music.
He gained popularity and people spontaneously made him their own.
The first stanza of the song after the foundation of the Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound
On Wednesday MHD in Prague you will also be accompanied for the first time by an electronic card
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the Prague Transport Company will be written in the history of Prague as the date when the first passengers to have an electronic card in their pocket will board the metro, tram and bus.
At the moment, it can be procured by about one hundred thousand people who own their own OpenCard.
Passengers can buy the annual 30-day and 90-day ticket (which will run from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their card charged at Infopoints and Transport Company offices and at the Muzeum, M?stek, Nádra? Hole?ovice, And?l, Rozty?, Let?any, Kobylise?????????????????????????
Coupons can already be purchased yesterday on the Internet at the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the internet service can completely forget about the doors in the metro stops where until now they had to make long lines for paper tickets.
The coupon can be purchased online and is reloaded on the Opencard on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a trained desk that will help those interested in purchasing on the internet and will also record the credit acquired on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opartrn.
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to upload the electronic coupons on the OpenCards in ATMs and self-service that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they resemble the ticket destroyers and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stops Roztyly, Budzjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are now five in the entire city but by the end of the year there should be eighty,” Opartrno said.
The coupon will be checked instead by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just enter the Opencard card and upon payment of the coupon, it will load on it.
Electronic tiles are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from the number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
“In the trains added to Prague’s integrated transports there are the controllers equipped with card readers with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity,” explained the mode of checking Filip tickets by the organization Ropid, which sets the schedules of the public transports in Prague.
The city buses have card readers integrated in the driver’s box.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to rest the Opencard at the determined point next to the case.
So the driver checks the validity of the loaded coupons.
“If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information,” Drápal added.
Passengers who take city buses and do not remember when the coupon expires, can again go to the self-service ATMs, where they load the coupons on the card.
Here you will see the information on the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the United States.
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include Umava in the United States.
This is the result of the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, it is said, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This is more than anything else from the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
In the letter to the American president, the Germans of ?esk? Krumlov ask not to allow the return of the "?umava district" - occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia again.
“We understand the situation and want to be sure of the promises that American units will reach German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads.
Because, they say, the annexation of Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives Sudeten Germans only hope for brutality, lack of respect, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter plead with the American president to take over the protectorate over Umava now and forever.
“We cannot believe that regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would recognize this territory as a state that is foreign to us, that oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has not contributed at all, at all, to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors can’t sign it is the alleged fear of the “Czech oppressors’ thirst for revenge.”
If the president of the United States were to doubt the belief of the Germans in Umava, it would be enough to organize in the district a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or live under the mastery of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive to our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least intuit that it would be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate a sort of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in Cheské Budajovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German from Budajovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in prison camp at Holitan, dozens of other Czech Germans went to him for him to teach him Czech.
“They thought that once they got home the Czech would make them comfortable,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia as a result of the war, according to him relied on the fact that on the basis of Bene's decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
You're not gonna pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers.
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, one could call the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport plans to launch on Wednesday.
The office of the Minister Alești ?ebí?ek, expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The 150-million-dollar campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put on the belt before leaving.
He wants to touch in his conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and last but not least professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially stories of people that will affect emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You're not gonna pay!
The word "do not think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with their life.
Advertisements will scare viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"With drivers the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they switch to red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or the accident.
You have to remember the risk to the drivers," says transport ministry psychologist Martin Kocán of Na Homolce Hospital.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If you have installed the fixed panel that warns of the danger, it will probably soon become confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Kozán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has spoken out for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will have to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all of them," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but we will have to leave the same percentage to the Palestinians because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that the eventual restitution will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want rupees or planners to pass over him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the reference to the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are within the Old City.
“He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he said.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was a prerequisite for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from Golan,” he said.
“The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shia movement); they will have to give up their permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism, Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq.”
Questions after the accident: Are stewards illegal on buses?
The law does not recognize them, you can not walk on the bus that makes long distances
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus company Student Agency came the question of whether stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
“If we want to strictly and formally abide by the laws, the steward’s activity is in conflict with road traffic law,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident last week that killed a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut off the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the bus at the time, despite the fact that there were still two other seats allocated.
But the bus can make an accident or slow down abruptly even when distributing coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the traffic booklet.
If not approved, passengers should be seated.
The buses of the Student Agency have no standing places, confirmed to the site Aktuáln.cz the director of the company Radim Jan?ura.
“We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After that it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the seat assigned,” he said.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role.”
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The road traffic law recognizes only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," Hanzelka added less clearly.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn? believes, however, that the law takes care of this problem quite enough.
It depends on whether the bus has the approved standing seats.
That's all," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are standing seats and maximum limited speed, interurban with standing seats with highest maximum speed and long distance without standing seats with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Just like on a plane, says the expert.
The road safety expert Jaroslav Hocín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on airplanes.
Even there it isn’t safe when turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can bang his head.”
“If the bus brakes hard, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Same as on the city bus or tram.
The transport company has to solve the safety of the stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Janzura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company offering steward services.
It takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director considered their job dangerous.
“As soon as I have the feeling that I have to consider the profession of steward as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they board.
It would also reduce expenses,” he says.
Asiana director Alexej Litvin, who runs a fraction of the lines with respect to Student Agency, explained the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
“We don’t have a hostess, we oppose her from the beginning.
Sooner or later he will end up with a fatal accident," said less than a year ago T?den.cz.
A huge tragedy has happened.
In the accident of the line to Naples, a young hostess from the region of Plzeți died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sharp maneuver, but hit it with the right front.
Janura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewarts had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these places on long-distance buses, they are inaccessible."
The company intends to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in view
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarifying the movement of stewarts on board buses.
“But they have not achieved any concrete results.
Buses don’t consider them that much, they take care of the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and mobile phone use while driving,” says expert Hosin.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider stewart activity as a major threat to the safety of passengers,” said spokesman Havelka.
Düsseldorf hopes for Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the director of the WestLB addressed to the collaborators of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that it could form "the capital market center of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of units of the Düsseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a “competent block” with lasting profits in such a venture.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive impetus for further ties in the Länder’s banking sector.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the afflicted WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having pointed out long ago to the North Rhine-Westphalia regional government that time is running out in search of a future solution.
Of the links between the Deka-Bank, which the same clients of the Savings Banks already know because of their investment funds, and the WestLB certainly has been talking about it for a long time, also from Frankfurt.
Deka-Bank chief Franz Waas reported in late August when presenting turnover for the first half of the year that a merger of the house at Mainz Street with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
But the Deka board of directors, half of whom are brought by regional banks and savings banks, has delegated the board of directors to hold talks with West LB on joint bargaining.
These could be market trades or parts of them.
The conversations, however, have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important companies in Frankfurt, not the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it seemed that the Deka-Bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
Nothing was done about this threesome.
As soon as the projects were published, the Hessian regional bank was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank instead went to the Baden-Württemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought about a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But eventually Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba's board, spoke out against design games to reunite with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that cognition is created, that it is necessary to approach the different houses of the public sector.
Since the Bavarian Parliament has been elected, a meeting of the Landesbank of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg could take place at first.
For Helaba, this is not good news.
If the pressure for more mergers increases, the partners will be missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the homes in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of Hesse-Thuringia savings banks that participates with 85% of Helaba, put the lock on the meeting with WestLB.
Only the NordLB would remain.
These geo-strategic arguments are only one account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual homes match.
In June, Merl pointed out that the decisive question, by which business model the future of regional banks would be ensured, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end, the division of West LB could also come out, which by that of course is not desired.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
We will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser brand’s 5l barrel stands a massive bearded beard and demonstrates to about 200 travelers the deep tones it manages to produce from the throat.
Elena gives Luca a pat and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here at the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, this evening at 23.45 four couriers depart to Monaco, Festival of Beer" , scheduled arrival at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It’s so noisy, Marco says, that it’s not a thing for Italians.
Frame wearing a long coat with fake fur lining and a pair of glasses with wide silver laces belong to him buses.
For 5 years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
The night drive, daytime to the party, back at 10.30.
Overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome to the Kaiser beer toast, made according to Bavarian standards of authenticity, the health insurance and the German driving – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly silence falls on the bus, travelers sleep.
Better yet, they will still need their strength.
They stop at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco’s group arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others regroup, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiggiando.it".
Second, “When they open the doors of the beer tent, it means running!” quotes Marco early in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Don't go in front of us, or we'll lock up, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, split into the adjacent space!"
The mug costs 8.25 Euros, Marco shouts.
And don't forget to give the tip.
"Demonstrate to the security service that we are doing well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!”
Third, "Tonight at 10:30 p.m. we'll meet here again!
He's already leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as one follows away the yellow hats to trees, to road signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as the “Italian weekend”.
Exact data do not exist, we talk about 50,000, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Munich police force is reinforced with 7 South Tyrolean agents, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic on nationalities, where Italians are in first place with 200 medical care before the British (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word “relative” and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, gets a billionaire loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turmoil.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested party.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the affiliate Depfa.
The state lender, according to a newspaper article, has refinanced in the very short term – which is no longer possible because of lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008 the bank’s reserves were reduced by 95% from 2.37 million Euros, the share of equity also fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs fell to 0 compared to last year, earnings from increases in both claims and certain shares as well as the liquidation of provisions in credits fell by more than 70% on the EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher incomes from repayment of subordinated compensation costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the repayment of interest under the single text of tax laws and the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was fairly moderate with about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 had lost himself in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were split up in the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classic state funding was too low, Depfa has engaged more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they had been reduced by two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is a major financier of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on market refinancing between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have client fiduciary deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has largely dried up because banks accumulate liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually needs a portion of Depfa’s credit portfolio – about 50 billion – for short-term refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate notice, the group's financial needs were covered by credit for a certain period and the company was protected from the influence of the mostly non-functioning international money markets.
From other sources it is felt, that thanks to the money refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
HRE chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said the HRE group will not need money markets in the near future.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE group is still assured.
This is hoped for the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be used fully.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank to what was learned it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the spirits.
The stock price drops by 75% to 3.30 Euros.
They run mortgage courses pretty well.
While front-degree debts are almost immovable, they yield off credit defaults.
Most notably, the loans of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo are affected, understandably, with a maturity beyond 2009.
Once the HRE mortgages seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, which with the emphasis of Depfa has crushed the crisis, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until less-damaged central banks, governments and banks are ready, one can count on an amortization of annuities by the deadline.
Or it goes into operation, which no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But regarding information overturned due to partial statizations the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will mostly create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to split from their commitments.
Short-term investors can conclude the carry-over of losses for future capital gains compensation tax payments.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop, on the first day of school, is due to show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls begin to chuckle: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log she tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I was also excited to go to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road myself and fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been fixed as by us in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive gradually from 8 am until 8.40 am to begin a short interview with the professor, the so-called "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who talks in front of people, in addition to a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn’t have my school uniform yet, I put on an old host mother’s skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I sat in front of the chair and tried to pronounce it well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, sneered and made a mark and I continually heard the word "Kawaii."
I knew this from my mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "sweet, sweet".
Then I ran quickly for my place.
The girl next to me guessed, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson was quietly continued, but when she played the gong, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They were all talking messy and mocking and asking me questions – then it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the pause everyone opened their Benedict.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket- it's different from boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of wrapping with meat and tofu..
I don’t even know what I’m eating in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
Fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except for the plums put under salt, brrrr!
The Bentos aren’t just lunches at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a self-made Benedict, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of then getting to know the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I’m curious if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them, "I would like to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
I have been reading Mangas for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started learning the Japanese language.
I was completely convinced to come once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care a lot about us.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends – on the opposite side: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life.”
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach run away when they feel danger.
The neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could we find out if, when they behave in the same way as we do, they have the same feelings as we do?
Articles by well-known scientists have been published in the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else so far being able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we address other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter impractical territory, because the baseline does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do. That is, it pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I can't believe this.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to transmit our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human awareness, the associated circuits (this for its direct sharing of short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus admit the foundation on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should be presented in the way man speaks: since a large part of life is related to language, it is often said to be related to conscience.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the animal’s awareness, as it is done, will certainly differ greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to see how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through one’s own experience because of the special hardware, their research will pose us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would be easier to access.
We could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is precisely the case in studies on the brief memory of primates, especially the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, we move on to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
So what does it mean for feelings?
I attribute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the localized defense system in the brain (or its consequences, such as the body’s reactions) occupies the working memory.
In this way, feelings are closely related to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and in particular the human being.
With speaking nature, subtle nuances of feeling are created, because we can distinguish and categorize situations with the help of words and grammar, to describe them to others.
Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings result from more primitive activity of the body regions of the sensations of the cortex and the cephalus paleo, similar to Jack Pankseep, who has nevertheless focused more on the cephalus.
Since this network over the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict it, however I find it indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and humans as fear probably feels that way to the senses in both cases: but how could it be verified, if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
Does a cockroach in case of danger run away as if he too felt fear?
In my eyes the mere resemblance of behavior cannot yet demonstrate any vital resemblance.
That is, the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalus, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalus responsible for feelings?
And even if it could be proved to humans: how would you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, here is progress at the neural level, as long as you renounce the same procedure on rats and men.
Just as I don’t do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t do research on their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This may be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually bump into a wall.
I am an emotional practitioner.
UEFA President Platini: postponement to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
Both host countries lame in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stadiums to be used by Europeans will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to work at maximum speed,” Grigori Surkis, the president of the Ukrainian association, said.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the national Olympic committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be “the serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparations for EM 2012 will not suffer."
Numerous members of the First Division only last season were convicted of manipulation, in the end they even had to postpone to the last moment the beginning of the League.
Dennis Quaid indignantly
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now has money with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared adultery his ex Dennis Quaid.
He foams out of anger and retaliates.
Delayed War of the Roses for ex-married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their split the two Hollywood actors now quarrel with each other over a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke out about the reasons for the marriage’s failure: “Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful.”
The extent of her betrayal would have come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for “soul stripping” was Ryan’s press work for his new film “The Women” – it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his being publicly declared an adulterous husband was blurred: it would be “unheard of,” the 54-year-old told the “New York Daily News,” which “Meg repeats and reworks the history of our relationship for the umpteenth time.”
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, would again be "publicly reminded of the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from separation lives alone, Quaid is married again and will soon become the father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrowhead: “My life goes on anyway.
I feel lucky to have a wonderful family that is all about the best."
Low prices for airline tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights are up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and hotel stays have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study of the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter saw a noticeable drop in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still surveyed on average around 6.9 compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the reason for this weak dollar quote, which would have led to a "warm desire to travel by American tourists"
Even financial centers like Frankfurt and London would be hit by the recession in hotel prices stronger than industrial centers like Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices the trend in the first quarter still marks up:
Due to higher kerosene prices, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, long-haul fuel-intensive flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June, the prices of Economy Class tickets fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in the first class and in Business the price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11,9 %, and in the second quarter they fell by 23,6 %.
As for domestic German flights, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price slump would be on the one hand downward economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, the open skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, would increase competition pressure.
Sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would declare bankruptcy – in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1 to 0
With a goal and simple methods the Hamburg SV becomes a leader.
At Borussia Luhukay he still can’t find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing of luck for the national team player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first came into the game late and failed with a shot on the crossbar.
His message was formulated with precision, it passed convincingly over his lips.
He knew he was absolutely right
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger exclaimed in the hallway of Hamburg's arena.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the game pause was over and most sat back in place.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, enjoying an even higher esteem than some older players.
And so his warning also found hearing in the upper spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here's the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Not everything was nice to see here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted to be “more relaxed.”
The Hamburgers must thank Mladen Petric for the 1 to zero and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
“It was a dirty win,” Martin Jol said.
The SV Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
Viewers celebrated themselves earlier, on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing leaderboard on the video screen, which legitimized their sports society as before class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We are able to put everything right,” said Marcell Jansen.
He has the feeling that the provisional certificate from the table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its new late arrivals – Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric goal as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern – is slowly finding itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling,” Jol says.
After the defeat of the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the failure of the rescue package temporarily dropped the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in its history.
Later the Down got back a little bit.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock market barometer listed/detected with a good 5% off of 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq tech exchange was stagnant with a deficit of more than 7% over 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which gave us just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do it.
Goldman Sachs shares fell by just 10%.
Just a few days earlier, the big investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
Under the bailout plan, financial funds were to be allocated for the collection of so-called mortgage documents.
The sum must be paid, however, not in one stroke, but in degrees.
As a matter of fact, the state had to maintain the Aktienoptionsscheine of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with an appropriate trend of the quotes, to reduce the charge for the state coffers.
Stocks in Europe and the US in the downward vortex
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the US do not erase investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate plummets and tears the German stock market index down
The US Dow Jones Index is back in the face of planned bailout of the financial market through the state.
Spectacular losses in the price of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pulled the German stock market index into deep deficit.
The shares of the real estate lender of Monaco lost despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks temporarily 3 quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank yielded more than 20%.
The German stock market index DAX slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is listed with a deficit of 3.7% out of 5,839 points.
Global stock markets are falling on their knees.
In New York Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors feared that the $700 billion bailout package from the U.S. government might not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost in the first hour of business 334 points or 3.3% out of 10,809.25 points.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the Senate vote could follow on October 1.
Even the other European stock exchanges could only have one direction: in London at the moment the FTSE index fell by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Nikkei benchmark after initial earnings fell by 1.26% from 11,743.61 payers.

Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has flown through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fast-frozen fuel pipes, death by freezing now looms over her.
Scientists have had a mysterious phenomenon for years – the anomaly of Swing-by
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/push/swing in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical device as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What has been surprising scholars for years: rockets do not behave quite as one would expect under the law of gravitation.
There are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the pulling force of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton firmly believes as before Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
“Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter that could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about 10 years.
From her there emerges evidently a force of attraction, the effect of which on other celestial bodies is seen.
Instead, she herself is completely invisible, i.e. she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation at all, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter makes up at least one-fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a pre-release shootout, six kidnappers were found to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for the ransom are already under way.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the report by Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released
We’re looking at their health status,” Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The backstage of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released remains unclear, so the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the end of the abduction, before the Sudanese army unexpectedly killed 6 of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed on a ransom,” the official said.
It would have been “just a matter of taking over the hostages”, when suddenly came “this surprise”.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot and killed 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of 6 million euros from Germany; the money was supposed to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women as hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men should have been detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuses by stepfather 'led to suicide'
Years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, has been in prison for six years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise molested and blindfolded her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle’s friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were “emotionally dead,” and that she had “weted with life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She's thought to have suffocated herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter ending: "I bound and bound her."
“I didn’t sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when you were only seven years old.
“This unfortunate saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn’t, it would have been hard for the facts to end up in court.”
I notice the effects Stephanie’s father and mother describe having had on their daughter these years.
“Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy young man of success.”
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC learned.
The man was away from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
"They'll have thought this was being handled internally by the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause that concerns the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The leaked documents contained assessments of al-Qaaeda and the capabilities of Iraq’s security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of more than 80,000 pounds after the bailout of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has donated 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take money from savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The director general of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it was “irritating” that companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion pound loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is annoying that those institutions that have behaved cautiously... are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits they had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million pounds to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the association of construction companies, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
“It’s annoying that those institutions that have behaved cautiously in the recovering housing market are now called upon to pay part of the bill for those institutions that have been far less cautious.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account,” Cole added.
Interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest for an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk rises to 5 pennies per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five pennies per liter from Monday.
It’s the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after a research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to dump the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price last changed in 2002.
Ex-Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has refused a request for bail from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of the many corruption allegations hanging over her.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is expected in the coming weeks but his party, Awami League, has called for the country’s military-backed temporary government to give him full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is unclear under the terms of her release whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the Alta Court order.
“The High Court has refused the bail request for Sheikh Hasina on the grounds that she cannot have the bail as she is already abroad on the word for medical treatment,” says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will file an appeal against the High Court order."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
He expects Sheikh Hasina's return home after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan anti-polio campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign because of Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But he is said to be unable to reach the children in Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this happened despite promises by the Taliban that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of staff carrying the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival television station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition’s appeals court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in a 2006 deal that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's stake in ITV sowed doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom’s regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was sparked by fears that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or appraised," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But later it emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been rated poorer than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the lawsuit against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute cases on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for layoffs, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials resigned.
(The inspector general's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in the layoffs, that he had abdicated his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush's former senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf Epic to be Celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will retire his special gold award at next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honoured" to earn the award.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of the 1977 Meat Loaf album hit.
Coldplay will lead this year’s awards nominations, being on the nominee list in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, “There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those.”
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell remained on the chart for nearly nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf – real name Marvin Lee Aday – has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
It emerged later that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crosswalks, some famous, others merely of use.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and goes north from the First Road – without going to the Second Road – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy road.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The road, however, must have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of newly built luxury buildings on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the stately neighborhood of the past.
But the city’s preservation and development department, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the municipal district commission land use committee, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy roads.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of the Community Board 3 district.
"There is very little space left to the town property, and we would like the town to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
“There could be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access.”
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that it wanted to reopen the small street and install seats, including some to use for a cafe the real estate company hopes to rent out the space to.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was first made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the road, it doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main concern is to renew this derelict alley and turn it into a public utility,” he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Preservation Accommodation, said it was the city’s desire to sell the road and noted that the agency’s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
In comparison to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a light historical footprint.
Some believe it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
CBGB’s back door, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the cover photo set for Ramones’ album “Rocket to Russia.”
"The terrain was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, clods of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about “gentrification” of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the public-owned piece, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of cities almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah’s Vanishing New York (subtitled, “The Book of Lamentations: A Slightly Nostalgic Look at the Endangered City”), published part of a City History Speech that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, dead end, dark even by day and delimited doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with doorknobs, with weeks old newspapers flying along the slums."
With a few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran swiftly through the back of the street near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and a 22-ounce empty beer bottle lay next to a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby have said that they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that she would need to be a little beautified.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “were in black, dirty, disgusting places.”
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior fellow in California Studies and the senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School.”
Truly attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “African American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama’s educational plan specifically supports, among other things, “temporary bilingual education” for English students.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in classes of languages other than English, ignores his interest in bridging the learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The school’s students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth graders, an astonishing 100 percent of students took the upper-level test in the 2008 state math exam.
Equally astonishing 93 percent of fourth graders took the expert level test on art-of-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama’s favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an “no excuse” attitude.
Moreover, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s obstructive approach to English students is “full immersion.”
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We had a fantastic success with a freshman student from Mexico and if you were in class 12 months later you wouldn’t have been able to figure out which one it was.”
"It works," he noted, "for us it works."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Hispanic-majority schools and with English students?
The school’s achievements make the answer to that question very easy, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-time supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevents it from predicting Mr. Obama’s answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the topic trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about “English-only” legislation.
Instead, he said, “you have to make sure that your children are able to speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work rather than despising or trivializing them.
Oil drops sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the U.S. bailout for financial markets may not be able to lift the economy.
Oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Stock Exchange in morning trading.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial turmoil on Wall Street, and by pairs of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plummeted to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before rising again amid tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
The anxiety hit investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgish governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the hectic weekend trades had led to a bailout deal “appear to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.

The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone in the Jets uniform for the past eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter play out on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
"I've never seen such a thing," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had matched the grayness of the menacing clouds that overshadowed them with a flaccid game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon where their growing tuning took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
“I didn’t get off my path,” Favre said of all the passages that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people may think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catch games, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner hard.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a loose throw and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens makes a Warner fumble.
The last turnover, the forced fumble by Bowens, may have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals were ahead on that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had picked up the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, for a 34-to-0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were told – the Jets gave 21 unanswered points in the third quarter – Mangini said: “I can tell you that I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third.”
There were a lot of points in a small amount of time.”
Rested Gebrselassie surpasses his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathoner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile race under the 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the favorably flat run in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered his previous score of 2:03:26 last year in Berlin for 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record for such an astonishing career that he has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would make his asthma problems worse.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a scorching average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-tourists such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo from the Brazilian Coast won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had calf cramps and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well.”
He has been somewhat criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival – for overly orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars, relying on track openers as if it were a mid-bottom race, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish Gebrselassie’s proficiency as a marathoner.
With the pace paced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie in competition after the track openers vanished.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final climb to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi came third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but she healed to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a large detachment, picking them up after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the theme park extended on the outskirts of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come into life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city incorporated into the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as he described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city it has described – and makes tourists stop by including it in Florida’s tour guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project – remains a place apart.
It’s as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that “knowing so little about us, he doesn’t know what he’s missing.”
Even now, in a year where a black nominee for president, Senator Barack Obama, was called in for an opening speech on race, many here remain wary of the outsider’s gaze.
“We are very cautious about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and a member of the city’s oldest church.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power grab and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shade of the oaks of southern black rural culture - sometimes despised, sometimes awarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the preoccupation with the image of Eatonville really began with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through candid, dialect-rich books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five Florida guide paragraphs transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the often-forgotten center of Florida within a scenario of black history and human drama.
Low on both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
“Away from the left,” he wrote, “is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could just read and write.”
She also mentioned widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits the passage rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this was not Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
“Zora was saying it as it was,” said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson’s girls whom Hurston immortalizes by quoting men singing gross songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston plummeted into the city, he usually arrived without warning in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts of decent clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others whispered.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging in his chair on the back patio above Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no great conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a 2003 biography of Hurston.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando’s expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 through the city’s western boundary.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had ended the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the door of the community.
“During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on one side,” says Mr. Franklin.
“We actually had a girl who was killed by that one once.
They threw a watermelon out of a car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor to my race."
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, despite being positive in some respects, dilutes the cohesion of Eatonville and jeopardizes the confidence of its young people.
"Black kids were used to being hugged - I remember this - hugging your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You weren't embracing your white teacher because your white teacher -- I mean, there's a cultural divide there," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writer, actress, and artist who overcame prejudice, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like, “How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to Hurston’s unmarked grave and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit bookstore shelves, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had once again turned the limelight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing in 1988 a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its project on the street.
"The five lanes of the resuscitated highway brought what would be high speed, a real pride for the city," Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd puts it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the highway project helped change the image the city has of itself.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began appearing in large numbers, and residents began reevaluating the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a revamped and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a side street in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It’s 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to search for the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permission requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, at some things - such as the murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, which show black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a naughty teacher, with a soft spot for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of city pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing her entire race: beautiful, trouble and everything, no better, no worse and fair, creative, great worker, silly and confused as other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s grandson, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, which he said may need help.
And even younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“A lot of people, if they just got in here, will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” Kenon said after mass on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a pretty city.”
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspaper stalls and huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t notice being in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, honeycomb over their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise New York live every day the worst “bad day in the office” since the collapse of 1929.
The stewards shake metal trolleys for tea across the sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 broken stretched shirts hanging on a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagels at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on a working day.
It didn’t seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier’s desk, to collect money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my “trusted banker,” were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from places where they commute, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took the money from the so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit unions and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and they say they treat customers like family members.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been submitted to controlled administration, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The employees and clerks in front of me, frightened by another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become proficient in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her emaciated CEO Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge, almost fifty of my condo, changed the theme compared to our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, “Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I’ve changed, I’m not taking any risks.”
Muslim tombs desecrated while Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs representing mosques with a red line passing in between.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties gained a lot in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but the detectives believe it may have been an attempt to disguise extremist motivations driven by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is related in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria, meanwhile, has embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its right-wing turn in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The two far-right parties that took nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burqas and also voiced his opposition to foods that are perceived to be connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties appear to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the election, which established the far right as the nation’s strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought about predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travelling abroad is forbidden to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain from court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the authorities that he wanted to go to Spain via France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent police last Thursday after they provided magistrates with evidence of Glitter's previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at the Ashford prefecture in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford Prefecture, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's trip abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the sex offender registry.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police seven days notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority can lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter moves in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of the Kent police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of convicted sex offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter arrived he flew to Bangkok where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities would not have passed him to passport control and he eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to let him in and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge prefecture, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him in the sex offender registry.
Glitter was previously incarcerated in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source at the interior ministry said Jacqui Smith, the secretary of the interior, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no steering wheels, no clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, grasping it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the program of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, which is growing every day,” explains the artist and clarifies that in “Flamenco-People” they could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed “on the street” are “artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capturing the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are interior.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco.”
With a passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and the material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own flamenco conception: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of conquering the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited at the exhibition.
The passion for portraiture led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love portraying people, getting to know them and being able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or a short moment.
I think portraiture is the hardest genre in photography.
You meet or compare with people, characters you sometimes don’t even know or who only give you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, like a photographer, I always try to put my ideas into practice.”
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he's writing is a "gambling"
It is set in places he does not know yet and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in Congo and has crossed the Amazon.
Always a favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
“If I had common sense, I wouldn’t write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible,” he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was, as predicted, the leading figure in the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the writer most voted by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens’ book “Our mutual friend”, filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to which he flew the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humor, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "pleasure to read" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in
The Spanish-American novelist, recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa pointed out, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "it makes people more nonconformist."
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of the rushes
The celebration of the races that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the races had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The weather has intensified against this Festival preventing it from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the running of the second bullfight.
On the billboard were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who would face a Castilblanco bull.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and being carried out in triumph, after toreto with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two runs, taking greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than thanks to the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing from the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mule, he gained the whistle of much of the public.
A van with two thousand kilos of hash crosses the checkpoint in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
The officers summon the two occupants of a van to escape instead of stopping.
The officers summoned the two occupants of a van and instead of stopping they fled.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers, after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Interior Department of the Basque government.
The arrested person is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident occurred when some Alava road officials were conducting a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, violating orders, accelerated sharply and crossed the checkpoint.
The officers pursued until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped at the edge of the road and its two occupants escaped into a forested area.
The Ertzaintza agents were then able to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hash they were carrying and they took note once the van, an Iveco Daily, was inspected.
The hashish pads, which were in the back of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since officials found that the matriculation had been "duplicated" because it did not match the one in the van's documentation, the arrest was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as mentioned above, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee A. A. J., 28, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, a California street spokesman told People magazine.
The witness specified that around 4.30pm Locklear "crushed the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to take the car out of the parking lot with abrupt manoeuvres back and forth.
Shortly after, the witness, who at first glance had apparently not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and got out of the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"She looked confused," and for that reason the agents took her to a specialist drug and alcohol center to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has proven cooperative and the excess alcohol hypothesis was dismissed from the outset, although "according to what officials initially noted, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effect of some unspecified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized after an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the United Left party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of the formation to make a decision on the case of the former adviser to Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt regarding what has been an adviser in the Seville council to date.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would commit. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to have maximum transparency."
He also stressed that the training is regulated by "very stringent ethical codes for all public offices."
"May Blood", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Episodes Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci proposes in Sangre de mayo the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros in budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría leading a wide cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and thinks he has to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before shooting a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2nd.
The 15 million budgets allocated in full by the Community of Madrid represented a "unique opportunity" for Garci to recreate the scenery and costumes appropriate to portray a "stupid Spain that erred the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under Ferdinand VII" noted Garci.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los phantoms de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes from the set that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator for almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volvera a commencia, influenced what is his usual working practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work lies in going to the theater and to the cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the performers, some of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de Mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Oscar nominee four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billiard français and, the latest selected Los girasoles ciegos -, do represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
From this film Garci does not expect prizes.
“At first you think you’re working for the posterity, then you realize that you’re just working for prosperity, and at some point you’re just going to shoot an extra film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer pays tribute to another dancer from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and at the age of three she moved with her family to London.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dance.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the likes of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and advocated for the abolition of corsets that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this character.
The dancer says: “We do not pretend to tell her whole life, but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "la danza de la motosa" suggested me a guajira, or "la danza de la serpente" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic,” she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, such as "La puerta aperta"; and that of teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been a pupil of her.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I’m happy because he agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about that.”
The arrangement also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal accompanist of these artists who have always had a lot of spasim.
In some form is also present the life of this woman, which takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, habitually, she resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her, because I think she’s one of the women who had a huge influence in a given period of history and now no one remembers her, much less sees her work as something of value,” Bayon said.
The show will begin today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega theater.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poète pas-married" (Diary of a newlywed poet) the Triennium also closes.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Recicansado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Council of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennio of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" the anniversary of the "fifteenth anniversary" (2006-2008).
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" ends with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House-museum and with the touring exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is planned with New York.
In addition, the Department of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Recicansado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the spread of the figure and work of one of the Andalusian poets of the highest value.
America likes it a little less without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and all of America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
It was hard for him to give him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He also knew that he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country could have been better because of its existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark time, out of fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, desperate for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and there are people to admire, you don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn who died of overdoses to the creation of the brand of homemade and organic food.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, with no regard for nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, remarked that a man did not die, an era is over.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
“He has left an example of the highest standard for all of us,” says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for righteousness and to have a serious private life and away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some try it and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful while he certainly did not lack opportunities not to be.
"Why do I go out to eat hamburgers today, if I have a steak in my house?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles she played, no one was as proud as her devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather, and passionate philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, that if they were taken into account at the time of the evaluation and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the backbone, which presupposed that it was gone first.
It didn’t seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, let it be to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid the queues during the race).
Not at all.
You had to go only to take the back (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they had t-shirts only of size 'S' (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
In what world do we live?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small t-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like that are inefficiencies compared to the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race in which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once they succeeded in the enterprise, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened to wait for more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts at popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the ranking in the correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, did not correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it will certainly not come into my mind.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft looking for receptionist (virtual)
At MIT’s Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft previewed a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company’s campus) assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen to and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group those present in conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he is not in the group with which he is talking and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be available soon.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But, of course, this is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have many programs associated with it.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for “less.”
A whole discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
You perform the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more attention to the web browser.
It takes your computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and every day we spend more time surfing the net than in a remote windowed environment.
What does half of the operating system’s applications do?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a viable alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I give here a small example.
I took the photo inserted in this post in one of the Microsoft employee recreation rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
On the beverage machine a sign urges them to use their own search tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to search online.
Last week, however, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be put on the market in the early months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it to the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's Diamante de sangre, as well as Francis Ford Coppola's Al Pacino in The Godfather in addition to being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the forzuto with the sharp moustache that lifts the weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's t-shirt, with the cotton interior, tight and sleeveless.
It’s the ‘tank’, as English speakers call it, although Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the t-shirt carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not only about the famous "tanks".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, navy shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Underwear designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
“I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new business in the fashion field very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the firm Mango made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, it conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
What are the elements of your new collection for Mango in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the 50s and 60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love getting lost in the city and watching how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it often.
Dancer, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, although in the end, everything merges and there are many elements in common.
Since I was a child, I loved clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to browse my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid close attention to dressing.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to the sages, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they give you the wardrobe is the time when you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for stylists and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into crisis?
But no.
Never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to savor life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was a child, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're going to be a mother, don't you?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me for it and also I want to be a young mother, this I do not want to miss.
As for the candidate, I don’t worry too much.
What I’m going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you’re waiting for some movies shot last year to come out in different theaters.
That's right, and I really want them to come out.
Being a woman coming from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can not always be so.
I want to see "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ" come out.
Let's see if you like
A few days ago you debuted on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like you were on the catwalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I’ve known for a long time, called me to invite me to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization “Women for a Better World” and the clothes we showed – I brought two pieces of our collection to Mango – were auctioned off to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this soft side of Naomi.
There are so many things said about her that I, who have known her for a long time, can confirm that they are not so true.
Also, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pine, I would do it anyway.
If it's to help the women of the third world, you can't back down.
Relapsed drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, install in his car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of drunkenness or if he does not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Attorney General’s Office, according to which it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The aim of this project is the reinstatement of the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the General Prosecutor for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Fondazione Tecnologico per la Seguridad dell’Automobile (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more than once per drunk driving then return to driving the car.
The alcoholic beverage would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents it from starting the car if the driver does not blow, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than allowed.
The cost is over 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: curbing these behaviors before they become criminal offenses.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, undoubtedly, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
At 5.40 p.m., on the second programme, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced the hand to be used as a visor to see the royal pair descend from the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours before I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that time...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press knows very well who the principles of Asturias are and the importance of travel.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and military cordon made up of 27 navy soldiers who offer the salute of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, comes to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they have told her that in Mexico City she threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a brief stop before passing through the room where the official entourage awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a witty Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than Paris and there is probably no more exquisite and bont vivan designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to foster the international promotion of new talent in the fashion field.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept with emotion.
Moreover, it is the second largest store of the company in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite canvases of Chagal, the presidential table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, heartbroken and making virtue of necessity, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take his breath away and at the arm of his son Luis - a boy of almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the dinner of tribute.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of home and knight which he finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because they had both given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirt – drawn by her own hand – turned for dinner, wearing a very sensual long black dress and was thrilled during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the room for the ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and "abgrassed it."
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the building premises, but she had shown us photos of her son on her cell phone before.
The next day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boy who moved on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having made sure before that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7am, but it is even worse to imagine yourself getting involved in the hectic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer backaches.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the struggle to get rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole "menu" of options tailored to each person's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 Ways to Relax" and its calm will reach libraries thanks to publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this “handbook” denies that belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as staying in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn’t already flow into your veins to regain your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, shut down your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I do not mean those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but those children who talk while staying asleep.
The first time it happens, at best it takes a scare, but it doesn’t really matter much.
This is a benign sleep disorder called sleep disorder.
It manifests itself with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single reason for this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nighttime fears, nighttime enuresis (pissing in bed), or sleepwalking, but this is not necessarily the case.
As mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stressful situations or overexcitement.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks in a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (crying, screaming, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet for the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if paired with insomnia or stressful situation).
What you can do, however, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to overexcite your baby before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or TV shows that incite fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
Once the sleepwalkers appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he’s talking, he’s sleeping and so he’s resting.
Remember that if you appear very distressed and episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety comes from in the child.
If you understand what he says (which isn’t the most common situation), don’t fall into the temptation to interview him for information.
You will get nothing because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not see what he is dreaming of saying, so you need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions it might lead to.
Never tell your child that you could ask him questions at night to learn his secrets.
Not even a joke.
Something like that causes a huge anguish.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing serious, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally.
The Illhaeusern have finally found their way home after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Blacks created the most network opportunities turning one into the win of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves toiling.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who touched the seven with a shot from afar, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain tip and again Diebold.
Dannemarie responded with a midfield block, leaving only the unleashed Riahi at the point of attack.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the first Marais net for Illhaeusern, well positioned, he resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the gunner of the Illhaeusern will not be able to savour his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later thus leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, backtracked just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last few minutes of the game when, after a rocky action, the ball touched the cross.
Sarkozy meets Angry Fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
Before the demonstration of the fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the president of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome it "with a constructive spirit" and hope that "it will be presented with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the surge in the price of diesel, which reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them about possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and to make working conditions and the salaries of sailors safe."
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon Peninsula a road blockade has been implemented.
On Monday the sailors have already demonstrated their determination by burning, from dawn, tires and vanes in front of the fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where fishing vessels remained at the dock, or to Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the well-known Total refinery in Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting that will be held Wednesday at the ministry to decide on any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the eventual participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported the movement.
"The strike will continue" as "the fishermen will not give in" and "they do not intend to move to Paris," Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, said in a statement.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter, but estimate that the performance limit of a boat is reached only with a diesel oil of less than 0.30 euros per liter.

Embraer maintains delivery forecast in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest airline, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with the delivery of 215 aircraft, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
During the first half, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, particularly for aircraft in the 30- to 120-seat range.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, reinstated by US monetary authorities, would sell more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider selling much of its assets, in addition to selling life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the paper said on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at AIG.
The assets AIG intends to divest include the airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 percent stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly repay the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities seize 80% of its capital.
Paris: History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange experienced a historic crash on Monday after the House of Representatives spoke out against Paulson’s plan to bail out financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a never-before-seen drop, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq lost 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) exceeded that of September 17, 2001, the day of the reopening of the exchanges following the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq, the top tech stock index, lost 199.61 points to close at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to close at 1,106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the start of the session, Wall Street plunged after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favor, the representatives refused the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two in three Republicans rejected the plan.
“It’s a negative signal to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“All this signals how much the market relied on the project,” he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be “too late” to adopt one.
“If the project were actually dying ... then the witness would quickly be passed to the Fed and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight, said in a statement.
And again highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, stressed the Piegza.
After the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities arranged the purchase of Wachovia’s banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging urgent intervention in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets “are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis,” added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell to 3.632 percent, down from 3.827 percent on Friday night, while the 30-year yield was 4.161 percent, down from 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama wins the first TV duel
After Friday’s first debate between the two White House candidates, here’s a second to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes John McCain’s performance, while deserving, was not bright enough to allow him to curb the drop in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat got the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% bet on McCain.
A strong performance by his fellow listing mate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm Obama’s lead on Thursday.
“Undervaluing it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition," Clinton said this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable foreign policy experience, emphasizing the "naiveness" of the adversary regarding the issues addressed during the first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that.. he has often stated on multiple occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president,” he said.
What has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without lengthening, it proved concise and precise.
He promoted his readiness to make the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
“McCain never understood, unlike Obama,” he retorted this weekend, blaming the Republican for failing to take the necessary steps to address the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a rush of rain, for an election meeting.
He didn’t even say the words “middle class” or “workers.” The financial crisis goes in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the verge of the cliff.
“Next week could be a turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s economic insights to Clinton’s during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse “is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming his intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street upheavals, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
Cautiously, the two candidates shied away from the $700 billion ($470 billion) bailout plan adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "didn't you notice there was an election?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest in advance the results of the legislature.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of the polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While they were still waiting for the results, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "What pro? They will do as much as they want, of my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good appearance in front of foreign observers with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to embark on a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the stripping of votes," complained Yuri Potemkin, a spokeswoman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
“It’s a change of façade,” said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition presidential candidate in 2006 and the leader of the pro-European movement, “because it’s who counts the cards and in this case it’s the executive.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings, and bills.”
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter into the political game because "it is necessary to initiate dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that has followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the ballot.
He stresses that participation quotas seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has started all kinds of manipulation.
“Did you not notice that the elections were held?” asks the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will have been at most five opposition MPs in parliament, the most convenient ones in power.”
Night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are pleased with their success.
The blood is safe again.
Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, it regained the public’s trust, seriously shaken by the blood-infected scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood supply managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service was infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Faced with such a tragedy and protests from the population, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public inquiry, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the resumption of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was slow to draft a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of devising a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau committee.
As a result of the Gélineau et Krever relations in Canada, two suppliers were created: Héma-Québec to supply Québec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38 percent of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood collections and field research over the following years, we have regained the public’s trust,” he explains, before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec’s population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that “trust is something extremely fragile”.
Since its creation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says her who has been the president since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
This was based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when you have doubts and could get a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been proven that this disease is undoubtedly transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (TANs) that allow to directly recognize in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have allowed us to reduce the window period, that is, from the moment the person contracted the disease to the moment when the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not being able to detect them has thus greatly decreased.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, this means you’ll need to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion is found.
I believe that today you can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover your health, says the head of management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
A year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by an insect.
You have to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before pointing out that in addition to having secure resources, Héma-Québec must also provide enough.
“The needs increase as the population ages.
Being the most aggressive cancer treatments, patients often need an intake of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the number of donors, which on average constitutes only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec acceptable as donors.
All healthy people who are 18 years old and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who volunteer as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where it is widespread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
“With this 3% we manage to maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
Cases of shortage are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this group of donors as they get older and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them back and incite them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so hectic that it’s hard to find an hour to donate blood,” says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eyeball heart valves and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being deposited at Héma-Québec, which runs the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is plenty of stem cell-rich blood that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the bank entry of our thousandth cord blood sample and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
They should start to be proposed for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes the practice of cord blood collection as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they can't access them," because Héma-Québec doesn't have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Football - The Impact in the semifinal
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-finals of the Serie A qualifiers, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday during a decisive second game of the quarterfinals, at Stade Saputo.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90'.
After a first time without goals on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
Remember that in the first round-trip game on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundler filled a first 3-1 in the return game by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still play in the semifinals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both on Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed later in the day.
In short - Decisive network of Kovalev
The Canadian and his axes are ready to start the season again.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for victory, in the fourth of Hab's preparatory games.
The only network signed by Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian said.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to overdo it in the first period," Guy Carbonneau said.
But I think he liked the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation.”
Charest points to the North
The prime minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
The general council of the Liberal Party concluded, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to get elected on the occasion of today’s by-elections.
"Broadening the borders of our last great northern frontier": this is Jean Charest's long-term ambition, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of tools with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Mühle to images".
On three maxi screens, spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc. were confused.
Great means like in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he said he was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labor, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the prime minister’s most recent speeches, the opening of the North – the northern territory to the 49th parallel – had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but did not comment on timing or investment quotas, as well as explaining what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
He has at most pointed out what he believes deserves a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure has experienced several improvements.
According to Charest’s list, the North contains “nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds.”
That "large territory twice as big as France" is here, it's Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us,” he insisted, as if to solicit a national founding myth.
Quebec's foundations are rooted in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: the gold rush in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
“It’s up to us, it’s our future,” he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the press conference.
"It's a position traditionally held by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government,” he said.
"Considering climate change, we need to reassess the North," he said of the Northwest Passage, which will be open year-round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.”
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project would serve their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former PQ deputy from Ungava), have already launched the consultation of about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position, has begun work.
The prime minister doesn’t rule out a big meeting, “not necessarily a summit,” but a time when “common visions will be provided.”
The development of the North would be based on the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "agreed, ordered and respectful of the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves in order to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was indeed one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage as head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Station in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to shape the future,” said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another reference, conservative this time, was made to John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest specified that its commissioning would be scheduled for 2012.
“All this remains between us, but I feel we will do it,” he confessed to his militants, eliciting a heartfelt applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who in April said there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a poll in the fall, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very busy, particularly at a federal council mission in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smoothly like oil: the PLQ demands above all the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hopes that Quebec will nominate members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto over decisions made in Quebec.
As for the opposition, the North Plan draft was sceptical.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, dusted Quebec’s Northern Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
In her opinion, the Liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not respect its application.
If he had done so, “we would have made progress today,” Marois said alongside Jean-Talon candidate Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has said it supports the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
“What we hope is that all this is not simply perceived as a spectacle,” said Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont’s replacement, on his way back from the holidays.
Letters - A disgraced country
It was Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (irony of fate) of the Harper Cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to declare that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration speaks volumes about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated a citizen of its own detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the events accused him.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information purposes, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, call for the return of Omar Khadr so that he can be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is the very government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
He doesn’t realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of freedom and of “democracy,” a word that Harper keeps on flaunting and that sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we come to the moment when there is no morality: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a leader who has been a minority until now (to see what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for the Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Here lies the shame, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world’s largest gold company filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small, squatted publishing house with the intention of initiating a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a defamation lawsuit, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to hers.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the writers and publisher of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a considerable amount of money in order to organize their defense and fight, with decidedly odd weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by the practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these unequal arms fights, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual settlement that will overwhelm the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to pronounce again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates are usually held with the exchange of opinions and not at the whiplash.
It would have been enough for the company to open its books, its documents, and set up a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications, and funding from teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and wrongly rejects petitions and letters in support of Black Canada authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate" when his contempt for that same audience is clearly evident?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word indicates only profusely paid lawyers and not the whole of Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of opinion, and not from the perspective of what many perceive as a kind of embarrassment (in seeking the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum urging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver’s surreal discourse, the Barrack Gold lawsuit constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies the right to cite authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and argue about uncomfortable topics for the richest companies in the world, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following scientific norms as the authors of Canada Nero do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to her claims, she is not seeking a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as is the case with the public debate itself in Canada, and it is time for governments to adopt measures to limit abusive lawsuits.
Operation – Rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic factions, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest bailout-finance plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to curb the months-long financial crisis on Wall Street, has yet to be ratified by the two houses of Congress.
It provides in particular: checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right of inspection on the remuneration paid to the managers of the protected enterprises.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We have made great progress toward an effective market deal,” said Bush administration Representative Henry Paulson.
“Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the American economy and people from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
“It’s the crucial point: If we hadn’t acted in this way, invaluable discomfort and turmoil would have poured into the daily lives of Americans,” said U.S. Rep. Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The time limit agreed corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Joining later in the negotiation, the two candidates for the US presidency have been rather supportive of the agreement, while still expressing their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with adding some provisions to the agreement, particularly the one that will allow owners to maintain their domicile and that related to salaries for executives of companies covered by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on the American television screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he will vote in favor of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
“According to what I’ve read, it’s something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward.”
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The 700-billion-dollar plan aims to repurchase with taxpayer money the dubious, risky and unsold assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a housing bubble that led first to the collapse of at-risk (mutual) mortgage loans, then to extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and lead to the freezing of liquidity and the upheaval of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge who aired the first draft of a deal last week.
They seem to have come out of that dead end since the Democrats accepted that the “toxic” assets of some struggling companies are only protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision has been added that if the government were to face losses over the next five years because of that program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which may be added another 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The $350 billion payment is expected to be ratified by a further vote by Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shareholdings in protected businesses that will earn him dividends in case of profit and that he can resell when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the foreclosure procedures related to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and start-up allowances paid to the executives of the companies involved.
Starting today, the plan’s architects would like to put it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is still not certain that their plan will be given free rein.
Yesterday there were several votes against the bill, both on the Republican and Democratic side.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican House Finance Committee member Scott Garrett told voters.
“We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But it doesn’t take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed “the caucus of skeptics,” Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to say: We ask Congress not to jump to conclusions and to carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the test of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would abandon the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) for the crisis of at-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of Europe’s twenty largest banks and ten largest insurers.
"It's not the money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, influence and voting rights are levied on banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are uncertain.”
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British government seems to be on the way to nationalizing another bank in the balance sheet for the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all of the loans currently underway at Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander said it would buy the UK bank’s branches and customer accounts.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weak spot.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the bewitching smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would expel him from that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who passed away on Friday at the age of 83, on his Connecticut ranch following lung cancer, remains one of the last American film icons of the fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and of which he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also a spokesman for freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
From mixed couples are often born magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Because he was recognized as a land of safe made man, of the Pacific War fighter, proud in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, he subsequently attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, on television and soon in cinema.
The same civil rights activist was also the second-placed car driver at the 1979 Mans 24 Hours, as well as a sex symbol, although he has been part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They leave with him the shadow zones of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to the scandals of show business, whose mystery will never be completely revealed.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend, Paul Newman’s passing was a heart attack for moviegoers, as his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy (1969) and that boy unable to want his fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Burning Cat adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep what he promised.
Many more Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Up Somebody Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and reprised after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive billiard player in Robert Rossen's The Spaccone (1961), Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 the only Oscar on 9 nominations.
That face through the years, it was hers.
Still him.
The epochs follow each other through his path.
He is best known for George Roy Hill's cult movie Slap Shot (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in Mr. Hula Hoop by the Coen brothers in 1994.
The circle closed with one last Irish Mafia godfather role in Era my father, in 2003.
Unlike the highest-ranking film legends who soon left the craft, Newman will stay in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its glory, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, called it, with a touch of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging his performances to be exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, drunken carnations or despair, of which he expressed debauchery and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, modest sensibility.
Jennifer’s first time in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward as the protagonist, traced a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade in arms Robert Redford (who had starred together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness, “His presence has made my life and this country better.”
Generosity and love for life, two great features of the missing actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent filmmaking, a contestant of Hollywood drift, dies.
We will have seen her face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging her to be a poor taste choice, although born as gag.
However, the proceeds from these sales went to his Children's Foundation in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of leaning on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying, “Always and to the end, your father has been incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege.”
And just as privileged was it for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, then, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Partners invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the hearing of the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and partners will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed as part of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from competition calls was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the carrying out of the activities by means of fake invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million guldens, ended up in part in the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, reported by the investigating authorities, they have withdrawn the money obtained from competition notices on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the blocks of invoices were purchased at the Józsefváros market, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue the invoices, it was established among other things during the trip through the hills over the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to his confession, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for the consumptions, modelled after these were then prepared the invoices to be forwarded to the competition calls, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the City of Budapest.
A large part of these are the work of István Lados and András ?ri, who, according to our information, has drawn up mainly the reports necessary to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "journey studies" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurant owner, would not all enter the restaurant together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövèrt Foundation, later named Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért, is full of formal and content errors.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however there were 130 guests on the invoice.
But the compilers of the fancy-filled invoices exaggerated when they reported to Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, whose accounting - according to information issued to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents on behalf of Jobb Jövért and Hoppá companies.
The company’s director, Gyoz Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and the invoices were shown to him, he immediately realized that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and the VAT match of our company were at the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, there was also the fact that according to the invoice one hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
On the other hand, the invoice was for catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for some time.
Frequent invoice compilers did not bother to learn that the Budapest travel agency of their choice only organizes trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with cash payment trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing invoices of the company.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also included on the invoice, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of the VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favor of the Jobb Jövèrt Foundation, in fact, on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply the VAT at 15% and not 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, while the invoice was written by hand.
In addition to this, the "issuers" ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as activity carried out the transport of goods by road, as is known from the prosecution procedure, activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
Also for formal defects - non-conforming invoice size cause, fake stamp - it was found that invoices issued in favor of Együtt to Harmadik Evezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are fake.
The same was the case for Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Field, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) there lunched a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, precisely for this reason the curator of the liquidation of the firm, according to our information, denied that he issued that invoice.
They issue invoices knowingly.
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million gulden.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of the Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and partners also with Biogate Kft, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices worth about 5 million gulden to the Jobb Jöv?ert Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny Egyesület Association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
No movement of money because the prepared invoices were then reversed, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those who are connectable with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to contact the general manager of the Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 related to the sale of computer equipment, worth about 18 million gulden.
According to the data of the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The director-general of this firm was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov would forward documents concerning the firm between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian bricklayers founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies were operational because the defendant said they had not received a job.
However, the companies were useful because, at the request of the co-deputy lawyer Zsolt Szente, the editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: the Atlasz and the Y-Generación.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued 15 invoices worth 14.2 million gulden.
The prosecutor's office believes that Kubatov pocketed 10% of the amounts shown on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition call.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a tender for the Socialist Party's public utility, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guldens per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the call.
In order for this not to come to light, they presented TMA with five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing a part of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecutor's office, will probably report on the development of the production of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the number one defendant, János Zuschlag, decided to lift the veil on everything.
His confession has so far not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
We must see if it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for compensation of 50 million gulden, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag for now could also have been offended as his demands to lighten his conditions of imprisonment, namely the granting of house arrests, have so far not been met.
While the perpetrators of non-compensable commercial crimes and causing much greater harm can freely walk around or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The Psychology of Excess Bidding: Why Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers are likely to spend more, overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have managed to uncover the neuro-economic underpinnings of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, men do not want to be left behind in a race such as the eBay auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "match" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active areas of the brains of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex comes into operation intensively when you lose to the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price increase is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial tracking survey.
In this survey three groups bid against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was told how much the actual value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
Another group has promised that in case of winning they will receive another prize of $15.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would lose money in the event of a loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the win was stressed, while for the other the loss.
Proving the neurologists’ hypothesis, members of the group who played “against the loss” were willing to make higher bets than the control or “winning” group.
“These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These thus far explained the phenomena encountered at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only methods of creating the neurological image have helped solve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor in the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to go to the doctor?
Nearly half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death in Hungary.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis sufferers amounts to one hundred thousand, of these only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the food channel (e.g., water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For those who travel it is useful to get vaccinated against the virus A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots form on the skin and white of the eyes, feces become light and dark urine, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancers and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancers.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
Worldwide, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease it is worthwhile to consult your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by patient associations around the world.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God feel less pain?
According to a recent survey, religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford have performed an interesting experiment, examining how faith in god affects the sensation of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out on 12 Catholic believers and atheists, while all were observing a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to repel much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploration technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling pain.
The test is the first in a series of researches in which scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University take part in addition to academics.
The test was done exactly this way: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the seventeenth century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci's hermitage painted in the fifteenth century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a kind of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to have a tranquilizing effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and during this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel “safe,” as if “someone cared for them” and “were reassured and were filled with peace.”
Looking at the religious-themed image, they accounted for 12% less pain than when Leonardo’s work was before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but we must find the right image.
“We have to look for an image that they have very positive feelings toward, like a mother or father,” he said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality,” Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of this caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On their 10th birthday, Google can claim to be as much in people’s pockets as in the sky above their heads; they know where they spent their holidays, what clinic they attend and what interests them.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the company, is still not enough.
What concerns skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the very substance of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main purpose is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google’s founders: “Let’s put all the information in the world into one system!”
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied: he would like to know if Google could answer questions like “what do I do tomorrow?” or “what’s the right job for me?” but software doesn’t know how to answer seemingly simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their search on the internet are recorded exactly the words searched, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago users can e.g. memorize their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these will then in the long run generate much better tailor-made results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - Google data monopoly users wonder.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of Internet users are provoked by the fear of the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
One fact is confirmed, however, that all searched expressions are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times has been perhaps the coordinated action against paedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify paedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internet users worried about personal rights sighed for relief in May when the firm - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even then Google cannot be forced with any point of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully ripped out nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to obtain individual users’ search lists and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: those who fear providing their personal data beat up Google because they believe that this is how their intimate sphere and private life is affected by starting to use its services and rise up with the rebellion of the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users who have appeared in many countries see in them the next generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as the conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code kept always up to date and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that list their musical tastes, all of these can insert them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which his most recent photo galleries automatically appear on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common tour of friends, comes to know easily who spent the night with her treacherous boyfriend or a company can fire its employee because he wrote a sincere opinion on the company summit: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has now completely reconsidered.
Those who live a life online make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just avoid the monopoly of Google can do so (starting with Scroogle using the Google search system but which at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are not a few people who do not sign up on purpose to community pages to not be found, Google’s online applications, from word processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best existing profile so far.
Public opinion doesn’t wait so long in secret when Google pulls its claws out.
Currently the company with its 156 billion dollars worth worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time cause great discomfort not only to Microsoft but also to many software development companies.
However, critical observers besides all this find alarming points: the company summit, for example, totally rejected the protest of employees after doubling the line of the company’s asylum, considered the repeated catering to the daily pleasure of employees too expensive, but all this diminishes in the face of the fact that in 2006 Google has bowed the head to the Chinese government and under their agreement will offer all the good results the Chinese company will filter.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, but one thing is certain, that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and storing books and magazines of Google will take on proportions that the company will soon find itself in front of our medical profile, others are afraid of this American Supreme Court.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the story Scroogled by the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped the double murderer of ZAD to make the traces disappear
Police have questioned two minors about the double murder of AZD, who are well-founded to have helped clear the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod region's police station said on Tuesday.
The young people have admitted the crime to them, they are currently accused of aiding.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI, defend themselves freely.
Benefits are punishable by up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect in the double murder of a 23-year-old local man, Izd, was put in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated mass murder for profit.
The investigation found that the 23-year-old had a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, which is why last Wednesday he tricked his creditor into a yard in Izd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a sign is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
Police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech kroner, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-owned.
99% of the stock is in the hands of the Polish state that intends to sell in a few months more than 60% of its stock.
The Czech financial daily E15 says that the supply of Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner among all stakeholders and did not rule out that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kronor.
According to the shareholder agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Homeland Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Bank of Czech Republic with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster came about thanks to the American president, who was unable to compact his party behind a savage law, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett put it, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 9/11.
Even a part of the press in Madrid sees in Washington the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy to the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat - mentions the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a bailout doughnut to staggering financial institutions and with taxpayer money they can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse like a domino effect, then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be enough.
In the long run, it is necessary for member states of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control over dismembered financial markets.
Weakened financial institutions alone got more than 100 billion euros on Monday - recalls the Vienna Der Standard, according to which the anxieties seem increasingly real that European taxpayers, similar to those of the United States, will have to put their hands on their wallets to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not worried much about the crisis that has crossed the old continent like a tsunami.
The “saviors” do not have to wave the €100 billion right away, however it would be better if they were to decide where to touch taxpayers’ money to prevent further damage.
The intelligent machine mimics the flight of the hornet
What could be the best method to develop anti-collision technologies if not mimicking the sensors of obstacles found in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the astonishing project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the Hornets gave the initial strategic inspiration to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic robot, a robotic mini-car with bee properties, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
Flying bees form their own personal oval space that really looks a lot like our protective shield - explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and R&D.
Important is the role of the sight of the bee, capable of a visual of 300 degrees in each direction.
The engineers took advantage of the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee’s view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the necessary measure to avoid the accident.
This avoidance manoeuvre, unlike the current system, takes place entirely instinctively.
“If it weren’t, the robot car wouldn’t react quickly to avoid collisions,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Lab and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaged and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities available to the bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lighter, high energy density lithium polymer batteries, which means that their lifespan is longer than that of lithium ions.
Andoh says it’s important to have the instantaneous intelligent reaction, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some inputs in seconds and react.
There is no need to store and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuvering data, so it only uses a memory of a few tens of Kb.
There is no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, according to Nissan, can be installed in 10 years on the series vehicles.
Another possibility of application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding the obstacles present on the road leads to the destination.
They also found the name of the expensive child.
A written version of the $700 billion bailout law was drafted for the purchase of the disproportionate credits, to be applied in multiple parts.
In the first step, half of the amount is spent.
In the new deals that lasted until midnight on Saturday according to East Coast time, congressional leaders decided on the $700 billion bailout plan after a debate that had lasted for days, Reuters reported.
“We have made serious progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the plan’s compromise.
Minister of the Treasury Henry Paulson speaking about the outcome of the compromise said that the program will work and be effective, but there is still much to do. According to Pelosi it is not about the rescue of Wall Street but the reversal of the economic tank.
The written version of the plan was made public prior to the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. Washington time (2 p.m. on Monday according to Central European time), but it did not bring great stock market growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the project defined as the 2008 economic stabilization law regarding the program, after which it will be up to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the news of the deal to the White House with joy.
“We are pleased with the progress made tonight and greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy,” said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman.
The program, however, differs from the original Bush administration proposal, which predicted that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step you will be able to spend at most half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the Congressional vote on Monday, with these the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special board will oversee the program in which the president of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The spending of the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of “poisoned” credits.
The purchase can be made through auctions and directly - have announced competent of the ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Treasury Department guarantees the means that give cause for concern, for which the companies will pay a price appropriate to the probable damages.
Henrz Paulson said: “The law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it’s buying the wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.”
We will take all the necessary steps to make us ready to introduce the newly signed law," he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their good fortune, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
Limitations on payments will only occur in some cases, furthermore the limitations depend on how the Treasury Department will offer help.
In essence, the restriction means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, if they do not retire the fallen bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of the disproportionate credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors’ money is not exaggerated.
To this it should be added that the existing contracts of the golden parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to incentivize participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history of the coming into force of a legal limitation regarding the remuneration of general directors - commented the measure the Democratic Barney Frank chairman of the committee responsible for financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to take over a share of the banks participating in the program, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also gain from it if the economy, and together with it the rescued bank, will get back on its feet.
The bill includes that in the next five years the president must submit a proposal to Congress that provides for how to return the expected losses arising from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
That’s not what American citizens have asked us to not defend taxpayer dollars,” said Rep. Darrell Issa.
Her fellow Ohio Democrat Mary Kaptur believes the moves were taken by the very ones who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industry prices continue to rise
The prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - reports the Hungarian Central Institute of Statistics.

As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were 0.7% higher than the previous month and 3.2% higher than a year ago.
Industrial domestic sales prices reported in the previous month increased by only 0.1%.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also rose to a minimal extent, by 0.1%, compared to July.
The biggest increase in prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoes manufacturing sector (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and shoe production with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the product and chemical industry.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electric tools and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum extent in woodworking (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In the other sectors of the machining industry there was a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in gas prices by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the sectors of the processing industry, the largest increases were in the sector of the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing of metalworking products, the increase in prices was 13.2%, and 11% in the production of foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco was a determining factor.
A decrease in prices occurred in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electric tools and machinery (0.3%).
In the other sectors of the machining industry the rate of price increase varied from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2% in the past year.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector exceeded those of last year by 18.7%.
In domestic sales among the target groups of the sectors, the largest monthly price increase occurred in August in the sectors that produce investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors that produce consumer goods prices have increased by 0.3%, in the energy sector and subsequent use prices have not changed compared to those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the largest price increase was observed in the energy sector and subsequent use (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods the increase was 6.8%, for investment goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
The prices of industrial export sales calculated in florins increased in August by 1.1% compared to the previous month, compared to 12 months decreased by 3.9%.
The Hungarian gulden weakened against the euro within a month by 1.7%, against the dollar by 7.1%, compared with August 2007, strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year in the U.S. without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the US-Hungarian visa-exemption agreement could enter into force - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion "now everything depends on the fact that the electronic entry and control system is built in time".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no more permission to enter, however, before departure tourists will have to be registered.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue talks in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, who will be awarded the Order of the Hungarian Republic Cross medal with the Star and will hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank bailout.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates for the two major U.S. parties, on Sunday pledged their support for the $700 billion government plan to bail out the banks, but there are politicians calling for the Treasury minister’s resignation.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they have concluded a principle agreement on the rescue plan of the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to release the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more fit than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the focus on economic issues, Obama has regained some advantage again, while McCain’s advantage, gained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin’s vice president, has dispersed.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that Congress would swiftly pass the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps that have also been supported by him.
"Now we have to act responsibly ... danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn’t miss out on defining McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC that "all of us will be struggling to bring down this situation ... but doing nothing is not a viable path."
The Republican senator reported that the proposal includes the creation of a control committee of the minister of finance and the limitation of the good exits of top managers, things that he has been insisting on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a meritorious role in the deals, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self-aware - thus analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the left-wing German magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours his parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-Socialists have refurbished Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago was achievable: the undisputed hegemony of a party-state is over.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005 still in the period of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The reason for this is the modernization carried out in a consequent way in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists predicted this 40 years ago, but they made a lot of mistakes in their time, but secularization, educational achievements, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences for the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities, and the political consequences are obvious.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self-aware, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: freelancers, craftsmen, graduates and graduates.
Support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In the article "Party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" the Vienna-based conservative daily "Who with Who?" deals with Austria's confused domestic political situation following the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the involvement of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss a coalition.
Elections have been made, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate broadcast on public television the leaders of the parties have just shown the cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann has confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in social partnership already exists.
Faymann has left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP president, as deputy chancellor.
As he stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether your party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still an open thing in the party, issues should be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
BZÖ leader Jörg Haider has repeatedly been open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to take responsibility for governing," Haider said.
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, organised this year by France as the rotating EU Presidency, began today in Paris.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party Fidesz in the message addressed to the plenary as the main speaker of the congress drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladimír Ipidla, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz PE, recalled, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, that Roma are expelled from the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma do not have a middle-level degree and as a result of low-quality elementary education only a small number of them can achieve a higher degree."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in enforcing human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the member states of the European Union.
She believes that it is necessary to raise awareness among Roma and non-Roma in the wider context of these connections.
In fact, the sooner a Roma starts school, the greater their chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market; through taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the nation’s budget.
“The right of European citizenship of the Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools,” said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools and for this reason it is of fundamental importance that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly respected.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, we must give Roma children the opportunities granted by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens of the future of Europe," she asked.
In the spirit of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities organized every year since last year's Berlin meeting is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the ruthless Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat, the discussion of personal issues has not yet been postponed at the top of the Bavarian CSU.
Party president Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is as long as piety lasts.
The fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary congress of the party on the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have in any case made it known that they are not being attacked with all their might in the chair.
They have thus tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union achieved 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber they have fallen to 43.4%.
For 46 years, the CSU has been an “absolute monarch” in Bavaria, giving 18% of Germany’s GDP.
However, the conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, in the future they will be forced to coalesce anyway.
As a first sign of the reorganization within the party, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploratory group that will start negotiations with FDP liberals and Free Voters representing right-wing values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate on the list of Free Electors enters the legislature Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup opportunity by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman with great ambitions without regard.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also get an active role, as he has been plotting in the shadows so far. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU has called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made a few statements to the CSU that they deserved more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the national victory of 2005, is re-established with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is certainly related: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, the crisis of the Social Democrats is still going on.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not a single opposition representative entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's election.
According to Russian observers it is a sign of the well-being and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it is explained by the frauds committed in the count of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-person legislation of a country of 10 million inhabitants has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday’s elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (SDGs) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential term renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment in the 2006 elections held in debated circumstances, “granted” some representatives.
The SDG has thus renounced a previously-evaluated boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the Beltransgaz gas pipelines that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians can not enter for the anti-democratic Belarusian political situation considered.
He referred to a easing that the OSCE in assessing the election campaign had emphasized positive movements and not shortcomings, such as a ban on running for a third of the opposition candidates.
But the OSCE’s quick report also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this according to the opposition is perceptible an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms on paper a federal state, considers the two countries independent already a month ago.
"We have made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich told the newspaper.
According to the presidential candidate of the opposition in the 2006 elections, it is desirable that it remains despite the fact that “the power was afraid to bring even one opponent into a weightless parliament”.
The opposition does not provide for actions to protest the results, but rather tries to send the message to the voters of the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have a lot of problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that not even the officially most aided class, that of pensioners, considers adequate the Lukashenko regime that considers its main result the creation of social security.
Because of the country's debt and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time for the breakdown of social security "reminiscent of the sepulchral silence" - believes Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers judged the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "Men do not believe in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today this new measure against the cunning, against those who stamp and then go to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
The anti-fannulloni news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the General Secretary of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services," says the minister.
“A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
With Palazzo Chigi you complete the installation in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, the secretary general said: “It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all.”
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissants.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a beautiful cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand.”
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister said that “in three months the sick leave of public employees has decreased by 50%, that is 60,000 more people at work in a year”.
He added that public administration needs to be made more efficient.
In Italy, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants have joined to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is now flagging numbers about the least absenteeism at work due to illness, the people of 'working pranksters' are constantly growing.
There are thousands in Italy, in fact, the correct and productive employees of the public administration who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar will be challenged the exclusion of additional economic treatments for illness dependent on the cause of service; the extension of the time slots of the finding of the sick worker, within which checks are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur on the job, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, the Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday in October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic reports these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association of Persons with Mutilated and Disabled Persons of Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "strong appreciation for the constant associative commitment in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of the public".
"Of course, there has been an outraged 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but the daily reality proposes dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is attached to the many initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness by young people who are entering the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to delay in alarming about its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative rules.
For his part, the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "that the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes a firm commitment to all institutions aimed at urgently ending it".
“The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive,” said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
In fact, we would not want this “downward trend” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is relaxed that the tragedy explodes.
“We believe that too little is still being done at the general level to counteract the phenomenon of injuries, and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion, more checks and inspections are necessary, but also stronger intervention on the training of workers, starting from the world of school.
"More effort is needed - he added - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation protection provided for the victims of work" and the "assistential drift towards which the system is pushing in recent years".
"The goal is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the worker because the fate of those who are injured should not depend on spontaneousism or grant from time to time ordered by the legislator."
Mp3 players indicted, endangering hearing
Listening to loud music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a statement released in Brussels cites the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (CSRSERI), published today.
"From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day holding the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
“I’m concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-noise mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” Kuneva says.
“From the scientific findings, a clear risk emerges and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is that we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also re-examine the existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology.”
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they caused.
"Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what steps could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and related equipment."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
You can greatly limit this damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music equipment if they listen to loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours per week exceed the limits currently in force for the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany kicks off the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the “Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale”, which took place this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once closed in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bulletin" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - it wants to emphasize Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for an idea for the development of Rome of which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the City Council, can then be used.
There is no overlapping of roles but only the will to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then it will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise timeframe.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale".
To those who accuse the Commission of futility, since their opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be there, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and also as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
Too often politics overwhelms the management of daily life and the emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a coach: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Romanian citizens and it will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences that the Capital expresses".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immovable, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which it absolutely needs, thinking in a unified spirit about its future".
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the current municipal borders only, but will look far beyond" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital, but "also in consideration of the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. Here's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to pass as independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise just as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big face: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that has had two governors and five black senators in all!
In reality, these are attacks that don’t say much; they are attacks that are clearly racial in nature and don’t answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? Then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
There are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the southern United States wrote an editorial: “Once in the voting booth we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
It comes out one side of the American mindset kept covered up until the last.
“Say what you want, then we’ll figure out where to put the cross, whether it’s on Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, which almost certainly appears the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the butt.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush’s weak point.
Whoever takes George W’s place will have a huge task to do.
In the US, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cuts. And many blame the internet, "murderer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they once were.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
Also the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put together newspapers, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the general public understands it to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the national newspaper is on the wrong track.
In the local field, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses open a door to the internet, for many seen as the "murderer" of printed paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will “do something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between who runs the newsrooms – that is, the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
Fifty-six percent of executives nationwide are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23 percent.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who think of losing their jobs within 3 years are at 47% nationally.
For staff reporters it goes to 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it,” take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive high salaries, while the editor can also earn $10,000 a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to reach 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, often "get sick" during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: ROMA COURT, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS AT GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the application of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the Unipol-Bnl escalation counter pact.
During his trial last week, he obtained his release from the domiciles transformed into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the realtor could travel the route from the provincial town to a house in the capital.
According to the court, however, these moves (which the PM opposed) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence accusing him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the House vote against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
Yesterday’s New York Times confirmed this by informing us that the ongoing crisis is breaking up the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old, moderate East Coast soul, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new, conservative soul, hostile to “those of Washington” and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, by the way, which became arrogantly alive with the vow I was saying at the beginning.
But this just mentioned is only one example of the changes, of the great changes, which the current economic earthquake may foretell or already reveal: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not here alone.
Both in the US and in Europe, the crisis seems to act as an accelerator of long-incubated phenomena that in the new climate solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual state-sovereignty category in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that, yes, have close links with abroad, but that first of all involve the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems basically out of the question or does not have much to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union which is divided as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies fails to decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when it comes to tightness it is only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things right.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, which no market or international organization can possibly ever have in a similar measure.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that more recent developments in the economy tend to attach to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of the web, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will instead have to deal increasingly with those very immaterial things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look at it, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are still absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So those who find themselves to be sovereign, certainly possess several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, which, however, presages a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaders, especially economic ones, proved so inadequate and full of shadows.
And together, something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, a disgust, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
That is to say, there seems to be a growing belief in broad sectors of the population that before their actions are the same as the ideas of the social elites up until now, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall sense of the term, to have made their own time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and the traditional political arrangements, which manifests itself in the sudden electoral "revolts" or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of these last and last, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the American consensuses.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats, some would say, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape from today in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis invigorates, increases, potentially agitates.
In the face of all this, talking about a “rebellion of the masses” on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The superglue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutions has come very close to it.
With a sticker of just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to glue a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of those existing using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a spaghetti pile,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that manage to ensure a perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glazed paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time “is easily detached from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a research fellow at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could involve aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also researching a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented a microfiber-like adhesive that cleans itself of dust while moving on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are desiccating and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time with certain life-saving drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with taking certain medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia is launching a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple is enough to reduce the risk of some of the effects of absorptive drugs.
Grapefruit juice had already been charged because it was considered responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines to levels considered toxic.
DRUGS AT RISK - The Italian Medicine Agency itself reported this in a newsletter two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mix and to be careful what you drink in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
Not only PUMPELMO - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milan: "These findings are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not impress us but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification,” the expert pointed out to the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the most critical of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron failed, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on US history.
A prediction that sparked not a few controversy and that for years was backed up to the economist, but that has now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals like the Enron or Worldcom collapse disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a publicist with a “very aggressive style, particularly critical of the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism.”
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It’s the release day of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem watches, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several new features: the welcome screen and the revised interface and rendered less spartan, other more substantial ones are added such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format standard) version 1.2, the latest version.
Also note the interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some features specific to some forms are interesting, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for sending them by e-mail, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphics processing module, while retaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts about changes, in the word processor, each employee is assigned a color in the comments for better recognisability during the review.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to release the definitive result.
The English version is available for download at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be shipped home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a draw for the spread in homes, it is precisely in the business field that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no lack of realities that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding videowriting of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the Powerpoint emulator presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the databases; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also the fourth doping case.
New positive case at the last Tour de France: Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, third-placed and winner of the best climber jersey.
The news is reported on the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive rider at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place in the Tour and will meet the two years of canonical disqualification.
The head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the news of Kohl’s positivity to the third generation Epo and informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, also winning the jersey for best climber.
NEW YORK TIMES, ITALY IS RAZZIST?
Italy "has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed reluctantly.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time the ones where there is “more integration and more work” but also the “highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League”.
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism.”
Student victims of expensive rents up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students is not experiencing a crisis.
According to the latest investigation by Sunia, the tenant union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characters to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the office of studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the high demand from students has distorted the market so much that it triggers a process of generalized increase also for residents".
In most cases, the rental offers also contain a series of violations: free contracts, unregistered, without limit of fees, linked sub-rents.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of the tax, can calm prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, you need about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Stripe area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (Vitttoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 euros for a single bed.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (St. Lawrence, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in areas Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples for a bed you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari it takes 250/350 euros for a single bed, at least 350 euros for a single bed.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rentals to non-EU students is more frequent, such as in Perugia, there is finally a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee asked of foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, cities erase historic halls
The historic cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the large multisales and the consequent death by consumption of monosales in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem inescapable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
Disappearing are often historical and memory-filled places, "it's as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of the road and so many emotions," observes the director of Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won Tornator the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living perhaps the cinema.
The figures provided by the Anec, the main association of retailers, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the most important are the cinemas in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 single-room cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, it is precisely these three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” notes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, “it is useful that new structures are built but the survival of those already existing should be ensured, because when a city hall closes, not all its attendants are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund in favor of traders: the state’s previous debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, ethically and morally, that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros per year.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, decided to run for shelter with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-room cinemas both in the historic center and on the outskirts.
Among the rules provided for are tax relief measures in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking and some parking lots.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” notes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope other cities will follow Bologna’s example by setting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that to counteract the overpowering of multiplexes traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema di Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so many emotions shared, not to see the billboards blackened by the dust I turn to the other side.
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to align the choices of the Municipality with the interests of the Cosca Piromalli."
The accusations are heavy that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria address to the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in a mafia association.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his nephew's lawyer, the boss' namesake, already convicted of association for criminal mafia, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"In contempt of any legal and moral norm, as well as common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been thus granted to the cosca - the judges write - to enter officially within the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already large, of control and address of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusion between local authorities and organized malice there are several" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'Ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning follow those last July with which police announced that they had beheaded the Cosca Piromalli.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved but as early as 1991, and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, was elected head of a center-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called on the then deputy interior minister Marco Minniti, accusing him of having designed everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, explain that the cosca Piromalli had even asked for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the pm, it emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Pyromallians, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones are now on the field.
It’s an exterminated field, occupying over 70% of the planet’s surface and now the world’s major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now they try to get their hands, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the researches intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put aside, but now environmental demands and the new rise in oil give the industry momentum.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be met by offshore wave power plants.
That would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be tides and tides.
You're involved in the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later to bet on marine energy are more and more and among these companies always devoted to traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokeswoman for a U.S.-based oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is needed to start a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a sign, especially considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has started a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power are on the road to energy from the sea, and the amounts invested so far, though not known in detail, indicate rising interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants like the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, we must use technologies with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the buoys to move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four plants of this type being designed, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water when there are tides spins the turbine blades, creating a rotating motion that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Of particular interest, say the Institute for Electricity Research, is currently deserving of the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others on the coast, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and planned investments up to $35 million by 2009.
