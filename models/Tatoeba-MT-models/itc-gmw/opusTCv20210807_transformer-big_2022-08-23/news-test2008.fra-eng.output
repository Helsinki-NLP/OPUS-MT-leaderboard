Inflation in Europe has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, price increases in the 13 euro area countries were higher than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, the European Community statistics office in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate by saying that falling interest rates, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment rates, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: “we must deter” inflation so that we no longer have to intervene on this subject at a later date.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Cereal futures market ratings increased by 88 percent and the price of soybeans also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose 52 percent, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will go from 2.1 this year to 2.5 percent but, in 2009, it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, for the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the policy rate twice in 2008.
Gallup points to government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly in early December, so since 2002 it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never before seen such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of one-fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of the Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent across the entire population.
On the faithful voters certain to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered that the economic situation in the country was particularly serious has never been higher, it amounts to 41 percent and according to 46 percent supplementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects a worsening and only one-tenth expects an improvement.
Last December, 71 percent of respondents, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, felt the prime minister was doing his job badly rather than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or much confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent the president of Fidesz.
One indicator of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change in government.
While after the October riots, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, the current rate is only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 percent of respondents said they would definitely go to vote and the additional 20 percent said they would probably go to vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition fees in higher education, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 percent would say no to hospital fees.
When we look only at the same proportions of people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay fees, respectively.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets located in the Budaörs business triangle maintained last year’s average price increase of 16 percent, except that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a value increase of well over a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, which “already flew” in grocery stores last December, no longer jumped sharply from the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased significantly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by a minimum of 91 forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, however prices for turkey fillet, nut and poppy have risen sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed data from the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread of one kilo was found at 139 forints only.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints per bottle of Coca-Cola.
However, this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing last year’s most expensive basket and this year’s cheapest basket, we see a gap of 12 percent while the difference between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive one is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices rose by 1,206 forints on average, while the impact of the VAT rate increase was already noticed in last year's Christmas prices.
As a result of this process, hypermarkets were not able to determine clearly what margin to apply to products because they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, they risk losing a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the price increase in the Daily Basket has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints above the value of that of 2006 when the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and the least expensive prices increased by 1,284 forints as well.
As we approached the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday items increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some basic supplies, the statistics institute has seen price increases of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case for example of flour and egg.)
According to the daily basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, the flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than the egg suppliers because they have managed to accept the sudden increase in prices also by the multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
In our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the long-preserving food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed at the cash registers of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is lower in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer items.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
Not long ago, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected on a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident came out of the hospital but shortly after he had to return due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to do him a major operation because of the bacteria that is in his body.
As of 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multidrug-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Namely, this is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without it developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is well resistant to antibiotics that will quickly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as a traumatic infection or sepsis, on elderly patients, of small weights or with a weakened organism.
According to the managing doctor of the János hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
We must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only the one or we are not looking for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, caregivers wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are first checked for MRSA, but infection cannot always be prevented.
Sample collection is not fashionable
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favorable for preventing the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and seniors' homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and isolate patients with MRSA immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases only emerge if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient care and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks, but there are also significant gaps in hospitals in this area.
MRSA proliferates by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the contaminated patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of the epidemic, the patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, save on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is an exorbitant expense for social security funds, which is why this infection is being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens as a priority.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness
The official statement regarding the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was prepared.
It can be ruled out that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has since resigned from his post, who crushed a pedestrian causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, said Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the capital's Public Prosecutor's Office after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation that already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel
Last Tuesday, the former head of the police station of the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in Kossuth Lajos street of the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not going through the pedestrian crossing.
(Furthermore, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not an mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Code a car that initiates a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and requested his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident greatly upset him.
The investigation into this case is being conducted by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated early on with the magistrates charged with conducting the investigation.
Additional €400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed on Friday in Budapest three agreements worth a total of €400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of €300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, of which a credit agreement worth €100 million has already been signed by the parties.
The agreement on the EUR 150 million appropriation also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of €300 million for Hungary, with the remaining €150 million to be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project of metro line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-discuss the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary finalised the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and no commitment fee.
Bulgaria, paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned towards this Balkan country little mentioned in the past.
What, or and who bought on this EU market which is always the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sunshine Coast", the old Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik area as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also increasingly buying in the very inexpensive corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, with commercial and office surfaces promising the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy a building in Bulgaria are at the same time looking to change their life, their lifestyle.
Most of the buyers are English but others are coming from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea shore and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle in buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium- to long-term capital gains.
The price of buildings in the capital continues to rise as demand grows.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals end on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define the efforts to be made after the emissions reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there are lively discussions on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, at the moment, it does not want to discuss exact figures, while it was ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed, excluding emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement has also been signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors likely under the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) said.
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU’s ambition to retain its role as a flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the signing of the “Post-2012 Agreement”, and was ready to reduce them by up to 30 percent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had aimed at a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that time took the commitment on 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments of reduction below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emission reductions, the need for which has been emphasized in the new IPCC report.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees celcius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British Army units are posting footage from its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video-sharing site with the aim of becoming popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that became passionate about YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan upload video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC said.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the air force operations headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London where compatriots upload them to the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 footage on the net this way and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as the "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and is releasing videos about operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the Ministry of Defence, the videos were also used to make the general public aware of the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs practically nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements passed on television, Gordon Mackenzie, a defense consultant, communicated to the BBC. On the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the merits of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game.
The army is annoyed because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the deaths of soldiers: in the “official”, somewhat hypocritical propaganda films, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
Moreover, many videos had already gone online showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out in real mission, but the British army has only recently rushed to upload these videos.
Americans recruit a bit differently using the free-to-download America's Army shooting game, where the player can put himself directly in the shoes of the soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and donuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, the Labour Minister, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 with donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is fun.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year’s biggest Christmas party will be hosted by the Ministry of Defence, but it will not be invited by the Ministry’s employees.
At Christmas, Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also be held.
The ministry plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
In comparison with the other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred employees overall, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
During this holiday, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas has cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room costs one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, an NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, the tendering company.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to reach the person in charge.
Costume is not mandatory
The ILO building was not only home to the NFÜ but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, held a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
The ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the minister's welcome and dinner was followed by a dance party on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: Evening dress was not at all obligatory at this ball.
Ministries of health, labour and local communities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will hold a show and party for its employees, within its walls, for 400,000 Forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her collaborators to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and eat doughnuts, the press service said, the party will cost as much as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his employees to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will host a Christmas party in its large hall at which 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
There is no planned party atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized annually, are started with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services have informed [origo].
The Ministry of the Environment's press service did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than 400 people were invited to the festivity held at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega-strike are gathering
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will set up their strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the health fund law, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams as rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The unions of the league will announce, Friday afternoon, the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a protest general assembly will be held and, starting Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop working indefinitely if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, starting from the day of the vote in parliament on the health fund law, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Funds Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on what to do next.
According to Monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Funds Act will only take place late in the evening, or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic jams are planned: railways will stop work for an indefinite period of time and during the morning part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are at risk of being arrested.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strikes, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report going on strike indefinitely, others have declared a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ) failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but as Christmas approaches, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will go on strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., the Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will go on strike for four hours, the Union of Teachers and the Democratic Union of Teachers called for strikes respectively for 2 hours and from 2 hours to 8 hours.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country in alternation, the Health and Social Employees Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires that the government withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be implemented from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third demand is for a guarantee of retirement before the legal age, which would allow the system to pass the functions it deserves before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the secondary railway lines and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increased the country's risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases the political risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
In its “risk warning”, the company notes that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur following the aggravation of the ethnic tension already existing between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of the Hungarian political actors: “public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma affair to representatives of radical and extreme political groups that have based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians”.
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, due to the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard “significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country”.
They recall that, following the increased publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right-wing groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, giving themselves the name of "national association of self-defense".
“The common feature of these rallies is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their adherents for defense missions (disasters, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary, moreover, referring to the inadequacy of the police, the army, in other words the state,” they added.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method that, based on the rancor of the political society and the parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions in a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civility and association status is therefore only intended to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering these associations in court, but it is also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk, and ultranationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma unrest that broke out in a neighborhood in Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) led to the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
In taking advantage of these events, UNB decided to set up a guard by saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
According to them, in the last 17 years, gypsies have “terrorized” Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the establishment of their own guards as resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not rule out that Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, says the risk warning of Political Capital.
Asked for information from the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said: "Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could impact the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
The days of rest are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the wake-up callers can rest quietly.
In one year, we have eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as well as October 23, which is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1st is Labor Day and on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased family members and friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, at Pentecost and at Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, depending on the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and their employees, to public servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not apply, however, to service societies, institutions that operate continuously and in service, by their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because according to experience, the majority of people do overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes in order to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be fewer changes in the level of working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home for four days in a row.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday 2 May.
Another change is planned for October 23rd: Saturday, October 18th will be a working day replacing Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year’s Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can terribly annoy colleagues
Emails we forget to send, voicemails we never receive, innocent lies that almost annoy us more: these are things that “beautify” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these problems or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you you were called from the marketing department,” a colleague told you.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, this is arranged with an apology.
Before you have any painful explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can’t find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague’s desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking or they're right to be angry at you for pricking their good.
Do not bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and that you need them right away.
Do you talk about the privacy of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop gossip spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (assumptions) about your colleagues’ privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don’t abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information in yourself and don’t discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
You say you're sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under the guise of a tearing headache because you feel bad or feel you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your future missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don’t get in trouble with your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won’t go to work or that something may happen that would force you to stay at home, don’t forget to notify your boss and colleagues to avoid them being surprised by your absence the next day.
Fluttering, snarling, phone
You get into your job, but your co-workers' sneering takes you out of it?
Have you unintentionally become a witness to a phone conversation that you better not listen to?
Don’t bother your co-workers with humming, chanting, loud arguments (which you’re conducting above their heads), kicking, heavy words, or loudly voiced discontent.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Do you accuse others of a fault?
If your work is not done within the deadline, you forget to send an important mail or message, do not accuse anyone for this forgetting!
Don’t put it on account of the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you made a mistake and if it presented inconvenience to others, fix the fault!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix the negligence!
Do you feel at home in the office?
Putting on a jog and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don’t be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet your expectations, you are no longer interesting.
We move slowly into the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'll turn on the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of the moment, then a female choir joins it like a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
Now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground are gradually beginning to change the overall picture and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and played himself in Yonderboi's group before he set out on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alliance of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török.
Formation playing in small clubs at first began to be known by a wider audience when wan2 magazine cited their 2002 debut album as one of the fifty most important records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would be as competitive in the West.
Zagar and his ensemble became undeniably “trendy” but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted well, they released a new and better record.
The recently released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new avenues for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the old group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are doing well with the reference to flying but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the album's premiere at the Millennial Park.
On the album, there is a real hit for the radio, Mr.2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: did your music really remain music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer doesn’t tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop music but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
A good pop song can be honest too.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either one more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
La, people go to concerts and not only the young of ten or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I’m obviously glad to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal, but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important at concerts or mutual influence already works but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
However, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you would no longer be interesting.
hvg.hu: Do you plan to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and has made a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow its path even though sometimes some people try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
In the beginning, it was certainly inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because many of us are leaving his band and taking a different path.
hvg.hu: On Mr. Petõfi's chart, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many have heard Zagar’s name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style have you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t plan to make a tube to be able to sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes covered throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later christened Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we wrote the album, we thought that there was still something missing from this song.
The string of chords drew the voice of the song.
I sang the same melody the girls learned later that night.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that galvanized me at the time but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a short solo by Judy Jay), they do not have a solo role, they all sing together and they do not sing louder than the music, so the music does not only accompany their singing.
They were behind the scene as well.
Is it wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only due to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget a little bit about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none about the music creation process, we had more difficult songs when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything got set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already “released” this record.
They are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth, and Never The Same.
The treacherous trader risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A disguised fraudster.
This is the name of its former employee, the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerní banka.
The bank lost almost five billion euros because of him.
But it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, can not be considered incapacitated.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis of the American mortgage market in time.
"He's fragile," said his superiors, who reported him to police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel’s testimony reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the man’s transactions produced at the end of last year a profit amounting to 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis overtakes the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called “sub-prime” mortgages, granted to low-income customers or those who had encountered repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
“As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel said, adding that he had, of course, kept nothing for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed to having falsified the reports so as not to be detected.
He managed to deceive his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything does nothing.
Was he afraid of being discovered?
Pretty much not.
"I thought that just getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to risk so much come from?
He only came to his post gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trade assistant and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew he would never win as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
In terms of my academic background and my professional and personal background," Kerviel told investigators.
Shortly after taking office, he achieved his first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone.
“It was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
“As long as I was winning, they were pretending to close their eyes.”
This is where the start of the year comes in.
He loses a billion dollars in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer a bank employee.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became suspicious because of his leave.
“Last year, I took only 4 days off.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to another,” Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech kronor) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion kronor from seven operational programmes will go to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately 100 billion kronor under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit the most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion kronor next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new, more effective management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic was among the new members among the beneficiaries of the least successful EU funds.
Court upholds 20 years in prison for former Nicaraguan president
Nicaragua's Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld a 20-year prison sentence for the country's former president Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million (nearly RON 1.8 billion) fraud.
However, he was later released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will or will not be incarcerated again is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or he will go to prison again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictitious corporations and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and closest supporters.
Some of that money went into the funds Alemán had created to fund his 2001 election campaign.
The budget has been adopted
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
Why is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ?SSD, since it was the minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ?SSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the hectic debate that preceded the vote on the declaration of distrust to the government, nothing dramatic this time around.
The House of Representatives passed this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and the end of every government.
The budget is part of politics, though hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
Politicians’ disputes are of much more interest to opinion than the steep numbers.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three ills that the current budget is not able to settle at the same time:
The first is the large part given to the costs of mandates imposed by the law, constituted not only by pensions, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the parties SSD and KSOM.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, that is, the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued dizzy bonds, excessively indebting their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In past years, they were able to repay these debts by selling en masse the shares of the distribution systems, especially those of energy, obtained from the state in the context of privatizations.
They no longer have that source.
If we stick only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years now, just like the rest of the world, and we have a lot to do with it.
This was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable manner than our republic.
This is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are among the countries that are globally least threatened by poverty.
So we do not need massive social programmes that have unfortunately been unnecessarily swollen in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the election has been eliminated, if a retirement age gap and pension reform do not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever will be in power will only administer.
Barely exaggerating, we can say that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes regular fees to be pushed back by mandate fees.
The $70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not squandered all the money they could.
If we really don't want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it manages to levy in taxes and taxes, the calm needed to prepare new laws for reform.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.
Ji? Krej?
Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be placed in the money markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction $40 billion and, in addition, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of individual states have decided to take such concerted action to prevent or even mitigate the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to clients.
“Central bank concerted action has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion from unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still expecting losses in billions.
“If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is that they have to really understand what can still happen,” says ABN Chief Economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he adds.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after they failed to bring down London’s interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks still feared mutual borrowing, even though the U.S., Canadian and British central banks had repeatedly lowered their interest rates during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further fall in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank approach will help to stem the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
President Klaus: the debates of the ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be especially damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has again spoken on the issue of global warming.
Criticism this time came over the UN international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, constituted by a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanying rhetoric and the reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a rocket of words, ersatz of solutions to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed during the presentation of his book that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
Now interested persons can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless has, in his opinion, enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic able to follow and appreciate scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, the changes of it are therefore normal, there is not an opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too serious, therefore they represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence the evolution of the climate are ineffective and ineffective.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against “reasonable environmental protection, but against fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring.”
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this at the Hayek Institute two months ago.
600,000 people failed to renew their driver’s license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driver's license whose validity expires at the end of the year.
This is the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so the authorities are in a position to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid license will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driver’s license especially those who no longer wish to drive.
As municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are overwhelmed with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has been growing this week.
The City Council satisfies about 2000 customers a day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for release within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an extra five hundred kronor.
Drivers who fail to carry out the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will take the road without a valid licence, will be at risk of a fine as early as January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence through an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 kronor.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
In doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 kronor.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1,000 kronor.
However, according to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, in his opinion, a document that people can decide whether or not they want to have.
It is not like the identity card that must be valid without exception.
Those who no longer wish to drive should give up their driver’s license.
Simply bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driver's licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Individuals with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to renew.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the sentences of the detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko?a?k, former police officers accused of colluding with David Berdych’s gang, will serve 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The High Court in Prague thus definitively sentenced them by reducing their sentences by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Initially, detectives in the Department for Combating Organized Crime were at risk of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, only an appeal to the Superior Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently awaiting the trial verdict.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials that exceed 16 years in prison.
He can receive no more.
In January, the Departmental Court found 19 people guilty of participating in hold-ups, with the Superior Court now handling the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants had questioned the prosecution since the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it was a manipulative case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, members of the police, after an agreement with Berdych among others, transmitted information from police sources to the criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped members of the gang avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang returned 30 percent of the larceny to Opava and Kosak.
The indictment mentions the gang's criminal activity from 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robberies whose victims have, in most cases, suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited armaments.
During house searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, shells with a steel core, a sight for laser direct firing or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of others guilty of other robberies.
Other men from the Berdych neighborhood are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing avoided, for the time being, Tom? P?ta and Mar? ?lej, who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision regarding their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
The lawyer of the families Igor Veleba wants to get compensation of 12 million crowns from the hospital of T?ebí? plus the expenses.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why the lawyer of the Ondcej Dostál hospital absolutely does not agree with Veleba's proposal.
“We reject such a claim, it is very very high,” Dostál said after the hearing.
“To be able to make an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party commissioned.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands,” Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 kr for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablonov’s family asked for a million crowns for each month when she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Center in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better endured by men, although they were faced with the remorse of not being able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, however, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening precisely at the moment, the Veleba report summarized.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in T?ebí? on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the ?ermák in P?ibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Bro? and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablo?ov.
At the end of October, the governor of the region, Vysoina Milo? Vystr?il, gave each of the families 100,000 kroner for the reimbursement of the expenses caused by the error of the hospital of T?ebí? managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally obliged to provide liability insurance.
In case of non-compliance, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
Until now, the courts recognized relatively low compensations, the amounts calculated according to the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valasské Království (the Kingdom of Valassko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand Valașské kralovství (Kingdom of Valașsko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it was indeed he who first used the title King of Valasko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomás Harabis, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabic and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valasko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabi is of the same opinion.
“There’s a job that’s been behind us for almost 10 years.
Searching for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, it is money that is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project is successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize on our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title valasská král (King of Valassko) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohat? had crowned him king in 1993.
But at the time, it had nothing to do with the project of setting up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabis came up with the idea of publishing passports for the Valasské Království.
From a humorous action originally came a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabic, of the company Valaské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature be mentioned in the passport and even offered the holders of the sales on the price of the visit of his farm and his theatre shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi has only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the show Mané, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the project Valasské kralovství," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabic and his team, who were intensely dedicated to the project.
The collaboration between the parties now enemies continued until 2000 when Harabis organized for Polivka an official coronation in Vsetin.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabic, which culminated with the deposition of "King Boleslav the 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabis, assumed by the singer Jarmila Uláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabic and his company, which the court today rejected.
What could clear the case is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half of the princess.
There should be a new king.
He did not want to betray the details and the date.
“We don’t want to go fast in business.
It would be something like the parade of the kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register,” added Harabis.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearance of prejudices
I’ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its bearing qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, of the driving and also that of the manufacture could, in many ways, be described as inferior to the average.
However, currently there is on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which, it, is significantly better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes one step further, all I have to do is think about it better.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I was complaining, for example, about headroom in the rear seats.
While there ends the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will, in this regard, be comfortable.
Let's see quickly done
I'll talk about the inside very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that I think is poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about too short seats or files is over.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the body is also noticeable there.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the head already mentioned disappear.
A trunk in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this as very accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting ice) and with a rather easy grip.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be stretched while being able to hold fairly heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is compared to the competition a rather average figure.
Apart from the Skoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, we find that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or charging a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to point out the advantages, I would mention the underside of the case remaining after the backrests of the rear seats are rolled over perfectly straight, or else a very low step.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to be honest, that’s what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback walk.
It is quiet, consumes little and, most importantly, grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Skoda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust jar blocked by a wiper, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1.4-litre Otto engine amounting to 329,900 kilowatts is still affordable.
The vehicle that we tested costs from 410,900 kPa, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 K'.
In addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs at the end of the count 531,900 K?.
That’s a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to the price of the Fabia and you will get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is bad
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern among the rest of the population about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of Northern Kent, where the conflicts between Slovak immigrants and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicane and fights between students transposed into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who struck a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy insulted her with racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly addressed the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
“When we got home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remaining members went so far as to describe conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above testify that the atmosphere in British schools between the original inhabitants and the immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can be accomplished if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and the all inclusive with waiters offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will find this list not only in its entirety, but enriched.
Now, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
In the days of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the storehouse and place of transshipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, built it, since everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he owned his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your own autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, we will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still drive in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats once imported have already long ago, in such a salty and humid, rotten climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is noticeably decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Given that tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
During the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín Province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the plantations extended into the candy shops on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how you can see walking small locomotives whose contemporaries are not elsewhere only in museums.
Where do you direct your steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
There is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that anyone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viçales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows on limestone soil.
Mogotes, limestone balloons and rocks rise in candlelight from the bottom of the valley, and as fertile land has been caught in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetal carpet.
The valley is probably the place where Cuban tobacco of the best quality is grown.
You will be able to meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
Perhaps someone will also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth has been embodied in the beauty and city-window character of this small town.
Coloniální ?pan?lská arquitetektura,v?razn? ovlivn?ná pozd?j?mi francouzsk?mi osadníky, is already ?ty?i steleti tem? nezm?nila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountainous Escambray massif, is a place so far apart that even in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stand aside.
We weren’t building anything, and that’s why we weren’t demolishing anything either, everyone was just having a roof over their head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is also worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after sunset and where the music only settles in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some people refer to this town in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without traces of human activity.
UNESCO has placed Cuba’s East Snake, thanks to its untouched landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was born about one hundred years after the Columbus journey) and from the hill where the old castle and the current El Castillo hotel is held, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestra mountain range, Sows Bay and Isla de Pinos Island, Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a number of pages.
Only, as they say, it is better to see once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, say the Americans
The lack of troops and necessary equipment influences, according to the United States, the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Minister Robert Gates said NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and allied coordination.
While the United States this week called NATO troops to greater activity through Defense Minister Robert Gates, Britain sees strengthening Afghan government authority and intensifying development aid as a priority.
“The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is, according to US military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent from last year, to 60 percent in Helmand province, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Concretely, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
“We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts among the countries involved over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their utmost.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called the German soldiers lazy this week.
“The lazy Afghans discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight,” Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild counterattacked by publishing a photo of a British troupe at a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State Debt Will Rise to One Billion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 kronor falls on each Czech.
Total debt rose to RON 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kronor this year.
Thanks to better-than-expected savings in the state budget, the ministry reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion kronor.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion kronor.
During the nine months of this year it therefore increased by 40.2 billion kronor.
However, as of June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion kronor.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the state debt dating back to early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 kronor falls on each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has been indebted by more than RON 111 billion.
"For now, it appears that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could exceed the 1 trillion kronor limit only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and 1 trillion kroner,” Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor’s forecast is similar: “We could exceed one trillion over the course of 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I’m not waiting for that change,” he said.
Debts are growing
The debt of the state is constituted by the debts of the central government and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
Government debt is financed by treasury bonds, pension securities, direct loans or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt has risen this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kronor.
The state’s external debt has risen this year from 1.7 billion kronor to 123.3 billion kronor.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached 803.3 billion kronor at the end of September and from the month of June it decreased by 13.7 billion kronor.
The average government debt payable was 6.5 years.
“Total debt grew year-on-year from the first to the third half of the year by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a far too high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by the rent securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be something to negotiate when the pension reform comes,” commented the Pikora data.
Better than expected
This follows the 2007 government debt financing and management strategy that the government had planned to borrow C$159.2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to better-than-expected savings in the state budget, the ministry reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion kronor.
The sum is essentially the deficit of the state budget, which is clearly going to reach 76 billion kronor this year, instead of the 91.3 billion kronor initially planned.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion kroner, the 10 billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of 43 billion kroner of government bonds and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion kroner.
She was appearing in court today in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
She was accused of letting students between the ages of 6 and 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any depiction of the Prophet of Islam is unlawful.
She was punishable by a whiplash.
The 54-year-old British teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with assaulting Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favorite first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the caption “My name is Mohamed”.
The bear itself had no label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name,” which he said was an “innocent mistake.”
A view shared by many of the teacher’s students who describe her as “very caring towards her students” and “never talking about religion in the classroom.”
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given first name in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians concluded a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without having been able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger told a news conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake,” his U.S. counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to abide by their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
“We don’t expect violence in the immediate future, but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiating session since the troika was tasked with further mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," said the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where the "last chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.”
"Domino Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said it feared a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the 1990s wars of independence.
“For Serbia, that doesn’t mean a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be taken exclusively at the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the final say"
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status,” adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking people would be made “in consultation” with the West.
Bush scraps deal between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised he would do everything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the “road map” for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim “to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues.”
This name covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “global and thorough” and deal with all aspects of a settlement, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others.”
In turn, Olmert pledged to make the talks "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing his Palestinian and Israeli “two-state vision” that coexists.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment to this from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview with the Saudi-funded Arab daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this type of fact various, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was traveling at 40-50 km / h, without gyrolight,” a police source said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, “unapproved, so not allowed to drive on the public road” (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was driving “very fast”.
“She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right,” a police officer said.
The blood alcohol control performed on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before crashed, starry windshield, bumper torn off) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "acts of involuntary homicide and non-assistance to anyone in danger" to the IGPN, a cosisie with the departmental directorate of public safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation at this stage excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the police officers, namely that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the feet on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled for as long as the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police officers would have left the place very quickly, thus not lending help to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out “any serious misconduct” on this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, which we must be very careful about," a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness of those few moments after the accident.
One of his windows overlooking the scene.
“We immediately went downstairs, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them,” said the witness.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely haggard policeman, who was wailing.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone.
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that the people present had the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen were taken by car by colleagues who arrived on the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived “about twenty minutes after the policemen left.”
They also practiced heart massages in vain.
“I will not let it be said that the police did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
“Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was instituted two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
They fired stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other protests reportedly took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday garnered support from religious parties in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “urged the population to send flowers to judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and debris to those who took the oath before Musharraf.”
“Musharraf’s promise no longer holds.”
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly targeted by the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
It was expected to decide in the coming days on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf on October 6 by indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a "no-hold" civilian president after the state of emergency was established, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
That he would abandon his military uniform was expected by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied the country’s insistent rumors that President Musharraf has been under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unpredictable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or infertility still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, the Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception has led to a better “control of fertility”, according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated monthly for one in five couples and if possible in the spring, considered the most enjoyable season to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "baked" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem emerged on Tuesday as astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical piece to soon host the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of docking dock for the laboratory modules.
But you need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was therefore to move a 17.5-ton solar panel power generation module, already on the ISS, to position it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the module's solar panels which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And this is where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged over almost a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally to perform a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go snailing at the end of the 30 meters long remote arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, durable, very skilful, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, the trained doctor was tasked with “operating” the “injured” solar panel.
After accurately inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and installed some sort of "slings" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the sas and, from the inside, by the other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew's commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped in insulation to prevent electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and “do-it-yourself” by the astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying his tools and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were enjoying a half day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts are returning to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS Securities sanctioned on the stock exchange
EADS stock is currently down sharply on the Paris stock exchange, after the aerospace and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS is currently losing 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast due to delays due to the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to offset the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion euros for Airbus", said the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further quantification.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operating income of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges related to the delays of another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense at the exit of the ballot box on Sunday: the Russians will choose massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a television message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the head of the United Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is expected to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not reveal anything by receiving foreign ambassadors, content to deliver a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want fair, transparent and open elections, smooth elections,” he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
She denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Zyuganov said that “never before have there been such dirty elections, even in the time of Yeltsin.”
After the crackdown on protests last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
“The Russians have kept the Soviet homo mentality.”
Behind these suspenseless legislatures lie two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
No successor is emerging.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
Either way, in the legislature or in the presidential election, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the Soviet homo mentality, they do not feel mastery of their destiny,” says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society has lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians “willingly renounce personal responsibility” which they had briefly shown after the breakup of the USSR.
“What’s the point of thinking?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
People prefer stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old teacher, said: “What good is it to think about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Bad Arolsen Nazi archives, which trace the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are openly accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen (Hessen), were hitherto only available for “humanitarian” purposes, that is to say individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or of his rightholders.
The eleven states in charge of their management – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been in effect since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will allow for research “in particular on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of the forced labourers,” explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, objected to the openness to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
Last April, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s 9th largest trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free trade pact greatly affects both economies” and “India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” Mandelson said.
Europe is the first or second diplomatic market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner José Durazo. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, regretting that the bilateral trade of the President of the European Union still reaches its potential.

Bank of England Takes Note of Concerns by Offering 10 Billion Pounds Over Five Weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was concerned about easing the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
“To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve supply during the maintenance period beginning on December 6 in the form of an open market transaction in five weeks.”
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE has put five-week cash on the market in an open market transaction.
These are normally done within a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it “stands ready to take further steps to maintain the rates” of day-to-day interbank loans in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, a high since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put on the market by the Bank of England were accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from using them.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to consider PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text rejected a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the national office of the PS including the increase of 50% of the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the framing of rents.
With UMP and NC voting against the review of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was adjourned following the general discussion that resulted in sometimes lively exchanges between the majority and opposition within hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending Finance Bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is expected to be held August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the lead at the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” Jones said.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
“Unfortunately, we’ve gotten stuck in politics because of the current administration,” says Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8 million and $11.3 million respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are instead held in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both the impression of a country festival to the European and urban to the American one."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the holding of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says they are "interesting enough to allow us to invest in such an event and host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s capacity is “very large,” like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said invitations were issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of press.
“Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, in hopes of attracting all sorts of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter of the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie sets to Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate functions.
A warrant - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the “Governator”?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds that conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best,” he says.
The race to the festivals
At the moment, however, Denis Turcotte’s priority is the promotion of cinema here.
The race for the Oscars has begun.
It will be all West Side festivals, be it Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present the Quebec films, highlight them and ensure that the directors do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil will be performing at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in hopes of the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year’s experts are not as certain as this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "statistically, the month of December on the stock exchange generally behaves positively.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, since, given the current context, uncertainties are lurking in the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not proponents of the stock market gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is fed by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight towards quality values both in the long periods and in the short."
For this, they believe the stock exchange will behave rather laterally, not free of volatility “especially because we do not know the impact of the Fed’s likely rate drop, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions.”
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
“It’s not the best thing,” the expert says.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during those dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the feast of the Constitution (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound in the index that could be provoked based on the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex towards new maximum quotas.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco said the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get into it.
"ACS has been recovering for several months and we hope that other manufacturers like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," he said.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do it very well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, December has only been a bearish month on two occasions.
The authentic year-end rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the burgeoning technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in computer on its year-end rally.
Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8.30pm, and to open on Saturdays from 10am to 8.30pm.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to reach an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his agencies on Saturday instead of opening one afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of Banque Populaire will be decisive for other organizations to join or not to join this initiative that coincides with the business hours.
This is precisely what the Bank is looking for.
Attracting self-driving customers who travel in these areas to shop in SMEs and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since this is not the opening of new branches but a renovation of the existing ones.
To do this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The bank's commercial manager, Ángel Rivera, says the renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and apparently with success, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which open even on Sundays and holidays.
In these agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' Rivero notes.
For now, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a managing director of Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction, at the close of the stock market, when he found that the channel he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect tarnished his joy: “What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more, but that we have decreased less,” he said.
However, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66% over the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (an additional 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Rival Antena 3, which ceded 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a decline of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other publicly traded communications companies is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that ' we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured by Giuseppe Tingali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
For this announced figure to be real, the TV channel is expected to register a 3.6 per cent increase in its advertising billing for the current year compared to $965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, Antenne 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million), while net television revenue increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the significant payout that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after buying 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have an official compromise to give for a minimum of 50 percent, although we have always said a lot more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already given shares with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its earnings estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company lowered the Antenna 3 earnings forecast to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities recommends buying both securities based primarily on its significant dividend profitability and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
La Caja Madrid sees Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antenna 3 (maintain) for the ' multiple attractions ' and the increase in business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends that both cases be examined since it has had ' similar threats ' (a saturated market and a poor economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which came into force on November 1
Alongside its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congressional vote on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members of Parliament and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies for the efficient functioning of the markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, at a time when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial advisory services to both specialized corporate and legal entities and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (FIAs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services firms to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms on the market and to keep a record of all transactions they conduct, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
Through the Congressional Economic Commission, several changes have been added, including one that highlights that securitised debts will be considered a “complex” financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proven itself with what happened with the debt of high-risk U.S. mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the management's transposition to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics may have 30 years after, in 1977, was approved, the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company that will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting new clients to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increases by five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14.
“The CPI will continue at relatively high levels.”
Second Vice-President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the 4.1% increase in CPI in November was a “time figure,” but at the same time he predicted the price index would continue at “relatively high” levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes said in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain about the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were expecting a figure around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged from the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover 42,000 million euros over three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen by more than 50 percent to 12,000 million pounds since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At the time, he was amassing record deposits of over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that gradually fell in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government offered and that he will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rebrand the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenue of the UK banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get the remaining 18,000 million pounds until the target of 30,000 million is reached.
The tycoon group Richard Branson, known for its advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin association, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
Totana Mayor Arrested for Alleged Urban Corruption
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian town of Totana (People's Party) early this morning because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
AIn addition, one of the municipal council's secretaries and the municipal police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me last May Juan Morales, current deputy of the right, and until then municipal councillor of the town hall, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the Channel SER, could be the 'leader' of this frame.
Officers continue to search the municipal and city council premises and there is no denying the possibility of further stoppages in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As Chaîne SER indicated yesterday to the lawyer of the 'people's party's' deputy Juan Morales, he was arrested as he left Morales' home with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to chair Congress if they win the election
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus the organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, who on November 15 made public his decision not to run in the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in academia.
The former minister acknowledged that the president of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
Moreover, he noted that even though citizens already know who will be the economic vice president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he gets the job, Bono hopes to turn the House into “a house of respect and not insult or screaming” and make it “more and more like the citizens.”
“Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only venue in Madrid where we cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on certain occasions has been interrupted 26 times.”
In the same way, he had praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he already occupied his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents might consider "a domination".
A climate propaganda
Given that the climate change movement is mercilessly persecuting both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach forces him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain leading the European Union in the non-execution of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who was responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it occurred and why his Government, the Government of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences will this cause.
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the actual measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to a hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him lecturally so dangerous in Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes the meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and that it does not claim that we move on a bicycle or refresh ourselves with the range.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested on alleged urban corruption plot
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, the sources of the investigation said today.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where at the moment many agents met, who also presented themselves to the function of municipal councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal enterprise of management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six arrests made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which Totana Court No. 1 is investigating.
The first six detainees have now been transferred to court.
According to the sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently the autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the target of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former city councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor from Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Inmonuar, the Nuaria Group agency, through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is carried out by the Gendarmerie’s Urban Offences Unit (UCO), whose agents, in addition to arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a poultry business well known in the area, which may have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that have been requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the car parks in Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and in the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (certainly PISA news headlines above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that it appeared there, curiously, the critique of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course has called public opinion into question as a consequence of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the dead, a graduate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Councillor for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat daily and he asserted that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague gives information about the introduction of crimes in the Criminal Code on downloads on the Internet:
A. The downloading of a song would be a crime punishable by a sentence of six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a store of CDs for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store with a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (section 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a three-month to one-year sentence (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a six-month to two-year sentence
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, under article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without author’s permission is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real world, then someone is exaggerating.

My attending physician told me about one of his articles on strange research titled, ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less’.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers observed that when both people guessed that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them was receiving the double, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if that would require so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the prosecution office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list which the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's list' (2006, not screened exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who prosecutes the fugitive criminals and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible claims, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, driver's license seniority, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the right model.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is embodied in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the award and in return becomes liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the odds to pay.
For this reason, people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower claim rate than their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must carefully study the situation to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will explain the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face a variety of disadvantages when entering into an insurance contract at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and driver's license seniority.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is to insure at all risks, other, more economical options exist.
The more forward-thinking drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with deductibles, so that they get insurance coverage at all-risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
“The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be determined based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount,” Luis Noguera, the head in Spain of First Europa, online insurance mediator, said in a statement.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
One piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be cautious and avoid claims as much as possible, since this will have an impact on the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic fare that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
“Bonus and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses,” Noguera explains.
Beyond the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers to enter into an insurance contract, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is best to choose all-risk insurance with deductible.
"Normally young people can not take advantage of the experience previously acquired after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risks, as long as his economic situation allows it.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest claims rate, because the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance at any risk with deductible (may be 300 euros), or an extended third party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have more casual driving and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises," Noguera said.
For pensioners, insurance at any risk with deductible is preferable (being this one of 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is fundamental to study properly the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the final eighth
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow meet next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the missing point to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D games will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as AC Milan are due to play in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final on December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most anticipated result, although the two teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better crossing in the final eighths.
A loss from Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but she will not be able to computer on that alone since with nine points the game returns to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hopes of qualifying for the eighth final for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the Rossoneri, the triumph would only come back to Shakhtar, in case Celtic loses, to qualify for the final eighths in order to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And that is that Benfica, although it is last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the band's reunion was "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people sold out the tickets to attend the concert which was the subject of a video in which is told the story of the band that raged in the late 1990s.
The meeting and world tour coincided with the release of a new album that resumed their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI released in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had given them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience filling the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
' Sporty Spice' who joined the band in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the band to break up two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that people’s feelings changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “things have come together and we appreciate each other very much.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl last showed up in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of baby sitters was waiting for them.
She has five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5-7).
They will be exhibiting in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is raising alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas ferments between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are convoyed by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia’s monopoly company supplying the gas, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would raise its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would mean for Ukraine, a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during conversations, remembering that we are a country through which most gas transits,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be related to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006 the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine.
This caused exports to Western Europe to fall, resulting in higher prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Union nations in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health “must control its foreign employees.”
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve controls on its extra-community employees to see if they have any criminal record, the control committee said.
Reviewer General Robert Black's warning came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health does not have any specific data on the number of overseas people it employs.
However, his report highlighted other decisive checks, correctly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General did checks on extra-community personnel following the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing with his jeep into the gates of the main terminal.
He was among three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October on suspicion of being involved in various car bombing attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out background checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Criminal Record Control, thus allowing employers to undertake controls on various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time," the report said.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health performs most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: “Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information about some overseas staff is available to health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said the report "suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value."
The Scottish health authorities said they employed 1,161 people from overseas, most of whom were doctors and nurses.
But the reviewer-general stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, in part because of problems in identifying staff with an indefinite contract, who might or might not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current inspection procedures of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently revising its policy and pre-employment control system for staff in the overseas health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was excited to do this work in the aftermath of the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.”
She added that the Scottish Government allied with the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be released next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, which are valid for all employees, including people overseas.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio peak on Joy Division’s latest singer, Ian Curts, won five awards, including best film, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was cast as Curtis in this film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Mrs. Judi Dench named best actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, won the Variety Award for allowing the British film to be under international spotlight.
The awards were distributed during the ceremony at London's Round House.
Control recounts Curtis's rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black-and-white film, which was directed by The Killers, David Bowie, and New Order, was shot on a budget of just $3 million.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best debutant director.
Rock also won Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple’s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
Viggo Mortensen was awarded the Best Actor Award for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, famous for his tough character performances, won the Richard Harris Award for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, having shot films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones' sequel, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of star Harris, who starred in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to cinema," he said.
“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admired by this great actor right now, I was extremely honored.”
The independent film Oscars, better known as the Bifas, are awarded by a jury of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 activists involved in organising cells manipulating an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on ecclesiastical and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the US-allied monarchy since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly set up a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006 against Abqaiq's largest oil site.
The newspaper, citing a statement from the interior minister, said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile launching expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 people among the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of clerics and armed forces.
The government has urged ecclesiastics to do more against Saudi-led Iraqis to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and against the U.S.-allied Shia Muslim government, considered heretical according to the hard line of the Saudis.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clerics have collaborated with the authorities to support the royal family policy that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
"A great deal of effort has been made by the armed forces over the past five months," the interior minister's spokesman said on state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of Medina organized into a “media cell” aimed at promoting “takfiri thought”, the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus has certainly been a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit has shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are virtually the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had Earth-like conditions, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation coupled with a slower rotation has led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead there.
The findings of Venus Express, the European Space Agency's probe, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface."
Enriched uranium sequestered by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people had been arrested and the material was currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the commodity would have a value of $1 million.
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to speed as a presidential candidate, to answer a snowman’s questions.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who had registered their questions submitted them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions posed were as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats about their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers largely reflected the conditions of the Republican party, which is a candidate in the next election.
It is not known on what criteria, the producers of CNN, who sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on a single topic, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they would hear pleasant things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates spoke rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who led the major early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (offering illegal immigrants a regular status and the opportunity to become a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to delve deeper into the subject.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they started fighting immigration before and more incisively than the others.
In general, the candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, coupled with concerns, particularly about the Chinese-made toxic toys affair, or other fears about the outside world, encourage Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the entire contents of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if he is not sure of believing the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected that Mike Huckabee, who was in a position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, would declare the death penalty painful though necessary.
When people insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said Jesus was too chic to run for office.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious research into grants conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles in Wednesday’s debate.
These two emerged out of nowhere, thanks to the fact that the two party protégés were unable to agree on who was the best known and most traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate unified the party early and convincingly through a message of success on American greatness bringing leaders closer together.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pain of Labour
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra marital toes sucked.
But now there is a revelation that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than $1.3m, that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the prime minister backtracked on his election bill, stupidly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped instead to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, like Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown transformed himself from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The buyout of Northern Rock, a struggling bank at the edge of the crack, demonstrated a flaw in guidelines and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have provoked a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative mess.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting the reductions in military spending: they proclaimed that being minister of defense is for them a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of the Labour Party (and his former head of vigilance) made them have to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading out.
However, governments may come to a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and don’t trust them, but they usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration is no longer working; the cabinets of ministers are taking stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is on the defensive and no longer having any goal.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to dispose of Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions made when he was British Treasury Chancellor.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the lengthy investigation into the party’s “money accountable to members of the House of Lords” funds, voters might think otherwise.
But Mr. Brown's plight is not as tragic as it sounds.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as members of the Tories party make them believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to materialize Mr. Brown’s old Stalinist tendencies, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character who compares his donations to charity, said he does not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of politicians’ big sponsors are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has a right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, unaware that this was illegal, will therefore have to be interviewed, as did Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraising officer who had spoken about the questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: There is no indication that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party’s legislative flaw, but he did not draw attention to the fact that decision-making power rests on a thing he knows well, resorting to a committee of inquiry on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent Committee on Standards of Public Life, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on political party finances.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could cause it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter like Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage in elections; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate flawless integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see fiddles swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures the non-recoverable or non-recoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, in part because of the weakness of cardholders.
It’s still too early to panic.
Fees and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the third-quarter insolvency rate of 3.89% is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly attributable to technical factors.
A 2005 U.S. law change regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp fall in bankruptcy filings, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of filings (and hence insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in credit card capital security is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicted that the volume of broadcasts for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate loans are gone.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow rather than wealth value, and so falling real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in borrower credibility.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority for repayment.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid stock pick-up.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial catastrophe in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market drive America into recession, the industry will certainly face a gruesome future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to testify about a fraud committed by Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first pleaded not guilty to seven counts of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to enrich himself despite their employees.
They are due to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. Justice Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland’s PLC group, became famous across Britain due to two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
Charges against the bankers, dubbed the Natwest Three, claim to have come to Houston in 2000 to stage a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary to be null and void, but in fact the three Britons already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest from the bank of the subsidiary for 1 million pounds.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth that $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers reportedly earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for three years and a month in a Texarkana prison.
The three Britons were released following the payment of a $1 million each bail, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting gimmicks, could no longer hide its billions in debt or even propose its phony speculations as profitable.
The collapse has caused thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in loss of market value and more than $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the company’s collapse.
Skilling has been sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
Lay's charges of conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were in vain because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Not in or out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs as many seats as they do because it’s more of a family plane or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Salon des Millionnaires, a consumer incentive orgy, for four days, which is held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to roll in black gold, like Dallas.
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans got so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world’s biggest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are composed of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are globally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists at the center of economic and financial research.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a jeweller from London.
She was attending the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, The Jeweller Group of Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking around the salon, Sunday night, the two real estate agents placed on their 31st, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, declare themselves to be like their customers, millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the caps to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum canines, Mövenpick ice creams, custom billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears Gund are on display.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal factory stand for Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a handmade wall painting by Raimbrant on blue tiles.
“Russians are more interested in bling bling.”
Indeed, sellers said here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years is too much by Russian standards) have already switched from shining logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, roam the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses inlaid with golden threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By noon on Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles.
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more than you might think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has erected four booths representing the British telephone booths, filled with mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers-by arrested to throw masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unapproved Surgeon Suspected of Homicide in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and watched an ambulance just stopped at the gates of the Cape Cod white on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
and then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone was dead.
Authorities later learned that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo’s death, but they are confidently waiting for the results of toxicology tests that will unfortunately take time, but that should solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant to Police Director Garry F. Mc Carthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
“She was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done everything to protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she leaves two 14- and 11-year-old sons, along with a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsj, spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Miss Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgery.
“This is a possibility to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3:00 p.m.
and found Miss Arroyo on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since then, and authorities have not said much about the investigation nor even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house was being used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of Ms. Castro’s house where a faded rose tree rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called “Ethyl Vanillin” used as a substitute for vanilla in cooking and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door leading to the ground.
Two off-road bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower rates related to the global stock market boom.
Shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would try to calm credit terms, subsequently lowering interest rates promoted by the US central bank vice president’s soothing statements.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, said those who decide must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in the hectic financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence has in part “reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
Should this harsh turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of a subsequent rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further reductions in interest rates could stabilize credit terms.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news on the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil were heightened following the statement by investment bank Bear Stearns, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 positions are planned in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55% to 13,289.40 while the largest index, the S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 took 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to 6306.2 adding more than 39€ to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted following the strong demand for an auction of monthly sort funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at the heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London’s financial markets causing credit tensions has caused the monthly “Libor” tri-borrowing rates of British banks to cause their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a sharp rise since Nov. 12.
England faces a call for judgment against critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 drummer for England at Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the coaches who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the president and chief executive officer of England, begins to complete the application forms to become a national coach, at least on a part-time basis.
Anyone who fails to win the No. 6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is the sport.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes out of lack of luck more than out of lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to raise Bopara?
Is it just in relation to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which one to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new managers with good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless at least one chance is given?
Figures matter in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the day cricketer.
But catching the eyes of selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in top form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class gates in 33 laps to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett has only taken 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it is Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and did well in the first, with five gates and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double-cent against Australia in Australia can still be underestimated.
Probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and foster Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the 88 Test innings in Bombay, 32 first-class cents against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah made only ten laps in his two May innings against the Caribbean during the Lord Test, his hometown of Middlesex, and that, the immediate rejection by the coaches when Vaughan was back in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have plagued his momentum so evident in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy of life.
Nothing frightens him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently crashed into a 4x4 at a Volkswagen presentation, sponsor of England.
He only reported minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at him from afar, to ask if he had seen this?
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his streamlined look allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could this be the true art of selection?
I’d be good at giving Bopara a chance, which doesn’t mean Shah shouldn’t apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he’ll be playing this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring out these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has returned to normal.
Some have returned to fight against the militants who have taken them away from home.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival in Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army does not commit any more crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amaryah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to inform him that the US-aided militia allowed him to drive al Qaeda west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad due to a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been drawn to the capital’s growing calm since U.S. troops arrived, and to the ongoing sight of well-armed “citizen groups” collaborating with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Prime Minister of Syria, who reportedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two-and-a-half million people reportedly fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to no longer give Iraqis visas to force them back into Iraq,” Sunni said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will further increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Small Saarland, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in vocational training, and even shines through the international orientation of its graduate schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-deception, post for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a large role in the training system of the Saarland, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high share of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saarland also leads the children of the country to higher schools in excess of the average - many of them without a degree from the Gymnasium.
"In the Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people earn their degree in a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combining professional and academic training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double-curriculum panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
That is why the Sardinian Ministry of Education has forced the higher schools to a marketing campaign in the subjects of engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we have celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education said.
Thus the government introduced all over the federated state comparison tests.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of daycare is exempt from law - a model that other federated states copy as well.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether students’ performance is improving sustainably.
In PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of at-risk students decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not improve as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of the Sardinians, the knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise you could earn points in this field.
Because the neighbor's language is mandatory in high schools - even if the Sarrois are not French.
Chávez sets the clocks
In Venezuela, watches will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will bring up the half-hour stopwatch in the South American country.
Chavez has since become a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, the watches will be set to minus four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a matter of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have relations either with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
“I can’t, already only because of my dignity,” said Chávez, who hastens a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe’s decision to withdraw from Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe reportedly spit in Venezuela’s face with this decision, Chavez said on Sunday.
In Spain, Chávez is also in all mouths.
A new cell phone ringtone is raging across the country: “Why don’t you shut up” is the phrase that already more than half a million people have uploaded to the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was angered by the constant interpellations of left-wing populists and who told him to shut up.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, a real wage loss threatens German workers this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in the low wage development, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economics Research told the Bild newspaper.
There could also be new burdens on unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected 3.3 percent drop in unemployment insurance for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
It was learned Tuesday that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices rose 3.0 percent year-over-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind swirls at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that there are flashes of lightning on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has brought proof of this today - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus bursts at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprin, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
"If life has been there, it must have been at a very ancient date in history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be few living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be Earth’s infernal twin, but it remains a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like Earth in mass and dimensions, has been hit by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in the search for Venus, as no probes were on their way to explore this planet since the 1980s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" do not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more than assumed at first.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the wind swirls already known at the north pole, a swirl of clouds at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called the evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much slower on itself: one Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
Of the two, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for an end to the party quarrel over the Dalai Lama's welcome to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and sums up the great coalition to close the quarrel about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should keep a sensitive balance on foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the accusations that she would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
“China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's reception and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, about the CDU’s “frontline policy” on foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama was welcomed to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government not only dismissed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to reports from the Spiegel, also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
China’s head of government Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that welcoming the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive Tibet’s spiritual leader in his official functions, Wen Jiabao said.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns of riots like those in France.
Street fights with police, shootings, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
“Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets through violence,” he said.
Barricades are burning, breakers are shooting at the police with shotguns: after the serious riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not also build up in our home and defuse itself with violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
“From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes.”
But it would be too early for an end to alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time that in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government required the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the quota of unemployed youth under 25 from immigration would be above average.
Above all, there should be more training.
Kolat insisted: “We need to give young people a perspective.”
The president of the Turkish communities added, however, that there was more social control in families in Germany than in France.
Many young people from the immigration community also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat exhorted: “But we still have to be careful.”
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
In the meantime, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with spotlights.
Authorities have reported three arrests as well as a few cars and garbage burnt.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the troubles overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots erupted after a traffic accident in which two young men lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
The Empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor’s utopian entry into the scene shows that the coalition has finished with the bottom – and that there is nothing more to expect from her.
In what country exactly does this chancellor live?
After her bleak intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by her.
The accusation of too much focus on politics has been pushed back by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It’s provincial, she said and only showed by that that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, it made it visible to everyone how true this accusation was.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a heavy-handed politician, who flees into foreign policy and who even there remains in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes again and again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how climate goals should be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of himself - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now it is clinging to all-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
In this way it destroys his image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela Cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases left for this.
In this regard, it is revealing the number of times it has lapsed when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to utter a half-precise sentence.
She hesitates in unfamiliar terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, both favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates already breaks out on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the illegals", accuses Mitt Romney of his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
Giuliani said: “I would say his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants,” and accused the former governor of Massachusetts of employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates rise to the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates primarily use the debates on CNN to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that internet users have sent via Youtube are hardly more than blowers.
“It’s with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power,” McCain told his nominee Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal of Iraq.
Romney is also vigorously taught by Vietnam veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture so-called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and debates about torture can be seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg common room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are rented or future tax increases are refused, applause is pouring into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites once again appear.
“I made a mistake at that time,” Romney says, apologizing to the base and the television audience for still being an abortion advocate in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani goes into a running knot when asked his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian life.
One day after his retirement as army chief, Pakistani power man Musharraf was sworn in as president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army end.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as Chief of Armies to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after he took power in a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of state.
With this withdrawal from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another requirement of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the state of emergency was instituted with lawyers from his ranks, last week dismissed all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghan border.
The fathers of Krautrock are returning.
Germany’s supergroups of the seventies replayed: the three members of the group Harmonia again took their console at a concert in Berlin.
For their return came recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced for the evening poster.
Everyone has their little box in front of them, their cable and above all their buttons.
63-year-old Dieter Moebius sits in the middle of a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left by 57-year-old Michael Rother, who owns a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this is inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the group Harmonia is playing again has ensured some emosion among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name reason in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a lasting way that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why wouldn’t the German have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is deceptively called "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the 2003 Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, we saw in the hall the interrogating German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in panegyric praise, the astonishment was limitless.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and during this period the impact power that was felt was much weaker than what was later attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a church-subsidized label, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly troubled himself in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile in the woods of Weserbergland.
There, in an old Weser farmhouse, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-called was in the garbage bin a fan of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for art.
Many retain Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
For as serene and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered from material misery.
Harvesting dead wood was not for self-seeking.
The newly released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as someone thinks they remember.
Rother expressed at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and secured its existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (hearts on fire).
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmonia ever had.
We owe Griessem's live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Her label Grönland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been dug up on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
Harmonia’s physical resurrection takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be surrounded with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase hovers in the room amid the singular sounds: “The only real music, you listen to the future.”
There are pictures showing producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of tools wired in bazaar serve to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are busy improvising again.
But more by gluing microphones to the organ and the drums, to shoot the instruments sounds unprecedented thanks to the effects instruments built by yourself.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
The three of them are great technicians.
Even the choir of the house will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, one coughs and whispers under the cloud of sounds, and sings at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
Roots have been less sought in the blues than in conservatories of music (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts “68” is not totally wrong, and Harmonia too is no longer irritated by this now.
But what goes most of itself will be meticulously covered on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
It can hit someone’s nerves (?) or give fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With “The Hunting Party” and “Murdering Peace,” two films revisit the Balkan War.
But the two do not convince.
Either the projects rely too much on action and the exchange of senseless shots or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news is that the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan Mountains, but it is here, in the darkest hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is found.
We had lastly lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because far too many kind and futile roles in women's sentiment films and far too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism delighted him with the desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch anyway "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why should today's films be as long and confusing as locomotive driver collective agreements?)
He delivers a magnificent performance full of winks: deep down, his character as war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument in its decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Peace Killer", which also releases this week, the endless sequel of failed films about the Balkan war.
From "Murderous Peace" we can quickly make the trial: the film talks about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, in which one of the two still falls quickly in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not presented for once as the only causes of all evils, this film as flat as a TV movie is lost much too quickly in the action and exchanges of senseless shots.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why deep down there has never been a real good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track down the top war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both at once Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go in small teams in the forest, to accomplish something the military can’t do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we just don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to her a romantic adventure with a Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, within the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, achieves what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge on the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so bad that we should bring the case before the International Criminal Court in The Hague against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt intensively enough because of secret political agreements.
But the good intention and the bad are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He talks about a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet’s desk: “Patience, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be mean.”
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but that hint at how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all the Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been good films about South Africa.
Which is worth every time: when a star hangs out on a hotbed or a minefield, it then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, it’s always been decades before Hollywood can make a good holocaust movie with “Schindler’s List.”
Some films have yet to mature - those that are now worth classic Vietnam works like "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were in no way celebrated unanimously in their time as masterpieces.
But maybe today we also know too much about the conflicts of the world, where every hecatomb comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this gives writers the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
“Being or not being” or “The dictator” actually became as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin still didn’t know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps we should have the sarcastic and distant artistic gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's all about the fact that some things never change."
“Great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrific way, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust reaps the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's retreat from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has come up against virulent criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described a dropout Wednesday as “bad for the local economy.”
In recent times, no other project has deployed as much motivating force in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
“Without this objective, the political-sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measure.”
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the bill, but to find a new, longer-term starting point, "which takes another modified agenda as its starting point."
Mayor Ole von Beust said Wednesday that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides to run for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, regarding Munich’s candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the time frame we have predicted until 2028, we will have no chance.”
However, the dream is not definitely a thing of the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity, burying projects already now," HSB President Günter Ploß said Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would further contradict the declarations of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the plenary meeting of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust described Hamburg’s bid for the 2015 Universiade as “not a substitute” for the Hamburg Olympics.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first appointed Hamburg as a candidate city in the past weeks.
The mayor’s SPD faction blamed the Senate for not using that precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grasbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics map and excluded housing construction," SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has always called for an integrated plan for the Little Grasbrook Olympics and subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics, for its part, would have aroused great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg had broken against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' crates.
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
A large part of the eighty Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of Andy Warhol's international Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today leads to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave to the Moderna Muse's other copies in 1995.
Ancient history is entangled, a bewildering chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden crates, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powder soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to have some Brillo wooden crates produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden crates that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as original Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum mistakenly later claimed that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would later have ceded to him.
In truth, the 105 boxes of Hultén were produced in Malmö only in 1990, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, besides the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminate panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
On the contrary, the texture of the copies dating from the year 1990 reveals that the paint was directly applied without a background layer on the laminate panels, using a paint roll - moreover it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come with another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection.
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the “heavy charges” that will be raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers abandoned, the same ones who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to power had shortly before stormed the hotel with tear gas.

National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
