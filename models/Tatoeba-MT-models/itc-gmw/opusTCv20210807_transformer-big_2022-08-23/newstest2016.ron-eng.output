UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the conflict that has lasted for nearly five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday he planned to meet foreign ministers from five countries permanently present on the council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unresolved."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 Figures in Polls That Show Donald Trump Has Real Chances
Some have tried to label him as a flip-flop politician.
Others called it a joke.
Others are waiting for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to knock Donald Trump out of the polls, it hasn’t worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump drives by a double-digit percentage and some voices are beginning to seriously wonder what that means for the real estate mogul’s chances of nominating.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for Republican nomination.
Pundits shows that in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance was given to Herman Cain in polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit to Trump’s power and start supporting him with money.
Here are some figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just something transient:
The numbers indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two in 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the housing mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
In early August, it was 52%.
Six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion about Donald Trump.
Approximately 3 out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures remain.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for the nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “outrageous” if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be “enthusiastic” compared to 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
Closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “angry” if Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52 percent of national Republican voters believe the real estate mogul has the temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted Monday by the ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same numbers in Iowa, where 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to lead, according to a Quinnipiac poll last week.
However, 44 percent say he doesn’t have the personality to act effectively, and nearly six in 10 say his temperament isn’t in the White House, according to the ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters think Trump is authentic.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who is most likely to win the GOP race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: In the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared to just 28 percent for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans backed off to another candidate. Trump is still at the forefront of everyone.
Some voices say the split situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while support against Trump will split into more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush and 33 points behind Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who wins?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have decided.
A new CBS/NYT poll shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they don’t change their voting options.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their options.
However, Trump’s most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely as voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his opening speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic style will lead to a split between leading Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
But according to the ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration and authority are reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely because of their outsider status.
According to the ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider over someone with government experience.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of Republicans in the COngres, with 54 percent declaring themselves “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “nervous at the top.”
Jeremy Corbyn makes his Prime Minister’s Questions debut
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s PMQs debut has been long awaited.
New Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will later make his Prime Minister’s Questions debut, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be examined closely by the media and Labour MPs.
In his weekly appearances, he called for “less theater and more facts.”
He also said he could give up a few entries and give them up to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn’s first parliamentary test in a leading position, coming after he named a “ghost cabinet” and after the speech he gave Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader’s decision to remain silent on the national anthem at a service held on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from Conservative lawmakers and kept the front page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he had "respectfully kept silence" and recognized "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Corbyn’s ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC’s Two’s Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the anthem and “indifferent” to his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the phantom cabinet refused to be part of Mr. Corbyn’s leading team, arguing through differences of opinion related to economics, defense and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth in the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says the policy gap “cumulates” in the Labour Party after Corbyn’s appointment regarding his stance towards the European Union and profit cap.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party will make changes that will completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Smith, the Labour and Pensions Minister, said the party "is very clear" in opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "chief" level from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced on the rostrum in the last decade since taking over the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from outside sources" for questions to ask Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentarian Islington North said PMQs involve too much confrontation and will refrain from retaliation and attacks, pledging instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the finance minister, will take his place at the PMQs when he can’t attend – for example when Mr. Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor occasionally, saying that he approached House Speaker John Bercow to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when Cameron took over, he said he wanted to give up the “Punch and Judy” political style often associated with the PMQs but admitted a few years later that he failed to do so.
Since the first transmission in 1990, PMQs have been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he runs the Chamber of Deputies, and his position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics say it has become a caricature and needs profound reform.
"Frame in Joburg": Homeless young people benefit from photography classes
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and make a living.
“I Was Shot in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas they live in and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports chief says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says a minimum wage increase in the UK could mean “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But that purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labor costs within the firm, he says.
The costs could impact JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis, President of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the “storm” created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior is more praiseworthy than critical, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often referred to as "Special Ks," was awkwardly dragged into the spotlight by Kyrgios' scandalous skipping of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a gruesome qualifying match played shortly after in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to step in twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have grounded Kyrgios, and I should have grounded that."
Although he was last seen doing a powder rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, annoyed by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
“One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little bit to the conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a missile when he lost because he blamed cramps in the US, but he’s not the first player to break a missile out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But let’s face it, he’s mastered very well in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of confidence.
He has a great team, he has a great family and I think he was treated unfairly.
He’s a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and has joined the team, he hasn’t had any conflict with other players, he’s very respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he’s in excellent form, he’s a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on his qualities and flaws.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the important draw, which starts on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most suitable for everyone, but supported the return of the long-term Canberra player to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw match and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick came up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he’s grown up in the public eye and made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we’re trying to support him, we’re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time that he can’t be in the center of his attention.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will run for president, is backed by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say they’ve decided which candidate they’ll support.
But Clinton supporters are more firm in their choice than other candidates.
Compared to the CBS poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percentages.
Clinton retains the upper hand among women and moderates, but the upper hand has diminished.
Support for men has been reduced considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton’s advantage among Democrats under the age of 50 has evaporated, now being on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still at the forefront among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight 5-point lead in this group.
Approximately half of Democrats nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support her somewhat reserved and another 15% would support her just because she represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton’s current supporters will be enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the first-placed, Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question as to why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it is time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
It also mentions the agreement on these issues and eligibility.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential candidate, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race – although a third think they shouldn’t.
When asked about the second option for the party’s representative, Democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second choice, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn’t run.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters consider Clinton the most likely candidate to win the general election, but the numbers have fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden is in second place but the percentage that he is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer problems over eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by many voters to be unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well in terms of a few key features to their party’s primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best seen of these three in terms of integrity, while Clinton’s strong point is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don’t think Clinton is upright and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say so about Sanders (15%), but 27 percent don’t think about him.
Democrats also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
On all these points, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation on the subject and say it didn’t affect their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided on this issue in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy didn’t affect their overall opinion of Clinton, though 36 percent say they’ve changed their mind.
Most Republicans, more than six in 10, say they have changed their mind about Clinton in the negative.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton to be integrity and trustworthy, this continues to raise issues among voters at the general level: only 32 percent consider her integrity and trustworthy, 8 percent less than last month and 15 percent less than in May.
Sixty-two percent of voters don’t consider it fair and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of national voters do not consider Trump to be integrity and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders to be integrity is greater than those who do not agree, but, as in the case of Carson, many do not agree with him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five Brotherhood Members Charged for Murder of Student in Year 1 at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Official sources say the victim was tied to his eyes, put a 14-pound backpack full of sand on his back and was repeatedly smashed as he tried to head towards a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after he fainted and claim to have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
But they found time to change Deng’s clothes, search for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the brother’s national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide their personal belongings and put the good of the brotherhood before the good of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head, trunk and thigh injuries.
“Too many families have been devastated by brotherhood rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life each year because of the rituals,” Douglas Fierberg, Deng’s family lawyer, said in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable and this action taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe District Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with a third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with outrage and complicity in the murder.
“We want to hold not only the people involved responsible but, whether there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or informally, we will also hold it accountable,” Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
The interest rate will rise and the bull market (growing market) will fall, bond returns will rise and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history offers few clues about time frames.
After the first increase in interest rates, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors shouldn’t focus on when the interest rate starts to rise but on the trajectory of time needed for normalization.
There are multiple variables in the game.
But in the end, market players might find that all the turmoil related to the interest rate increase has been exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first rate hike after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of ‘cheap money,’” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal but still low levels to constitute the seismic shock they seem to be afraid of.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Here’s how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, anticipating rising interest rates can volatility things for a while.
However, at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for capital returns to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the monetary policy gap,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed’s increases.
Specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has grown sharply - by about 14 percent - heading towards an interest rate increase, quite unchanged in the 250-day period after (average rise of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Asron Management by the chief strategist No.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits are starting to fall.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In this situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before and could accelerate a recession.
More specifically, gross domestic product will approach its historic low for a Fed interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few are expected to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question “if this time is different,” Deutsche said.
Players in the market have been preparing all year for a Fed growth decision, all eyes being on this week’s Federal Open Market Commission meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in the interest rate at the time of the meeting, forward trades indicate a probability of only 25%.
“In our post-1950 study, all cycles of interest rate growth to date have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with GDP eclipsing the peaks before the recession very quickly after the start of the recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and this has reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster on bonds than on stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate increase cycle, the yield on bonds drops immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that these interest rate increases will bring near profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds do better in such an environment, though “we are still cautious about forcing profitability,” Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the Fed’s policy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the expected fall in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy,” Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is more straight, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased – all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that operate mostly in the U.S. will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Large-debt multinationals will suffer as the growth of the dollar will lead to the cost of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate increase,” Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rate increases by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital receipts and low volatility stocks also outperformed like-minded companies by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the increase in the dollar.
Those who save might also gain, though experts disagree about how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for being "foolish"
It says it is increasingly similar to its commercial adversary.
He also took to the BBC Music Awards, claiming to have plagiarized the Brits awards.
Col. Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying this show isn't original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a senior lawmaker said, putting pressure on the station to prove it is doing something commercial stations don't do.
Conservative lawmaker Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public radio station is “stupid” and increasingly resembles its commercial adversary.
“I feel like Radio 3 is ‘crazy’ – although I don’t like to use the word – but I feel like it’s turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also took to the BBC Music Awards, which were released last December.
The BBC Music Awards, released last year, appear to be Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different – these are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what’s already on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC’s chief executive denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial adversary in terms of live music and public education.
I won't know anything about classical music from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production is unrivalled.
“In addition, I think Radio 3’s commitment to discovering new music and allocating new tracks is also important,” he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he must make more efforts to attract audiences to the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC logo criticized at the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative lawmaker Damien Collins has attacked The Voice – the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch maker Talpa Media for about 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why there is often talk about the show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show – with Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury – be performed “in a specific BBC manner.”
He added that he wants that Corporation to “find the golden egg chicken in its own lair” the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he declined to ban in the future the taking of new seasons of The Voice or to spend money that goes on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the slightest increase in August and could be Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month has seen the slowest growth since 2000.
Online sales gained momentum three years ago, thanks to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could lead to reluctance to spend.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain’s shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the lowest increase since 2000 to date, with an increase of just 5% over the past year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the level of growth in previous years and look back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to streamline over time,” Andy Mulcahy, an editor at the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales gained momentum three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to shop.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do so in various circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it is stagnant, you may notice a decrease (increase).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
According to the experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers crowded in front of computers to get their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of several retailers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers struggled with bargains, could cause shoppers to be reluctant.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least 1 in 5 pounds is spent online.
For certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion stores in shopping areas.
After the Bin Laden family sanction, Muslims bury the victims killed in the collapse of the crane in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were taken to the streets by Muslims, with the first funeral taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
Health Minister says 394 people were injured in the crane crash
At the ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed in a crane crash at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who mourned their dead joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead arrived at the end of the final journey, at Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory of the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for the funeral after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group for the disaster, which also resulted in 394 injuries.
In a street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed in a crane crash at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his clients before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still alive.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane’s arm up when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi news agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not present the details, but said the company’s leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane’s collapse in the Grand Mosque’s courtyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have come before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not yet made any statements about the crane collapse and Group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and not coordinating its work with meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the Saudi royal family and are carrying out major construction projects.
The last Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a son "renegade", disinherited by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in conditions of strong wind and rain, just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to attend the pilgrimage, essential trip at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities have decided that relatives of the deceased receive one million Saudi Rials (174,000 pounds) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Others will receive half that amount.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Converting Credits to Swiss Francs
On the banking market there have already appeared two offers of conversion in lei of credits in Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when the variable interest rate can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting credits into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its customers.
According to data accumulated by analysts of financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest at lei, of 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the Transylvania Bank’s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of customers with credits in francs due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced with the amount of risk and management fees paid by the customer, then an additional 22.5% reduction was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to the equivalent monthly plateau in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the next years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the loan cover in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from future increases of the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which he collects his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that no reassessment of ownership, no further guarantees and another proof of income are required.
Practically, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the loan, nor will there be additional costs as in the case of a refinancing firm.
Also, both banks offer a discount at the monthly rate, compared to how much plateau customers before conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the early years is made up more of the interest rate, and the customer pays back very little of the principal.
The Bancpost offer with very low interest rates in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
It is not known how this rate will change after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so in total, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest rates is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor index - CHF).
For example, the three-month ROBOR is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached the value of 6%, in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days since 2008 it has exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to show other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
It’s time for interest rate decisions for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is looking ahead to the meeting scheduled for two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half of whom last week believed that the decision would be made, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be kept within the current range of 0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Stars who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 she struggled with leukemia and in 2009 she lost her life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly comes at a cost.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is on the line for several months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in Manchester United's Champions League match, ending with a loss to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to his eyes and will keep him on the line for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident came after a reckless intervention by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, after 20-year-old Shaw broke the PSV’s defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: “He has a double fracture in his leg and is in the hospital.”
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day and then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
It’s awful – a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, has difficulties, then plays fantastic and now something like this is happening.
The oxygen mask was put in his locker room.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor, but at double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play this season again.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped the red card and the granting of a penalty kick.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official had succeeded.
You can judge yourself when you say it's fault and red card.
It was a very bad intervention with two legs.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for the messages, I don’t have words to express how weak I feel, I start the road to recovery, I’ll come back stronger.”
Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat
The England team founder has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: “It’s a very bad injury.
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to crash an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico against Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very hard for him because he didn’t intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it’s a very serious injury, it’s not good,” Cocu said.
I haven't seen the phase.
I could only see the ball going in another direction, so it seemed like [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn’t see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it’s like, I know how difficult it is to go through this.
I feel really bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission, but he's still holding fast.
Pakistan’s victory in the UAE is a difficult task, but after seeing the team England selected for the tournament, I don’t consider a 3-0 defeat repeat in the test matches.
I wouldn't rule out a victory on the move either.
Alastair Cook’s team may have less experience than three years ago but they have good players on the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youth attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even though unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Adam Lyth left the England team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales.
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it’s difficult for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no questions about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that before - the players are their own pickers.
Some fifty years and maybe Lyth would have prolonged his run but his destiny lies in his hands.
I hope that if he does more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when the performance wasn’t as good as it was and I’m not surprised by that; first of all, he’s a team man.
It’s hard to answer the question as long as a batsman gets noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs – like Sam Robson before him – while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and on the go.
The only dissatisfaction you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
Alex Hales, a batsman, is on the team.
He is a cricket player who has the “X factor” and we noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as before, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open up with Cook, which would lead to extra spinner keeping four quicks at the same time, and I have nothing against it.
I don’t see why a pitcher couldn’t hit there and this left-handed player has already proven he’s fucked up.
Moeen may not have brought success to his district of Worcestershire, but he was number three for growth, so the difference isn't big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test 38 games as a first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a back-up spinner and, although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People might judge his young age – with an average of 31 per beating and 35 per ball – and might think he’s pointy, but there’s not a lot of spinners and the pickers have opted for youth.
You will learn a lot from this tour.
England also made a few changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted previously, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham’s teammate Ben Stokes is resting for the day, Root has been given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although they do not agree, coaches and coaches do not do the program.
And you have to remember, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy.
Brexit camp could win if the economy stays calm by 2017
As the day passes, David Cameron’s renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets increasingly messed up, even without the choice of genius Jeremy “Yes or no?” Corbyn at the head of the Labour Party or TUC brings grave criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
Aliens also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained last week that – sunk in crises similar to the one in the EU – not all are provoked internally – some member states are fed with the UK’s agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, at the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they do not want it either if it erodes social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George’s “selfie” agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain under the roof of the EU – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” Berlin says – suggests that several ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don’t care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s highly cautious chancellor, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation falls apart, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16 years), who stayed too long.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to believe that they will help the posing English, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers may even plan to intentionally make remarks that do not help, in the style of the SNP, in the campaign for the UK referendum in 2017 to hasten the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
“The renegotiation was fixed” and “the UK got nothing of value from the renegotiation.”
Europeans know how sceptical Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic press is about the EU because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn that ratified our 1973 entry into the 2:1 report.
I may recall Boris Johnson, the euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a correspondent in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of non-tax-paying bags, foreigners who cheated on the phone, and pseudo-non-domes who owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them the same way, but realized that when you’re locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron’s idea of a referendum, given that Blair made a concession to the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn’t forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me in the back on Monday at Westminster – I told him not to waste his time with me – seems to be in danger of adopting from egg Murdoch’s strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it needs to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose position at the BBC left her vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I would leniently call evolution.
He says he would like to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservative “anglicism” might agree with that.
That’s what Hilary “A Benn, but not a Bennite” Benn said on radio and TV this week, when the scout in him struggled not to acknowledge that Corbyn’s appointment as a “shadow minister” on financial matters was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to fellow Labourers, without going too far and without losing his office in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “in any situation” doesn’t match what McDonnell said or what JC told colleagues and lawmakers at Monday night’s private meeting.
Whatever image Corbyn wants to convey – remember, it also sensitized me – the discipline of messaging remains important in the age of television and especially in the whirlwind of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is fair not to give Cameron a favor ticket in Europe, allowing him to take good support of Labour in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes that.
But McDonnell and Corbyin’s basic sophistication about EU membership – in line with their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom small-difference narcissism is a central dogma.
As with his NATO sophism – Tom Watson is unwavering about the fact that JC will not campaign for renunciation – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – and there are suspicious voters – for concessions to the UK when everything could be useless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of them with ties to the tobacco industry.
Experts on the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “reference” report last month and described it as a “complex analysis of evidence.”
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked “the extraordinarily fragile base” on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned the claims and their basis “on solid ground or moving sand.”
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said they expect PHE’s claims that “current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In reality, a single meeting of 12 people led to the development of a Multi-criteria Decision Analysis Model (MCDA) that summarized their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
It also validated the BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting said they received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding that is reported to have been received from the tobacco and cigarette company, Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but among them are a few known "faces" in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare in the paper the financing of the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control section of the PHE.
The group’s research “convincingly identifies” the lack of “strong evidence for the harmful effect that most products have on most criteria,” McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “there is so far no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE’s director of health, says the BMJ claims have been answered in the past.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have smoked their entire lives loses their lives because of this addiction.
All evidence suggests that the risk of e-cigarettes to health is lower compared, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of information that is and is not evidence-based, particularly in view of the high degree of public confusion regarding relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives due to a smoking-related illness and the annual costs of smoking to the national health system amount to 2 billion pounds.
Clearly speaking, the current evidence - namely that although the use of e-cigarettes is not without risks, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
Advertisements that embarrass Britain’s arms trade
Watch the Amnesty International film against the arms trade.
Terrible killer drones!
Beast for crushing the ankles!
Dispersed bombs!
And electric sticks that cause terrifying pain without leaving a trace!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world’s largest arms trade show is a fierce charade made by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities’ desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.
DSEI Arms Fair: Authoritarian Regimes Arrive in London
But a separate campaign also led to a large number of posters being displayed in bus stations and subways that needed a second look.
“Important announcement, do you travel with the DLR between September 15 and 18?” says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London Underground, with the DLR line turning into a tank image.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will hit the DLR Clients are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London using “Ad Space Hack Packs,” a 6-pound package of Allen keys that it says “facilitate access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stations on the planet.”
London’s transport director is not amused by this “vandalism” in the form of a steering wheel.
One of the spoof ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists are heading towards collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-arms trade poster greeting commuters on the subway.
The film made by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who dubbed the voice also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the arms trade ad – with an empty space in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with making a more realistic advertisement but “enriching it with animations and powerful colors, it was more striking.”
“They did a great job of helping us increase interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair,” said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, UK authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not being illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the theme of the arms fair comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order it received from the U.S. military regarding “AT4CS RS with shoulder-mounted launcher.”
This includes “a uniquely shaped spotlight that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in the home
It’s been 11 years since I moved into my home, when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in beer and moral relativity, but it’s only now that I can remember the forced smiles of those I was annoying – and the many complaints to others.
Most of what we have learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states that range from nervous breakdown to dread.
The talk is tempting: to tell people where you came from, if and where you spent a year off from school, what you think of Corbyn, and why “sincerely, Marmite is indifferent to you because, for real boys, it’s nothing but HAHAHA yeast extract, you find me in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe - ask questions and be interested.
These encourage conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from those you wouldn’t talk to even if the flood came and they were the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Bedrooms often abound with drinks parties, movie nights, and social gatherings, but they’re also where people dress and try their underwear.
Next Next post: Don’t even think about starting a student life in a relationship
Introverts get special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes a culture of periphery through bedrooms is being built, based on friendship, socialization, and lifelong friends.
All this can be terrible for someone trying to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want you to remain friends, but I want you to leave to recover the energy I’ve consumed by interacting with you.”
Try to notice when a colleague is exhausted by socializing – and try to text instead of knocking on the door.
Speaking of knocking on the door: do it.
A guy who sat in the same house as me had a policy that if a door wasn’t locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen enough.
Make friends by cooking.
Given that you start college in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to get acquainted and go and a black plate, it seems less strange, less like the situation in the '50s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've cooked something for you, now it's smiling and I'm asking personal questions."
Homemade goodies are a great way to make friends.
Your co-workers will feel compelled to talk and may end up associating your figure with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you have to be a good chef.
Meal, sugar, and fat cushions will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when knocking on the door.
Theft of food is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, if you wipe someone’s chicken is stealing, but if you take a drop of milk to put in your tea is still stealing?
Ask the owner.
It will probably tell you to serve yourself even if it boils on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you - still try to approach the issue more mature than my co-worker, who colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole it.
Now he's in jail.
Don’t make noise that won’t let others sleep or study.
That’s not just because it’s common sense, but because you’re on your own.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to give the music slower because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to make the music louder.
When they finally stopped music at 5 a.m., the girl was kind and let them sleep for two hours before turning on the music, locked the door and left for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if the future husband/wife moved on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extremely strange if you mistook a co-worker for your future spouse, got married, broke up, and you should meet each other every day and maybe even see him or her take over all of your common friends?
Of course, you can’t resist your heart – but if a sexy co-worker is definitely not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
The thrilling moment you realize that someone has left their keys in the room unlocked, the line between hoax and intimidation is finer than it seems.
A fake joke is funny, but it can be distorted in a few moments.
Teach a fun and valuable safety lesson by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and place the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but do not glue someone's belongings to the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: There were no world tours in Bach’s time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, rightly "weird", as he says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one month, when the cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu were not missing.
Both performances, held on the stage of Athens, showed the audience a different way of performing classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 as the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra – they speak of instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as “specialist workers.”
They feel like they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, the whole musical fetish is focused on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, does its own marketing.
We are no longer talking about music.
So if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and an audience that can’t listen but has to look, which is stupid again,” Grimal said.
The violinist says that this change in the way he makes music came as a result of the "musical deceptions" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So, I've found no point in continuing on this road.
So I decided to create Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at the time no one did this without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians in which there is no ego?" asks the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", noting that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the ensemble's existence, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be an obstacle in the musical act: "Curiously, the more we sing a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not only in the role", says Grimal, adding that at the show on Sunday "we were 74 on the scene".
In Grimal’s opinion, the Enescu Festival is a “very courageous one”, precisely because he also invited Les Dissonances: “An extraordinary festival, where the greatest orchestras in the world are present who sing three times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you have invited this strange group as well”.
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there was a place and interest in something different that broke barriers.
Speaking of Enescu’s opera, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu’s works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal advocates for a change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the musician's office, as it is organized today, has a deadly lure" and that "the future of music represents music itself".
We don’t need to go around the world five times a year if it’s no use.
There were no world tours in the Bach era.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tours, album releases, they are all great, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal set an example for Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before you entered the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU, you had to pass sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are at the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
The same thing happens with music, it’s the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes tomatoes may not be too beautiful, but when you cut them they are real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done with education policy.
“If we consider – as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese do – that Western music is one of the most beautiful things in humanity, we reintroduce its learning to school, we reintroduce concerts to television, and through this education there would be no need to sell musical by-products,” Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communistic, that's everywhere, it's something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we train a musician who will play an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to train a soldier, it has to be one way, if we want to train a musician, it is quite another.
“What, in your opinion, is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?” he asked with a smile.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this status of "soldier", overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert come out smiles".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist at the “Idea Festival”, a discussion with the audience organized by the Aspen Romania Institute at the George Enescu International Festival.

Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: dubbing two characters from the overproduction "Snowfall 3D"
Do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child, who likes movies?
Give him the chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children between the ages of 8 and 16, Cinema City is looking for “Little Big Voices,” giving them the extraordinary opportunity to duplicate two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic drawings the emphasis was placed on bringing the voice of the actor closer to the specifics of the animated character, lately, the creation of the story is also taken into account those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are launching an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the replicas are funny.
“The children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors,” said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between September 11th and September 30th, Cinema City is organizing a pre-selection that will select 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a sample in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents need to do is to access the platform petitelevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where they can enroll the child in the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Afterwards, he has to choose one of the four movies available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read, and then the child will register playing his own version of dubbing.
Four films about friendship, fairytale heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the test: "Yellow Pene 3D", "Mountain: Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala the 3D Possessor" and "Maya 3D Bees".
In the end, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double up on a character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Snow Craiasa 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx earnings are mixed, lower fiscal forecasts for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter as the delivery giant cut profit estimates for the full year as a result of low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening bell sounded.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts forecast the figure at $10.84, according to a poll conducted by FactSet.
The falling estimate comes despite price increases of 4.9% on average, with the 4th of January taking effect and higher surcharges for ground transportation of large or heavy packages that will apply from November.
The company said it is still expecting higher earnings from the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said: “The firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of global production and trade.”
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after the UPS competitor said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as it did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit increased 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has led to stagnation in revenues from its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping jumped FedEx Ground’s bottom line.
In the last quarter, revenues of the ground division increased by 29% but operating revenues stagnated virtually due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded revenue growth due to higher base tariffs, while revenues from the freight division declined due to rising costs.
On pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares dropped by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
Closed Tuesday was down 11% year-on-year and 17% from the record high on June 11.
At the most anticipated meeting in recent years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it’s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the meeting room of the central bank, will be seen a mural of the United States.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed president, and her colleagues must put the nation’s economic interests above all else.
The central bank has been given a double task by Congress: to maximize the U.S. employment rate and maintain price stability.
But since the big economic crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the factor X in a decision that will be too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be relieved of the unprecedented stimulus offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place from the end of 2008.
Even if most data point to a strong growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already wary of adding volatility by raising the benchmark rate to federal funds – even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and the main issues that will follow,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were to look for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the growing uncertainty in the world market would be enough to give them reason to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on the Fed’s decision, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg have forecast an interest rate increase this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a drop on the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policymakers would mitigate the blow by promising it would take a long time until the next increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The move was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising for the Fed to raise the interest rate at this point,” Lonski said.
If Fed decision makers do this, “they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets.”
Other experts said an increase in the interest rate would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percent this month, the first small step toward a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected interest rates to rise this year despite objections from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Salary gains showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fall short of the central bank’s annual target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
“The economy can cope at higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to enter fibrillation at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below the record high in May as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market declined somewhat this month, with the Dow index now about 10 percent below its May high.
For Fed decision makers, the market turmoil adds to the complex calculation of the timing of the interest rate increase.
“Without what has happened in the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, we would be more steadfast at the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now, he predicts that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy and they almost don’t have data to rely on after the events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
The mere allusion of then-president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “enhance” its monetary expansion has triggered tremors in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials are expected to not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at well-being management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that “Fed has an oversized reaction history to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to economic bases.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported raising the interest rate, gave the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that affected Asia caused the Fed to lower the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the implications of limited identification for US development,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials revisited the declines.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis such as the 2008 market quake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate-setting commission.
The last turbulent period did not rise to that level, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to get into the situation of fearing an interest rate increase because markets have been upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, I do not think it should take premature action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite Nine's attempts to broadcast on the Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to broadcast on the subject of the consequences of the changes in the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
Nine's early morning broadcast aired from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of several weeks, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "crusade" of distance did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday’s (317.000) and Tuesday’s (283,000) audiences, but the numbers were lower than last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has an average viewership of 349,000 and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened all morning.
This morning, it’s not just Parliament that is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the question!

The main news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to do a show on his own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Audience results for last night resonated with “yes.”
The X Factor show broadcast by Seven remained in position, with 1,136 million viewers, taking lightly to The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of Andrew O’Keefe’s new moderated general culture show had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia had an average viewership of 520,000 and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The fall in Chase Australia's audience on the second night will give Nine's tacit confidence that Hot Seat will eventually triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to defeat McGuire’s show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Chodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under fire at an airport in Siberia.
Because he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democracy efforts were dwindled.
Four people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at crowds demonstrating against the country’s proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas and then fired shots into the air before resorting to using rubber bullets.
According to him, 20 police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhesi say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also occurred in western Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent clashes that broke out on August 10.
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new but highly controversial issue in centrally governed Nepal for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, police and weapons
The Prime Minister continues his exchange of views with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm position on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or police with weapons.
"It is a shame for Europe in the 21st century to apply methods from the 1930s," Ponta said.
"The prime minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and set at the CSAT meeting on Thursday," the prime minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A large low-pressure front about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent likely to turn into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles also shows a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight Reduction Surgery Could Be Useful For Diabetics With Mild Obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with mild obesity and type 2 diabetes could last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those who undergo non-surgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of measurement of weight relative to height, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in the sleeve - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI in people who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatments for diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes cured completely at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the medically treated group, by comparison, diabetes cured completely in only 1% and partially in only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored the blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of blood sugar over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at about 8%.
But this improved “glycaemic control” – reflected by improved hemoglobin A1c levels – did not reduce the death rate to five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomy group in the sleeve, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), experienced more pronounced decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and had a higher likelihood of complete diabetes, 16% of complete diabetes remission.
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on heavyweights in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona, School of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared with a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic aspect for people with BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
“This is the point where this work is critical, because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that their patients and doctors should start taking their weight seriously when the patient’s BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to urge people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they’ve accumulated these genetic changes that have short-circuited their bodies, predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it’s extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not welcome all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the refugee mother countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He affirmed that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It’s great to care for a few thousand refugees, but we need to think at the same time about long-term solutions to bring genuine peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the September 11 terrorist attacks, saying the violent response from the US generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of September 11, I sent my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the past 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, the U.S. Anti-Poison Centers have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed high-alcohol hand detergent.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, cases of hand detergent ingestion in children under 12 years of age reported at anti-poison centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them arrive at the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children intentionally drink detergent and others do it to impress their friends or respond to challenges on social media.
You can watch movies on YouTube that show teenagers how to drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It turns out that teenagers have mixed the detergent with oral water with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the detergent.
“A child doesn’t think it’s hurting them,” says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types of hand detergents are perfumed.
Hand detergents with strawberry flavor, grapes, orange are the most attractive for children.
Hand detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison center at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave the same hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four strawberry-flavoured hand detergent sprays at school, has arrived at the emergency room for treatment.
She had blood alcohol179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah stinked and could not go when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
“It was frightening,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free wet products or napkins and not to leave hand detergent out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
Sanitary authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in northern New York plotted to poison their “bad” teacher by “putting antibacterial products in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned it in her classroom.
The police considered the plan “insignificant” and referred the disciplinary matter to the school inspectorate.

The absence of the Scots in the race for the title bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic – because they don’t fight for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, now the Ajax ambassador, said: “In the Netherlands I no longer transmit the summary of the matches to the Celtic; why?”
'Cause it's not the Rangers out there.
It’s not just about the Rangers coming back.
We are talking about Old Firm.

The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League was followed by the defeat against Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now in the top of the standings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: “Celtic had periods before and they will recover.”
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel the same way – but we need to move forward.
We really need the support of Celtic because that way the players get better.
It is very important that we remain united now.
Warburton's Caution About January Transfers
Despite comments just weeks ago that suggested he had identified some targets for the January transfers, Rangers chief Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he doesn’t want to affect the Ibrox unit.
The former head of Brentford said: “The January transfer period is very different from the summer period.”
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is the pre-season period in which they can be integrated, which you could see this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players that aren’t needed.
Celtic targets Michu after retreat
Swansea striker Michu, who was associated with Celtic during the transfers, suggested that he might withdraw on the expiry of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled with ankle problems for two years and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts clashes with SFA over Neilson's comments
Hearts drove 2-1 when Paterson was knocked out and lost 3-2, but the backer's red card was then canceled - the third red card canceled in eight months.
Neilson keeps his statement, insisting, “We didn’t question integrity, we didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was picked up after admitting he played a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
“It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment,” the striker said, adding, “There’s no need to say I’m not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for the Celtic.”
Tannadice Council has confidence in Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United’s board still trusts the management team will change the situation – but he agrees the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We will bring the boys back into shape,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for 'dirty victory' over Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team must cling desperately to Hamilton Accies for their seventh successive league victory, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic due to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or league, and has not won matches like that."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as UK rises
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, at 164,000 in May-July, while the number of the UK’s total unemployed increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than in the UK, at 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% – a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scotland’s Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term authorities’ plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It’s been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with the employment rate increasing and the unemployment rate falling.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for late legal intervention, I will watch a man be sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll sit in an observer room in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary's execution room and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, I’m terrified of it.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It’s true, journalists can witness executions in America and, because usually the demands exceed the number of available seats, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The elect will view the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, plus I developed my own connection to him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two-and-a-half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to have a blanket and a pen to write down what I see.
I'll have to try and remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he wants, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he “could have formulated better,” but he still thinks I’m wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it if he asked me to.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he wants to be present an international report to write about the subject.
He believes that if he dies, publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that we have made.
I will not go back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I am sure there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend I'm totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you will learn what it's like to watch a man you like die worthless.
Peter Moody claims the Stewarians tried to spy on him and threatens to pull out of the race
Peter Moody claimed that the Victorian stewarzi Racing or tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to immediately retire from racing.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the removal of Lady Tatai from the race due to treatment given on race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do the best for the racing field and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari’s cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about the spies' statements and did not want to resemble "the vulture that does not reach the grapes".
“I wasn’t going to say anything about that, and I’ve been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all blew up all at once,” Moody said.
It is known that he continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have stated.
Tonight I will go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that I strive to give them the best.
From the moment they begin to think that this is not the case, you have to give up the trainer job.
At that point I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he said that the integrity department had been trying to spy on his stables.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room next to a man – whose name I’ll tell him if I’m asked – and offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there,” Moody told Racing.com.
Of course, he considers me a cheater.
If so, then they should resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at the time and so on.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for the RVL to start having a backbone and can it hold people outside the trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe they all see the others.
Maybe he has to take my license and put me aside, and I have no doubt that the statements I make now could cause him to think about this variant.
But I’ve reached the point where I don’t care anymore and that saddens me.
It makes me very sad.
I will put pressure on them and cause them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer’s frustration grew with the lengthy cobalt testing investigation involving Leaders and the removal prompted him to state that he could “put his license on the table.”
Moody, whose name is most often associated with coaching undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the race day treatment rule as “ridiculous” after a mud or clay pod was applied to the horses’ legs, which violated the rules.
It violates the rules of the races.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which happened.
It happened on race day.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment on race day consisting of applying the poultice, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the crash site in Cobram has been arrested.
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by an escape from the crash site.
The biker was transported by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he was seriously injured after being hit Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley Highway.
Police said the driver did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to Shepparton police.
He appears to be charged with fleeing from the scene of the accident, failing to provide first aid and other road crimes.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to opponents in the wrestling charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called the criticism of the plating tactics used by his team as "distorted subjects" brought into question by the two main NRL favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm players to "take the shots" in Storm's nervously won qualifying game at Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying match played on Saturday night when he called the match a rugby league "demo" and said the two Queensland teams weren't very good at wr.
Bellamy jumped in defense of the plating tactic approached by his team and said the players were simply focusing on “contact” when they were plating.
Bellamy says she gained confidence after two top coaches criticized her team, meaning they were worried that Storm would defeat them.
"And things don't stop here - we didn't hear Trent Robinson complaining about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything in our defensive systems or techniques all year, so much so that in the last six weeks we have really focused on contact in the plates and so we have changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so he’s probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
Funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football," reminding his mentor, the St. George-Illawarra Dragons, that they won the championship in 2010 by playing "plicistive" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was.”
I remember in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he wasn’t even interested in black under the nail.
But now he has a team that can play what I would consider exciting football, especially because of the fast young midfielders.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat worried about the match with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn’t think about us when they were thinking about important matches.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm vs. Roosters match was a more severe score-related match compared to the Broncos vs. Cowboys match.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven't seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, does that mean exciting game?
Or is it exciting to take breaks and not mark?
For me, it's plans.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we might meet them.
Storm is free this weekend as they have earned the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday’s AAMI Park preliminary final, with tickets going on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls’ phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl’s phone to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone when she was sleeping and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as their subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg’s hand while he was sleeping.
He looked in the phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
After arriving, the police saw the five photos and then analyzed the computers found at that address and found “worrying” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of children.
Hogg claimed to have done it to “attract pedophiles” to the Internet before they “pretend he’s a cop to scare them away.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the court in Dundee: "He said it's an addiction - that he's addicted to scaring people.
He admitted he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to give himself up as a cop to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent the pictures and that he had asked the person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to lure.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and wants to see images of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When the little girl found the messages on the phone, she shouted at her mother and shook and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, 23-year-old Hogg, domiciled in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to allegations of making or taking indecent photos of child subjects, and violated conditional release conditions on January 25 this year and failed to appear in court on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim has called for Hogg not to be registered in the sex offender registry because it can be said that this crime “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody before appearances for other cases.
He was placed in the sex offender registry before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, delivers national speech to parliament
Earlier this year, Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
He was not injured, but the filming of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said they received anonymous death threats, threatening not to sue Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they huided him during his speech in Parliament – a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said many opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, warning them not to disrupt Mugabe’s speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number, but it's titled 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
They warn parliamentarians in question that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "worried" about threats passed on to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 layoffs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs as part of the company’s restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the service sector.
This year, HP will split into two companies, separating its computer and printer divisions from its fast-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected bids will cost about $2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure,” said Meg Whitman, HP’s president and CEO, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to the new way of doing business,” Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing needs of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and will “focus on delivering unrivalled integrated solutions” to companies.
A company was founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, whose electric equipment production activity and whose Palo Alto garage was called the "Silicon Valley Hedgehog".
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus better in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: The comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching the peak of the past 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to rise to this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students experiencing symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood,” his chances of recovery double.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends halves the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to work, it must first be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style rather than substance, the immediate character of the response often takes precedence over contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality isolation is what dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values – our inner desire for personal development and friendship – that further profoundly affect our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn’t really buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused attention on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of watching football in the comfortable chairs, and Ross’ passion for Rachel came from the fact that men are known to associate with this situation, even though they often shy away from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: “My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who turn to us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to deal with yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more mechanisms of long-term psychological adaptation.
The series highlights the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps objective, external intervention through the phone, people come in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you’re attending this weekend at Comedy Central’s FriendsFest, with the full set of film sets to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is aired by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of the ?FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG set Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG win against the Swedish team Malmo.
Here’s the story of the game and how to get out of the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their homework, Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League series, with a soothing 2-0 victory over Malmo in the match played on Tuesday at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his Champions League debut in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage of many who missed a series of occasions before securing their advantage with the Cavani goal in the 61st minute.
Arriving in Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the optimus but also to improve the course to the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting the opportunity to score a goal after which he was replaced by the team in his hometown and the club at which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or on the move in the Champions League, so the 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference from the next class, even if there are still aspects that we need to perfect throughout the season,” Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I’m sorry we couldn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury to one of three changes in Paris, with a 2-2 home draw from Bordeaux in League One this weekend, but Di Maria took over the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he churned at Marco Verratti’s pass behind Malmo’s defense before striking incredibly over Johan Wiland in the long right-hand corner of the gate.
But if anyone expected PSG to win by snapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team starters, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, with the exception of Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed down several times, making a few unnecessary passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five tries in the first half alone and was then replaced by Cavani just after the game resumed.
However, Ibrahimovic proved much better at supporting his colleagues, his pass being the one that Di Maria sent in a shot diverted by Wiland over the gate in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's centering.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hope that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop for Wiland's distance for rejecting David Luiz held the final score before new incoming Ezequiel Lavezzi was canceled a goal in prolongations.
Malmo's Norwegian coach, Age Hareide, later stated that PSG were with a class over and that "The last match we played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I have only played in the Swedish league, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Down with the hat for PSG.
They played an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in stock sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodity exchange, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a massive debt reduction plan.
The London-listed company Glencore said it had sold new shares worth 1.6 billion pounds to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is taking a hit with falling prices on the commodity exchange, as China’s decline in economic activity influences demand and causes disaster in markets.
The preferential subscription right increased the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning trades.
Shares rose 2.77% to 131.60 shillings on the FTSE 100 index, which opened at 0.69% higher.
Glencore has unveiled the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 shillings per share, down 2.4 percent from Tuesday’s closing price.
It took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concerns about the growth of China’s protracted stagnant economy led to substantial increases in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell 20-40%.
Xi urges wider expansion of global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy needs to open up to the outside world to fuel growth.
“China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving opening policies,” Xi said at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and make room for economic growth, Xi said.
The steering group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, easing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital, and reorganising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify the sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and providing wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be open to private investment.
“State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-invested companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called “green cards”, optimizing the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right of practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Trade unions in education, dissatisfied with the government’s proposal to raise wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the education unions have not reached any result, with the government proposing a wage increase of 10%, from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted an increase of 15%, from November, or one of 20%, from December.
The talks took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, the prime minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
Today’s government proposal did not please us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to summon the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent promised to us today is less for us than we expected.
“In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have in our agreement with the government last year for 2016,” Anton Hadar, Alma Mater’s president, said at the end of the talks.
In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have.
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI in which the representatives of the Government will also participate to present to the representatives of the confederations of the country the proposal of salary increase, followed by the unionists to decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The Prime Minister also told unionists that the government is trying to send the Payroll Act to Parliament as quickly as possible so that it can enter into force on December 1.
The normative act foresees the increase of salaries in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, an increase foreseen in the document to be made staggered, in the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised unionists the full acquittal of judges in 2016.
Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkey’s territorial waters on Tuesday after their boat sank.
Among the victims were 11 women and 5 children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coastguard said it had rescued 249 people in the shipwrecked boat, but their nationality was not yet known.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Over the weekend, 34 migrants, including four babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometers off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The route has become a popular one lately for immigrants who want to escape war and hard life from countries like Syria or Iraq.
More than 100 stewardesses fired because they were too fat
Air India is laying off about 130 stewardi and stewardess for being overweight, the airline said late last week.
The state-run company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics said the move was "ridiculous" and "shockingly sexist."
Mass dismissal is the latest in a ten-year struggle between the company and the more crowded stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began using graphics with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India dismissed the new stewardess as "exceptionally overweight", as this "may have an effect on reflexes and may impede the agility needed to carry out emergency measures".
The Stewardesses sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
“All efforts to get them to lose weight failed,” explained a company spokesman.
A footballer from the Star gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision did he make?
A footballer from Star gives lessons to Gigi Becali regarding the promotion of young players.
If the funder of the champion decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, the founder Paul Papp opened a football school.
"Paul Papp" Academy will operate in Dej city, with the deserts of the town being awaited for a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to give the start to the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having to worry about training materials.
They have to have only one care: to play football as best as possible.
Technical details don’t have to be their concern.
They have to value their talent.

Children up to the age of 11 are expected to attend the Academy of Starfunds.
The whole party wants government.
The interim president of the PSD Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta expects this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants the government, the whole party.
If we wish to formalize by a decision of Congress, we will do so as well.
There won't be any emotion in this.
“There were no elements, no voices in the party, no opinions in the party that would give someone the insecurity of the government or give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in the government, in the current government, with the current prime minister,” Dragnea said at the end of the meeting of the PSD’s Permanent National Bureau.
PSD announces when Congress will be held - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that at the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, a clear message be given whether the government is to continue or if the party decides to go into opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce on Monday if I will run for Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he candidacy for a leadership position at the upcoming Congress.
I will be weighing Monday by the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is also set.
“I will announce if I will run for office in the leadership of the party,” Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday’s session of the PSD’s National Permanent Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation in announcing the candidacy had anything to do with his file, Dragnea said he did not have this problem.
I don’t have the issue you’re referring to, but I think it’s fair and honest to all of my colleagues in the party to announce whether or not I’m going to run at the time of the formal date of Congress.
“It’s the only motivation,” Dragnea said.
The vast majority of Social Democratic affiliates proposed extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of Congress will be decided Monday by the party’s Executive Committee.

Italian Man Arrested at Bors Customs with Immigrants Hidden in TIR
Two Sri Lankan citizens were spotted Monday at the customs office of Bors as they tried to cross the border illegally, hiding in the semi-trailer of an Italian-led freighter.
Based on research, it was determined that the two were paying the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the border police said.
At the specific checkpoint, border guards noticed a large bag of personal belongings for several people in the cabin of the truck, which is why they carried out a thorough check on the means of transport.
On this occasion, border guards discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the freighter, among the plastic crates, two male persons.
Two men, aged 28, are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
"In the investigations, the young people said they intended to arrive in France, which is why they contacted a co-national, through which they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they would receive 2,000 euros per person," the border police said in a statement.
The two migrants were asked to do “criminal work in the face of sacrificing the crime of attempting to fraudulently cross the state border”.
Pompeo B., the 45-year-old Italian citizen driving a Romanian-registered Renault Magnum truck carrying plastic casings for a company in Italy, was detained for 24 hours, to be presented to the Bihor Tribunal with a proposal for preventive arrest.
How satisfied are the Romans in the couple: Men versus women
Most Romanians are happy with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study carried out on the occasion of the coming to Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents said they were “very satisfied” and “satisfied” with the overall quality of the relationship.
“However, 18 percent look ‘slightly dissatisfied’ and ‘very dissatisfied’ in the relationship, and another 18 percent say ‘suitable,’” the study’s conclusion reads.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% suitable, 6% very dissatisfied and 8% slightly dissatisfied.
For women, 33% said they were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
As for the neutral state, we see a difference of two percent.
"As in the highly unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference is the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 percent," the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romans (26%) spend an hour or less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
According to the study, “Romans need a little more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), security (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, trust 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 1%.”
The study was conducted by Extreme Training between June 1st and September 1st on 1,369 people, the calculated margin of error being 2.6%.
Europe has once again become embarrassed.
German Deputy Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe "has become ashamed" after Monday's ministerial meeting in Brussels failed to allocate refugees within the European Union.
"Last night (Monday night), Europe was once again ashamed," Sigmar Gabriel, who is also the economy minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, told AFP.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested cutting EU structural funds in the event of countries rejecting refugee quotas.
European Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday, failed to reach an agreement on the mandatory deployment of 120,000 refugees, which the European Commission requested last week to tackle one of the worst migration crises in Europe since 1945.
He was mayor for only half an hour.
The interim mayor of Tuzla municipality in Constanta County enjoyed only half an hour of this function, because of the DNA prosecutors.
Taner Resit had been appointed to head the town, instead of the former mayor, Constantin Micu, who was convicted of embezzlement, B1 TV reported.
The prefect of the county, Ion Constantin, waited for him at the headquarters of the institution to make the official announcement, at 4 p.m., but he did not arrive.
The reason?

After two and a half hours of hearings, he was detained for 24 hours.
As a result, he was mayor for only 30 minutes.
According to prosecutors, he is accused of blackmailing a businessman between August 16 and September 8, in complicity with Stefan Radu, a boss who wanted to get 48,000 euros from him, shows the truth.
The two threatened the administrator, drove out his clients, blocked their access to his store, changed locks and seized the company’s assets.
Moreover, on September 8, Stefan Radu would have beaten the administrator in the presence of the deputy mayor.
Thousands of people came to give him a candle.
Thousands of people have passed through the coffin with the dead body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people are no longer at St George's Church than at the sanctification of the lake or at the Great Feast of St Nicholas, parish priest Emil Caramizaru said on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people of all ages wait in a row, stretching from the entrance of the church to the side streets, to pass the catafal on which stands the coffin with the dead body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor.
People wait about an hour to reach the Church of St. George New, where groups of 40 people enter.
About 300 people per hour passed Wednesday at the coffin with the dead body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor.
Thousands of people from Bucharest, but also from Cluj, Baia Mare, Iasi, Constanta and Craiova have come, since Tuesday, to pay homage to Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people have had only the 300-year sanctification of the church and the Great Shrine of Saint Nicholas.
"Cornelius Vadim Tudor has been at the church's 300-year sanctification and stood with the members of the Holy Synod, Blessed Daniel and representatives of the five patriarchs who participated in the sanctification," said Emil Caramizaru, parish priest of the church in the capital.
According to him, the people came with flowers and candles in their hands, sitting nicely and waiting in line, like on a big religious holiday.
It is extraordinary the behavior of these people, they sit politely, with dignity, children, the elderly, people in carcasses, as if they were at a great religious holiday.
“It’s exciting to see them waiting to worship and pay a final tribute to Vadim Tudor,” said parish priest Emil Caramizaru.
According to him, at the request of the family of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, the church will remain open on the night from Wednesday to Thursday, the last night being closed at 01:00 and reopened in the morning at 07:00.

The parish priest pointed out that Vadim Tudor often came to this church, especially in the evening, after 8 p.m., and then asked him to open the racle with the relics of St. Nicholas and remained to pray for minutes in the row.
He came here very often, usually in the evening, after 8 p.m., he asked me to open the door with the relics of St. Nicoale and prayed.
He said it was a great blessing for this church of Brancoveanu.
He told me, "More brother Emil, think that here were Brancoveanu, Eminescu, Mihai Viteazul, who carried the hand of Saint Nicholas."
“You know what a blessing this country is,” Vadim said to me.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor is due to be buried Thursday at Ghencea Civil Cemetery with military honors.
The Senate leadership on Tuesday rejected the request of Corneliu Vadim Tudor’s wife that the coffin with the former senator’s body be deposited in the lobby of the Legislative Chamber.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor was born on November 28, 1949 in Bucharest, was a writer, politician and journalist.
He was the founder of the Romanian Grand Party, a former member of the European Parliament and a former senator.
What's Happening to Coach Darren Cahill
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, having to choose whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year in the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian coach being alongside the Romanian only at major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise to Cahill, who seems the only coach who managed to impose himself in the face of the capricious sport.
The Adidas program will end later this year, and Halep must decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or give up the collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's gonna happen yet.
We talk and see.
“After Singapore I will be able to give an answer,” Simona told a news conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, asking for a contract of about a million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession that he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last race Simona and Cahill will work on together is the Champions Tournament in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with the Romanian national team last fall.
The former selector confessed that he did not get along with FRF President Razvan Burleanu after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national.
He eventually proposed to the head of the Federation to raise his salary substantially to stay, but was refused.
I'm not sorry I left the national team.
Then I was sorry, leaving a job behind.
That’s how I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector was not normal, I was not respected, my work was not respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he did not know me, he learned different opinions from the press about me.
It didn’t change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results we had, plus the financial situation in the middle.
I continued the work, everything went very well and probably his ideas changed as well.
But I wanted to go.
If I wanted to stay, I proposed a contract extension.
We have about 400 and a few thousand euros a year, I was going to have about 600,000 euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.
“He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group,” said Victor Piturca at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last fall, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminary round.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.
Armored and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns at the Serbian border after violent clashes on Wednesday when they used water and tear gas cannons against migrants who wanted to enter Serbia, despite the fact that Hungary had erected a fence with barbed wire.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far, 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has picked up two children who were injured after they were thrown over the security fence.
“We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary’s security by all means,” said Hungarian Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi.
The police tried to control with their water and tear gas cannons the multitude of people throwing with plastic bottles, stones and pieces of flooring.
Authorities reported that dozens of migrants broke the fence as they crossed the towns of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has called on Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants at the border.
There are reports that the Serbians supplemented their law enforcement at the border.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest suspended crossing the Roszke-Horgos border for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted action to close its borders to secure access for immigrants.
If on Tuesday he announced that besides the barbed wire fence at the border with Serbia he would also raise one at the border with Romania, to the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday the Hungarian Prime Minister announced the raising of a fence at the border with Croatia.
The rare disease a man suffers from
American Nick Hess was haunted by his family as an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely stand, and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he did not drink alcohol, it was apparent that he was drunk.
When she first accused me of being drunk without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
“But friends and family thought, ‘Maybe he’s drinking alone, he’s an alcoholic in secret,’” he said.
When he saw the footage of his wife with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, simply did not recognize himself: “I was looking into my eyes and I wasn’t there.”
“It was awful, I remembered nothing.”
In addition, his wife, who, although she doubted him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breathing also smelled of alcohol.
Nick’s biggest thought came when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, he was found to have alcoholemia three times the legal limit, though the night before he had only consumed one beer.
After years of unnumbered investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, Auto-brewery syndrome.
Basically, the body causes all the carbohydrates consumed to ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected that this might be Nick's illness was his own wife.
The disease hasn’t been cured yet, but since he gave up carbohydrates, Nick hasn’t had such episodes.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club.
A South Korean man destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of his dealer’s services.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be knocked out, BT reports.
The entire scene was filmed, and the clip reached the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed the car had life-threatening flaws.
His anger came when the dealer from whom he bought the car did not solve his problem, as he had agreed.
On Wednesday, the government approved the “National Strategy on Immigration for 2015-2018” and the “Action Plan for the current year”, documents considered to be “another stage that Romania is going through as part of efforts to modernize the process of managing immigration in the national territory”, according to a press release.
The strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action that reflect policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
Considering the problems faced by the countries in Romania’s immediate vicinity, measures are being considered for the uniform and coherent management of the situations caused by the possible influx of illegal immigrants into Romania, generated by crisis situations of a political, social, economic or military nature.
“The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay particular attention to citizens coming from states with potential migration or that can undermine national security,” the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reviving the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets several general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls of the legality of the residence of citizens of third countries on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the territory of Romania for third-party citizens who meet the needs of employment, facilitating access for citizens of third countries to higher education institutions in Romania for the areas and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government considers that it is "a means of establishing concrete activities that will lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing phenomenon of migration".
Romania, in a European top job market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria saw the largest increase in total labour costs among EU Member States in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to employers’ personnel expenditures.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total cost of labour rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania ranks third in the EU to increase labour cost
The highest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where the hourly labour cost fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance of labour costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase of the hourly labour cost in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly labor cost.
Report of activity of the TVR management, rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risked dismissal
The Parliament’s Culture Committees on Wednesday rejected the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014.
To reject the report, 17 MPs voted, one against rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Bureaus.
They will probably decide next week.
At the next plenary meeting it will be discussed.
“I think given this situation it will be done relatively quickly,” said the president of the Senate Culture Committee, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was common sense" for the TVR leadership to be present at this meeting, as no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was common sense to have the TVR leadership present because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to CA members as early as last night, about an hour before we knew the time either, but today, after the meeting of the Bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I believe that at the time you are summoned, you are a budget employee, paid from public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the committees gathered even if you do not like it alive.
"Because it's your duty to work, you're in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of Parliament's Culture Committees.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw as they continued, came with the idea that this year would be up to date, but they did not pay off from the historical ones.
"I would remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else's fault that this was lost with the banks and the tax, these are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report is rejected by the plenary meeting there will be elections for a new Board of Directors, and it will elect the director general of the institution.
I don’t know who will be nominated for this position.
Miracles will not be done.
The important thing is to make political decisions for this institution to work.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, by their vote will choose with much reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don’t know who he will be, if you ask me what qualities he must have – good sense in his attitude towards employees because it’s a mess of petitions coming from employees, complaints, layoffs.
“When you get 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we’re talking about the financial situation that’s a disaster,” he said.
Although he did not appear in Parliament, TVR’s president-general, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he asked that Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to the saving and guaranteeing of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of the TV fee.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to the TV fee indexing, the amendment and completion of HG 978/2003 on the public television service fee, for the purpose of updating the provisions on up-to-date technological changes, as well as for the regulation of the procedure on TV fee control and the finding of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision that provides for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv’s agents for the collection of the TV fee, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a maximum limit of 5% of the commission from collections.
Stelian Tanase asks for the reduction of the VAT rate for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution to the CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also the amendment of Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budget / finance allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - World Football Championship, Golden Deer, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will go into incapacity for payment in the coming months considering that labor legislation obliges the employer to enforce judicial decisions, even if they are not final, and wage rights are honored with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has been constantly striving to cut staff and TV production costs.
“Thus, travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July, TVR News was shut down,” the letter said.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by one’s own efforts.
"Without the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will sooner or later be unable to carry out its public mission," the letter said.
The Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
Vasile Blaga’s daughters brought to trial
Vasile Blaga’s juniors, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was brought to trial on Wednesday by prosecutors at the Bucharest Court of Appeals.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a case with damage of about 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on 22 May.
He founded Axis Corporate Security SRL, along with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga’s daughter, Agathe.
The investigations showed that, for the purpose of evading taxes and taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specialized in providing security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been highlighted.
“In fact, in the company’s accounting there would have been recorded fictitious purchases of services, which, in reality, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by about 600,000 euros,” the Romanian police explained in a press release.
The Seychelles have determined the fate of Sanmartean.
Al-Ittihad’s team has decided the fate of middleman Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean’s separation from Ittihad is imminent, Ladislaus Boloni’s manager, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will never happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the match starter and does it well.
The Seci have also realized that he is the best and that it would be wrong if they gave him up.
There would have been another, much better player, but nothing came out.
“There were more discussions, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing materialized,” Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was elected vice president of the Court of Auditors.
Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, there were 290 votes “for” and 108 “against”.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The NLP representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 informs.
Moreover, the liberals have criticized Sarbu’s appointment in this position and have announced that they will challenge her at the CCR, provided he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics.
The PSD Senator will hold the position of Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, which remained free after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is set to play a chef in the film Burnt, the actor has made a revelation his fans didn’t expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up in the kitchen: “I worked most of my life as a cook.”
He revealed that he had worked in the kitchen since he was 15 years old, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, and then, in college, he continued on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so the whole childhood cooked with the Italian grandmother, according to ContactMusic.
Asked what his future plans were at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man who would make five-year plans, “not even for two.”
“It’s not motivating for me to have a map,” he said.
“I have dreams, things you would laugh at if I told you,” he said, adding that what he had wanted since childhood had come true.
At the age of 40, the actor admitted that he sees himself in the near future as director, taking on the role of Clint Eastwood, who also took over at that age.
Ponta accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned Prime Minister Victor Ponta’s claims on Wednesday morning that Hungary’s political decision-makers are “nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing.”
“Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational claims, offends the whole of Hungary,” he said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
“His remarks have only one explanation: he has totally lost his support in Romania’s domestic politics,” the head of Hungarian diplomacy added.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention and sanction the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, “are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union.”
I do not want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives.
“These are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and to the anti-Semitic attitudes, and to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!”
The Romanian prime minister added that he is adept at rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, arguing that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are no better political decision makers than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees are fleeing!
“I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values – what we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction precisely with these objectives and values!”
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called the remarks by Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Hungary’s handling of the refugee crisis “merely a lie,” saying the claims were inappropriate for a 21st-century leader.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the "extremist and lying remarks" of the Romanian prime minister are related to the domestic political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest awaits an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and always say is that I am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are medieval nonsense and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can receive more, we will receive, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with bats and inserts.
“I don’t agree with that,” the head of the Romanian executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government in Budapest has decided to start preparations on the ground for the extension of the fence he is building on the border with Serbia, to face a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Prime Minister Victor Ponta later said Hungary's decision to erect a border fence solved nothing of the refugee problem and "take Hungary out of Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Meccan crane?
Saudi Arabia's Binladin Group, which belongs to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible" for the downing of a crane at the Great Mosque in Mecca on Friday, in which 107 people died.
According to an investigative committee, the company has "failed to comply with safety rules," the Saudi news agency (SPA) reported.
The company’s executives were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden’s father 80 years ago and is now run by former terrorist leader Bakr’s brother.
Binladen Group has been working for four years to expand the Great Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday evening during a storm when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong wind gusts, collapsed on the eastern side of the roof of the Great Mosque in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How he closed the mouths of the protesters
Considered by many to be the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi has been labeled, after retiring from activity, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to achieve performance in the new posture.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he sponsors.
A year after taking over the team, the King has demonstrated that he is able to turn a team fighting for rescue from retrograde into a top team.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, fighting in the European Cups.
Things took an even better turn for the future this season as the team came in second in League One with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League One with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double the Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and lately names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea appeared in the starting team.
The club’s policy has made the Future a follow-up team for teams abroad, so Hagi sold this summer 1.5 million euros – Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina – 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari – 500,000 euros).
Alongside the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to the Trade Register data.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played like a small country.
It’s a legitimate strategy, but then you can’t ask to be treated as the EU’s seventh country.
Big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the governing college of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with newspaper.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come".
But there are masses that have started and we can’t turn history around.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best as possible and adapt them to us.
According to Cristian Ghinea, we are in an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the situation now."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council that has, in fact, solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All the predictions said they would have the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity was applied in the JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, that is 16 that represent 65% of the EU population.
Calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go before.
Because it’s a sensitive issue, there have been rejection reactions right in Germany against Chancellor Merkel’s opening policy and they didn’t want it to appear in many countries as an “EU sends migrants on our heads”.
They have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because obviously this wave is creating a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably see major changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory quotas have not really been eliminated, but the subject has just been left to cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of the external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of the members who are on the Schengen external border to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece’s border with Turkey is also Germany’s border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has set the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be abandoned, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece is overturned, you can’t say endlessly that it’s Greece’s business.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, is it possible to solve it without a precise, even mandatory, mechanism for sharing the effort of reception?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they will get to them.
Because there is a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don’t think European states will take up the migrants: you’re going to Country X or Country Y.
There will probably be some unique filtration centers in Greece or Turkey where asylum applications will be processed.
They are working on solutions like this.
But the problem does not have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
The truth is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just started to leave for Europe.
One estimate says that only 10 percent have left, winter is hard to get past the Mediterranean, but we expect next year to see a wave that may be even greater.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, we will not look at it as catastrophic in the media anymore.
Talk about countries with less or more experience.
Does it seem to you that there is any place where the integration of large groups from an extra-European culture has really succeeded?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they are still enclaved.
I would not go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that doesn’t mean they don’t integrate at all.
It remains an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, and the UK.
But purely political means will not work.
Create fortress Europe and illusory.
It must be applied to the mechanisms of integration in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take on the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and with one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family including through marriages of convenience.
But the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we have to look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean that the country will be rebuilt overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions emerge, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls have been erected, border checks have been reintroduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in jeopardy?
The European project as such, no, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where these migrants first set foot.
I mean, we're free to move around, but everyone's got their own problems.
In the face of such a wave it can not be like this, because some countries do not cope.
When there are waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run, it doesn’t change much.
After the attacks in France, we don’t have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It’s a wave of public excitement that settles in both directions.
And it’s so unstable from week to week that you can’t make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of belligerent statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public opinion is excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real European market.
And I do not believe that Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the current situation.
How has Romania played in this crisis so far?
Like a small country that thinks that if it pulls its cap on its eyes and stuffs its ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not your problem of the small country.
That’s what we did, it’s a legitimate strategy, but then you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh country in the EU.
You're not, you're not playing big country.
Big countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanians’ appetite for Schengen will decrease greatly.
President Iohannis says it may be good that we haven't already entered.
So we move from desperation to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen so that migrants see us as an alternative route.
This does not mean that we are no longer in Schengen, but that we are more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become a common responsibility, there will be unique rules of acceptance of migrants, unique rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its attention to Syria, no one died.
Is there a link between the two outbreaks, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrating power behavior.
She believes that being great power means confusing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial efforts of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to fall apart before his main opponent was the Islamic State.
A couple of years ago, there was a struggle between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias, backed by Gulf countries and Westerners.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that it cannot shut down.
But you are only great power if you have solutions.
Off-side play is just a strategy to gain time.
Putin is probably waiting for offers to be made, to press the buttons to solve the situation.
Offerings don’t come because the world isn’t convinced that he can sort out some of the things that he himself creates.
But I don't agree with theories that these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see him any stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the “Like” button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, the “Dislike”.
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, the New York Times reports.
Zuckerberg said the “Dislike” button will show a nuance of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on his account or a major event in his life, and someone else will “dislike” it.
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathize with something sad.
Zuckerberg said it was not comfortable for people to “like” current events, such as the refugee crisis, or the death of a family member.
“You may not feel comfortable giving that post a Like,” the Facebook representative said.
The new Facebook button hasn’t been well received by everyone.
"There's already enough hate on Facebook and social media," Haneef said on the New York Times' Facebook page.
"I'm going to dislike the dislike button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, said there was nothing wrong with the button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it’s hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign is approaching in America, and the “Dislike” button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary on Tuesday accepted only 70 migrants, a handful of thousands coming in en masse to its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia because of the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it would build a fence on its border with Romania.
The move drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
“As you can see, this is totally different,” Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Prior to the imposition of new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said Monday.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to get to the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the county council is about to collapse.
Two companies in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are about to fall apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The seat of the County Council in Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up tearing itself down.
A year and a half after the consolidation and redevelopment of the building should have been completed, the works did not reach half.
A final stage in the building’s epic took place last day, when the National Council for Dispute Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract for the realization of the technical project for the remaining works to be carried out.
The initial project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the manufacturer and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company was to update the technical project, and then a new auction for the works was organized.
“Negotiations did not end with a contract, however, as CJ felt that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution,” said Răzvan Timofciuc, public relations representative at CJ.
CJ’s decision to discontinue direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Iesan court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the decision of the CNSC to the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it can be considered finding another designer.
Thus, work on the consolidation of the building could be resumed at the earliest next year.
Our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Department began in 2011.
A first construction contract was terminated in April 2012, after 4.5 million lei works had been carried out.
The tender was resumed and the contract was awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
The work has so far been done in a proportion of about 50%.
Initially, the works of consolidation, redevelopment and mansarding of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
"Ready, say it all!" - statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the Cadastre Office signed an agreement recognizing the facts, against delayed imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, in front of the former boss, Narcisa Nedelcu
A counselor at the Office of Real Estate Cadastre and Advertising (OCPI) Iași accused of DNA in a corruption file has admitted to fap tele.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dasălu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Tribunal, the judges deciding to give a solution in this case on September 29th.
Dumitru Daniel Dascalu was accused of intellectual falsification in a continuing form and agreed to execute two years in jail with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to the facts charged to Dascălu, the prosecutors specified that they, as advisors of the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, "formed falsely several acceptance minutes, selling the services contracts in the previous package by O.C.P.I. Iași with the directors of the companies SC Gauss and Top S.C.
Last days, the former head of the Office, Narcisa Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OCPI were put on trial in this file, the accusations being the settlement of services to the aforementioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
The trial price exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and preparing the women’s handball national team for Olympic qualification costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania’s national women’s handball team, “the main objective is qualifying for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for that they have to go through two stages of caudine forks, first the World Championship and second the prequalification tournament,” Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of six or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masori, goalkeeper coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to qualify for some things, specifically materials for physical training, which we never heard of.
These all to get to the Olympics. and I'll do whatever it takes for me to have them.
It’s a big investment, it’s a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because at the moment we are in the stone age with preparation.
“The teams we’ve been battling with have these materials and have had them for some time,” said Dedu, who said he was trying to get the amounts needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The FRH president also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
There is no room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure issue and it is shameful to be challenged to a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let’s not forget that in other corners of the world, entire Olympic neighborhoods have been built in an interval of two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona there was a garbage dump, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success in terms of investments.
“In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition,” Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me, it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civilized with a project, people gave their consent in principle, but it became very quickly clear that the hall would never be built.
I also had discussions with EHF, I told them that we wanted to, that we were able to organize and they said that they agreed and to invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we talk concretely.
“So we have all the openness, and at EHF and IHF, but we don’t have the infrastructure,” the FRH official explained.
The former great handballer avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all the coaches to be reserved in the forecasts, that if they do not fulfill they will turn against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian Rugby Players Debut on September 23, Against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday, in a press conference, that all the components of the Romanian lot are prepared for the matches of the World Cup in England, where he hopes to achieve two victories: "We are prepared".
Both I and my colleagues are on top of the engines.
We trained to give the best performance in all four matches.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let’s take it easy, first with France and then we’ll see.
But if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the crowning of so many years of work.
I don’t want to disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with great results.
“We want you to be proud that players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor,” Macovei said.
The national team of Romania, Lynn Howells, who had his first experience as a World Cup coach, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I’m sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it is very important that every match I make the Romanians be proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraș, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made in the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am confident that we will be at the height of the event.
“These guys started playing in Romania’s teams at the age of 18-19, so there’s cohesion, there’s a band of friends, who set out to make a dream come true,” Dumitraș said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will play in Group D, with the following matches scheduled: with France on September 23 in London; with Ireland on September 27 in London; with Canada on October 6 in Leicester; with Italy on October 11 in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday at London's Twickenham Stadium with the England - Fiji Group A match.

14 million lei gives to the Hospital "St. Spiridon" in Ia and to the budget correction
What will be purchased with this large amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget correction, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit has received to use by the end of the year will be invested in modernization and arrangement of some clinics, but also in medical equipment and technique for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgery, six beds of ATI equipped properly, ophthalmic microscope and other apparatus necessary for the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and arrangement of the "Great Burnt".
From the money from the budget correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section.
“In addition, in the coming days we will be receiving work from the walkway linking the UPU to the clinics of cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology to ensure the transport in decent conditions of the patient from the UPU to the neighboring clinics,” explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have in the courtyard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tatărați, which it will organize in the ambulatory, in the same way as it currently works.
The clinic will operate in the area where the ambulatory allergy, hematology and endocrinology are located and will have about 30 beds.
The lake, ridiculed by RATP controllers and a flyer.
The Passion of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
From the experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to walk in your city again.
Unwillingly, they were struck by the erroneous information in the leaflets, by the nonsensicalness of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, by a fine "as the law says".
The husbands arrived in Iași a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Center and asked for tourist brochures.
They also received a pamphlet with the RATP trails.
"Armed" with these maps, the husbands visited the lake.
But two days ago, in the Cupou, they wanted to get to the Palas Mall.
Because there was no ticket tone at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they could get the ticket via SMS.
No one told them this service no longer exists.
Confident in the flyer, they got on a bus and tried to text after the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said there had been no service for two years and that it had been announced in the press that it had been cancelled.
Where do I know what was written in the local press, coming the night before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation to them, they said they don't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all they can do is give us a single fine instead of two (me and my wife).
“I paid, I didn’t want to spoil my day to visit the gendarmerie and give statements there!” says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of erroneous information on the leaflet and controllers who “applied the law to blood.”
It's not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about the money, I'm not too many, but the point is, I felt wrong.
Bad luck for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in pre-trial detention.
The trial of the six rapists in Vaslui moved yesterday to the Iasi Court of Appeal.
The judges tried the first trial in a non-public hearing in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Before the actual commencement of the hearing, one of the judges from Exe to whom the file had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The magistrate was active until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the president of the Nale Section, he being the one who, on April 9, admitted a challenge formulated by four of the defendants, ordering their placement in house arrest.
Currently, the case is being tried by a full body of magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file he formulated an abstention and Judge Dan An ton, on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubinage relationship with one of the rapists’ lawyers.
The two judges decided that the rapists in Vaslui should remain in pre-trial detention.
The Negroes will remain in prison for at least another 30 days, when the jude cavities will rediscuss the possibility of their release.
The next trial will take place at the Iasi Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Iasi Court of Appeal, the van carrying the rapists from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the Păcurari district, the car entering Iasi by belt.
The Iveco van with which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volkswagen car exiting the Canta street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van runs from the end of the truck.
The car entered Iași this way because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iași to the stables, then on the belt road.
They shortened the road a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the arrested escort called for another transport to pick up the prisoners.
Soon after, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the maximum security penitentiary in Iași, which took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the nest mask, and the arrests went off in speed, two by two.
“The incident was not reported to the police because the drivers of the two car doors felt amicably about the damages to be paid,” said Chief Commissioner Mădălin șaranu of the IPJ.
The Great Migrations
Russia is not and will not be prepared for what comes next.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and clearly: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalize represent, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the Romanian state’s ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants really agree to settle in our localities, the chances of integrating them quickly into Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I am sure they will be the first to lose their patience.
Paralyzed by interlopers and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the Gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent healthcare, collect dirt off the street, create honorably paid jobs, or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what produces much wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
First, we are confronted by the mischievous outpouring of powerful EU states, who are showing the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing their troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Probably for fear of stealing from any national entity.
In the end, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, while invoking only the horrors of war as the reason for their departure, accept no other destination of the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be laughed at.
Causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, relying strictly on the book of political correctness, demand peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even some foreign capital enters, from time to time, in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosed, divided and outdated construction.
We regretted that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but the EU does not have a future plan either.
Improvisations and threats don’t help.
Then, what good would the EU do if the only advantage Romanians enjoyed – the right to free movement – could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
In the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what comes next.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destinations are practically imposed.
The tender for the concession covers a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it remained closed, the club in the courtyard of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The building has a useful area of 134 sqm, on two levels of grass.
CJ accepts only those of a literary café, bookstore or other culturally relevant activities as destinations given to the building.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, with the start value of the auction being 6,830 euros annually, with a bidding step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to continuously and permanently operate the building and fully cover the costs of rehabilitation of the building, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
“The Pogor Club building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period in which the public food unit operated in these spaces and even after its evacuation there were no current repairs and maintenance works as are routinely necessary during the operation of a building,” the document states.
The club’s concession offers are expected until September 18.
Two of Tom's siblings swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds and 11-year-olds, respectively, from Tom and their siblings, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was on treatment, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were rushed to St. Mary’s Hospital in Iasi.
They are in stable condition, as doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20 he received a courageous gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in vague conditions, in the dark of the 90s, when she was only two months old, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years in which adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman comes out, now a blonde and beautiful girl, almost without birth.
Crina will be celebrating these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought of giving their beloved daughter a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iasi, to know her unclear past.
The Iași newspaper, which witnessed the family’s search after some extremely vague hints, has witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
Reporters’ stories, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the town of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital, at birth.
At home there were disagreements between the parents, and the mother had to leave the house.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I've known nothing.
“When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late,” recalls Alina, the girl’s biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and even then the girl’s father, Costică Balkan, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives would be permanently separated.
They never found Crina in the hospital.
After the internment, Crina’s father went to work in another town, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
“She would have thought she was abandoned,” a family granddaughter said.
Because of financial problems, Grandma could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was more interested in the fate of the child during all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, which then gave her to the Care Center of Placement in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love with the blonde and Crina, and after some time she would move permanently with them to Italy.
The children had already done almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I knew she was our girl.
“As if my wife had given him life,” Salvadore, the adoptive father, smiles as he grabs the girl’s weak hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina’s parents, Alina and Costică, continued searching separately, each as far as he could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but received no answer where his child might be.
The police then told her that she may have died, but in Iași the parents learned what really happened to their daughter.
When I searched here, they told me at the Tribunal that she was gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And conditions to look for it I never had.
We prayed to God to be well.
I thought about it in all the years that have passed, but it was not possible to walk, to find it.
“It’s hard,” she tells us with tears in her eyes, Crina’s biological mother.
But even though the years have passed, the patients of Ruginosaa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and her wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I guess I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
“I wanted to meet my parents in Romania,” says Crina excitedly.
And her dream was to become a reality.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Iasi, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained to him Salvadore’s desire to find Crina’s biological family.
The search started with just one name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We get only one name, Balkan Coast, then the town, Ruginosa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I was able to ask if there is by the locality the name received.
Then they gave me some indications, except that the person found was not the one they were looking for.
“It took us about a month to find the girl’s biological father,” said Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim.
In total, more than three months they took the authorities to find Costică and Alina, especially since each had their domicile in another locality.
We started somewhere in March, and in the months of June-July we completed the identification of biological patients and the discussions.
“Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September,” Ichim added.
Last weekend, Alina and Costică saw their lost daughter for the first time in the halls of the Iasi hospital 20 years ago.
The father, moved, could barely control his tears, and his hands trembled constantly.
He barely exchanged a few words with those around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't sleep much.
He was all excited, trembling.
“To see your baby after all these years, it’s something,” says a niece, who also comes with Costică de la Ruginosa.
Criana’s meeting with her biological mother and brother
In conversations with his daughter, who is going to study at a highly rated university in Italy, Costică Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wants to return to him, in the village, he can come quietly: he can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and buy a farm.
Her mother is excited, she is crying, and she hardly believes that this can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I’ve seen many cases on TV, I’ve been thinking for many years, I’ve hoped, but I didn’t think I could be like that.
They're really big emotions.
If you could forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
“I hope we can keep a bond,” says Alina, Crina’s mother, with tears on her cheeks as she holds a napkin tightly in her hand.
In him she hides her tears of happiness, because in a short time she will see her face after so bitter a time.
On the other side, Crina, who is only a few days away this month, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
I don’t know what to expect, but she sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
After all, my parents are the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
“I hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say,” Crina tells us.
The first family meeting in Iași
In the Square of the Union, under the sky of the beginning of autumn, the family of Ruginosa once again unites their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing high school, after the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costică, her biological parents.
They no longer divide borders or countries, but only one barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iași, they passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind made, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises again, they will do it again.
It’s the first event of its kind to be organized, such an emotional burden, and I’m glad it’s a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who consume, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to put something good back on society.
“If I am asked again for such an event, I will do it with great love,” says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counseling Iasi.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, walks away telling.
They understand: they have a lot to say to each other.
He was gunned down yesterday at the PSD.
Everybody pulls their soul.
The camps in the PSD branch have concluded a truce with the gun on their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party’s executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the left-wing social democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for party functions.
Far from being over, the party’s internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow the fighters to pull their souls.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He released a very simple and very current message in the conditions of now: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
On October 3rd, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
“Until then, we remain in the existing structure,” said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of talks over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing was certain.
In the October elections, fierce competition is expected for the position of chairman of the county branch of the PSD.
The short list of possible candidates for the main office of the party’s branch is Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazár, County Councilor Vasile Quantea and the interim president of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
The mayor of the town of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, could also be added to these.
A variant taken into account is also the candidacy of the leader of the county councilors of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, in case Lupu will no longer enroll in the race, sources within the party stating that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former head of the subsidiary, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day candidates can be submitted, and it would not surprise anyone if it happened.
“Importantly, we remain united, and we will remain united after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all new leadership structures,” she said.
Until the internal elections are organized, the management of the county branch of PSD will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu is on leave until September 29, the preparation of the elections being practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, County Councilor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by phone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions of the last days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
“But, on the other hand, there are several variations on the intentions related to the candidacy for the PSD Iasi presidency, the list remaining open,” Stanciu commented.
A judge refused the case of the rapists in Vaslui on the grounds of concubinage.
The six young men in Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Iasi Court of Appeal.
Vaslui sentenced to five to eight months to eight months and four months will present their arguments on their release today, after the court of law, the Vaslui Court, ordered their imprisonment immediately after the sentencing.
The case was registered at the Court of Appeals late last week, with magistrate Dan Anton filing an abstention request, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton alleged that one of the defendants, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the highest punishment in this file.
How Judges Sentenced
At the end of last week, the magistrate of the Vaslui Court who condemned the seven young men gave reasons for the sentence.
In the motivation, the judge speaks of the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, noting that such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among the public opinion.
“The court finds that after the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of the accused, their families and their local supporters, a strong sense of outrage was felt at the level of the local and national community about the fact that people accused of serious acts are less motivated by a restrictive measure.”
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be "church door".
"The court stresses that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, an aspect that the defendants wished to highlight through the defenses they have formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the Future of Europe
Because of economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past decades can no longer continue the same in the years to come.
By Saturday, few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of Britain’s Labour Party, many are wondering to what extent the election of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position can affect us.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist Labour leader since the war.
A declared Marxist, anti-monarchist (he once asked Tony Blair, then prime minister of the EU, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a ferocious anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and of the terrorist movements of the Great Britain and Hamas.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
Following the pattern of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what Tsipras was saying and promising in Greece until he came to terms with the real world and economic legacies.
The economic program of the new Labour leader includes, among other things, massive renaissances and the printing of money as a solution to finance development projects and to cover very generous social benefits.
Sure, some may wonder why the money printing solution is not unanimously adopted around the world, we would then have a global overall prosperity!, but who stops such details.
Of course, we can tax the bankers in blood, become some kind of enemies of the left, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterrand and Hollande.
The extra amounts are quickly swallowed up by the generous, coverless promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher put it, “The problem with socialism is that at some point someone else’s money runs out.”
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in beliefs as the party’s new leader, failed in the election.
And then there was still a relatively consistent and structured working class in Britain in the classical sense of the word.
And the unions were significantly more influential than they are now.
In the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant across the workforce and extensive automation has made the industry in massive need of highly skilled labor, Corbyn’s rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even in opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In his latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn’s election raises the chances of Brexit, namely Britain’s exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that is shaking from the foundations of the EU, you end up in an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide in the referendum, which is due to take place by 2017, to leave the Union for the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep faults created within it by the Euro crisis and now that is why refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
Even more so, for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin became increasingly the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates of the country’s stay in the EU.
Today’s world is no longer the one of the past.
There are many resentments, which are increasing in intensity even these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, which I had just recently sampled in Jean Clude Junker’s speech, is increasingly tending to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of member states in consultation with only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is happening as electoral support for anti-immigration, anti-immigration and Eurosceptic groups increases dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the negatively charged emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever in the past.
This is what the Financial Times is doing when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that starts from the international interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn’s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today’s politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we are witnessing a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the countries in the region to the periphery of interest and decision-making in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States fuels his populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
Because of economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both provoked by hasty decisions that have taken into account only the integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and readiness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turmoil on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can greatly affect Romania’s situation.
And it's hard to rule out anything from the standpoint of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncuși, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Cheese: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to be heard about him all over the world.
But behind its reputation lies something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories, recipes for them in life, are delivered to us.
That thing also has a name.
It's called "trude."
What do you write about Constantin Brancusi?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the banknotes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising video.
Cheese produces and delivers money almost 60 years after he is no longer with us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
Even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes outside with the child, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to Brâncuși".
The country is full of its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brâncuți's infiltration capacity is huge.
Even the Communists have not been able to extirpate it from the memory and culture of Romania.
Its quotes are now soaring on the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else could be said about this man?
Looked at from the pile of books and articles trying to reconstitute his destiny, Brâncuși’s life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you weren’t lucky enough to be born in some big city and in a family as wealthy as you are, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Brancusi's life is the perfect counter-example.
And maybe this is a key.
Maybe that’s where the next text should start.
With a sentence, no matter how hateful these are.
Forget the silly success stories, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on TV.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how to get to life, how, today, he heard a whole world map?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobiși, a small village in the commune of Peștișani, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncuși lived a modest life, but one of which would pick up the landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre Săușa in Paris in 1933: "At that time the life was beautiful and harmonious".
For thousands of years, people lived happily a patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from one season to the next.
Do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
However, the child’s childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor during the years spent in his native town.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuși was three years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the toucan was being made "in the cauldron", watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going well, Brâncuși catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills the head of his palms with touca and drinks on the breathless.
He falls into sleep almost instantly.
The first people noticed it only after a few minutes.
The mother panics, then enters hysteria, believing her son has died.
Towards the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by plowshares, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who await him with the soul in their mouths.
The party immediately turns into mourning.
The father is already thinking about the burial.
However, someone thinks it’s okay to call Baba Brândă, the Chestnut Maiden and Chestnut Maiden.
The handle checks the baby’s breathing, then puts the ponytail under his nose, gathered from around.
The child sneezes loudly.
The world applauds.
While the boy is left to sleep his drunkenness, the party with the plowmen continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the orchard.
Radu Brâncuși asks Constantine to gather some of the sticks and bring them to him.
The father lays his child with his head down and, with the bruises brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And as he senses the bruising of the blows, the little Cheeseman has the revelation that the world can be looked at from another perspective and that things around him can appear turned upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in old age, if not the astro himself participated in his disturbance.
Would the sun have been as disturbed as his father was by what had happened to him?
Currently, the city is not functioning.
A parliamentarian appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent deputy Viorel Blăjut called on the PSD and PNL to stop internal struggles and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great division, and that’s all.
I haven't seen any of the 2012 USL projects going on.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, you just see how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let’s put aside politics a little bit, get together and talk.
At present, the city is not functioning.
“If you’re busy with the internal war, you don’t have time for those who chose you,” Blăjut said.
He appreciated that the current political class disappointed the voter base, the consequence being a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around the figure of 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
He also believes that voters will also orient themselves to traditional parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break from the electorate of the right, not from that of the PSD.
Such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually right-wing.
“It’s shattering even more right, which is not good for anyone, not even for the PSD,” Blojut said.
He said he is not interested in a candidate in the upcoming local elections, denying rumors of his intention to enroll in the City Hall race.
I also said I don’t want to run for office.
I would like to continue as a member of Parliament in the future.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iasi and in the lobby discussions with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to image myself.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
“If people voted for us, it doesn’t mean they’re stupid to vote for us if they don’t see anything,” said Blăjut, who said the main reason the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the parents.
A colleague from Tătărați said that his money is not enough and he has to go by bus.
Let us not be hypocrites.
There is little money.
Sometimes I'm embarrassed to pick up money from the cashier.
At the end of the term, I will report on everything I have spent, apart from the salaries of the employees at the office and their maintenance.
I happened to pick up in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and other settlements.
“To tell a parliamentarian that he doesn’t get his money is pure hypocrisy,” Blăjut concluded.
