Austria’s right-wing populists triumph, they have 29 percent in total
Preliminary results show that the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 percent of the votes, the country's leading political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the vote, finished even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parties of the post-war period; especially for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Still at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
Now, the voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations were made about the possible resignation of the party leader and current Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the leadership of the party.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election that remains most likely, namely the renewal of the large coalition SPÖ and ÖVP.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties – the Free Party (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes – the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the People’s Party agreed with the populists (at the time the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ split from the common.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna on the national political scene, apparently bets on this evolution.
The last party to gain access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell, among the Austrian political parties, from third to fifth position.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four per cent limit and did not reach parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India likely to cool
If the problem of accused Czech researchers in India accused of illegal cockroach harvesting could not be resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, which followed a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, on leaving the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr Ivácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"Their problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for the three-year prison sentence would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could then seek bail and await trial on release, he said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises appealing to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," says the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided by India.
“We want above all to keep the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians recognize it as well,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told TK, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
“We regard the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great contempt,” he said.
The minister evaded the question of whether he got a promise from India to take care of the case.
“I’ve already received quite a few promises,” he said.
A Czech arbiter of the fight for the seabed
It approaches an electronic wall map, on which is represented Australia and adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the UN division for ocean affairs and the law of the sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
Work ardor and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little known world, rich in natural resources.
It includes oil, minerals and other mineral resources, as well as currently unknown living organisms, which may hold the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A wider ground than the dry land
The coastal states have begun to aspire vehemently to the new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they are using their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter can, according to the convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered a continental shelf.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone,” explains Mikulka.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf, must be supported by extensive scientific-technical documentation, based on many expensive prospections and expertise.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
“One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the committee has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
At the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently experienced a global repercussion.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission awarded it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, which is six times the extent of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The future benefits of seabed exploitation will be invaluable, as they plan to do.
Progressively, other countries will, in turn, submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
Here, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There is no longer a state with an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, let's not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka, adding that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime is anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other former Eastern bloc states in the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, it obtained the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is turbulent, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a concretization.
It is reminiscent of a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on site for the release of the hostages.
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are being revealed.
According to indications from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both specialists from the Federal Army and officials from GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk, were at the place of release.
As the ministry spokesman said on Monday evening, German forces were ultimately not required, as the hostage takers freed their prisoners and fled when they acknowledged the imminence of a forced release.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the assistance offered by Germany to integrate it on the spot as a support force.
“Fortunately, this has not happened so far,” said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had kidnapped in the south of Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained vague, as have details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have in the meantime arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given about the date of their return to Germany.
According to "Bild" magazine, the five vacationers and special forces are expected to have taken off aboard an Air Force Airbus and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has narrowly failed the $700 billion financial market bailout.
The Dow Jones was crumbling in the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s financial markets bailout.
Despite all the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians to head both parties, the program that was to curb the chaos of the financial markets did not win the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the partisans had desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-founded 700-billion-dollar plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on MPs to vote in favour even though the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones was down more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concern that the state bailout could overturn.
He came back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
For the program to come into force, approval and approval from the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
When it comes to bookings for the coming months, according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak cyclical prospects, Germans’ thirst for travel remains insatiable, according to this study.
When it comes to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded revenues of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as reported Monday in Berlin by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to the survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, growing numbers of bookings already dominate the autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent more compared to 2007, DRV said.
The sources of these results are figures from the GfK, which analyzes monthly booking data from 1,200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the US would be particularly in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about one-third.
Apart from that, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought after destinations by the Germans.
Specially organized trips are in high demand, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising prices of energy and food, the costs would here be "more easily computable for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offerings, Laepple said.
The summer months were also very successful so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, beer in liter pitchers and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is a blonde, television host and wears a custom-made tyrolian costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves at us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the equator of the Weißwurst, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Place Thérèse, everything is half as bad.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a tyrannical suit or leather pants; no one looks blazed or shamed - this is completely normal.
Only the apron in my Tyrolean costume gets a few weird eyebrows at the chocó banana stand.
A Bavarian remarked that I would have wrongly tied my apron: "on the left means free, in the middle virgin, on the right married, on the back widow."
Discreetly, I tripod my loop from the back to the left.
“It’s better,” she said and laughed.
Others don’t go as hard for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written “Too drunk to get dressed!” and exposes us to their naked backstage without being invited.
The exhibitionist young man's name is Bob, he comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He thinks it's "gorgeous," with an elongated "ooooo."
He tells me all about it after he got away from the drink he had before.
Right next to that fire pit that everyone thinks is a trash can.
Bob is one of those infamous "wild pissers."
Others aren’t lucky enough to be able to get rid of alcohol this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, rows of rescuers run to the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
This is how it works for most beer festival visitors: we go empty, we come back full of it.
Those who rest in the coffin of the stuffed under the tarpaulin are not visible.
“They’re the ones who can’t swallow anything anymore,” one of the rescuers yells at me in response to my question and then disappears into the melee.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in Friday's midday accident in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its backcountry.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with an observation tower at each of its corners, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt about the greatness of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, retarded by the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and Imperial forces advanced beyond Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a munitions-laden train exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points serves - at least symbolically, to underline the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeping car in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP AKP Turkish Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a journey of ten and a half hours, shaken on noisy tracks whose cadence reminded me of the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital – presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built in stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and by many pastry shops in which middle managers in suit-tie-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a center-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
“The aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for either.
She had to do both.
"But then at some point, I asked if Turkey shouldn't choose."
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone I was able to talk to told me by heart: The Turkish railroad is not only going to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another sleepless night, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could largely be in Turkey’s hands.
While waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been named "the sick man of Europe".
At least, there is no longer any doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the next year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include those under the age of 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us over the age of 20 refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music presented to it, be it Madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me -- and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley possessed such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, “only focus on certain people.”
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history, at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of hoplon-norma research, while doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
That's what comes from the letter from the Woodruff author in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at hop Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition " Flamenco and Life " because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second Assault on Honda Super Sales
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had good habitability, this new minivan has an even wider interior space.
In addition to this, there are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among them are innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before reviewing the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation came on the market.
First of all it is noted that Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
So, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it expects to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
Heads of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand’s managers hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 fewer than in 2007, i.e. a 16% drop in sales.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also expects to gain a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid of compact size – 4.37 meters long – on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of the Insight’s sales will be in the United States, while the other half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is expected in the first three months of next year, following its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change or 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space as well.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a gasoline reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capacity of the trunk – which has a double bottom system – can hold up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity compared to the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to the exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, part of the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2- and 1.4-litre gasoline thrusters.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This booster - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that prevents collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, this time Nissan was inspired by the nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by mimicking bee theft, prevents accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have made this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan safety shield.
This robot will allow the brand’s vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the bee's compound eyes, able to see from an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers developed a so-called laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurcating its wheels by 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Movement Laboratory and principal engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a function of rotation, but also of acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
"Every second this device only has to process information and act on this data.
It does not need to retain the information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first bus to develop new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced in production cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot runs on lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS navigation satellite system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury, besides having a lot of cash to make plans, is not devoid of geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn how not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say 'the hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Maître d'Hôtel leads us to think several times if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And most importantly, where to do it.
Of course, this game gives useful but not very detailed information.
It’s more of a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It’s better than nothing, since it’s unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry in its turn of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, which will pay $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp drop in its stock price.
A week after unveiling an interim deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley common stock at a unit price of $25.25, or a total amount of $3 billion.
The chosen price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, 28% above its current price.
Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s chief executive.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but puts it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained to Tokyo, “we thought that the stake would be entirely made up of ordinary shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into common shares in a year if they trade more than 50% above the conversion price, or about $47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a spokeswoman for the group declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" eased its balance sheet since late August.
The past few weeks have been challenging for the group, which has seen its stock market price melt by half as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt soared.
This cost fell on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Reshaping the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like its counterparts and friends, it was the third to vote on a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" scored 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted outside polling stations and a count from a non-governmental organization announced a broad “yes” victory, placing it between 63 and 70 percent.
Rafael Correa claimed on Sunday night the victory of his draft Constitution.
“The Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place calmly according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, focused on a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution consecrates state power over the economy, reserving it the “development planning” of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the draft also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who can serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad.
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who were captured 10 days ago.
They are in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive for 10 days in the desert were safely returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently fit, the hostages arrived at around 15:30 a.m. aboard a special aircraft at al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in “good health,” and “no ransom has been paid” to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the outskirts of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from one hideout to the other by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the safari agency Aegyptus.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of shots occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others were fleeing," said the official, who requested anonymity.
He said that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our secret service, special forces men," he said, without further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which were the kidnappers, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed they were linked to a rebel group from Darfur, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Good.
But one area of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the sums of misery that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that starve?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the Château de Chinon alone in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and this in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with three under private archive clusters and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, protesting with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When is a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalize Part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states help the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European bank in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, to the tune of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also having interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s head of competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has escalated in more than a year is for Fortis, and from a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy almost half (to the tune of 49%) of the bank’s capital located in each of the countries.
The bank will, without a doubt, sell part of its holdings, among which, in the first place, the mainly insurance activities, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organisation ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company’s shares fell 12 percent to their lowest level of 14 years ago.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company's executives, is not realistic.
The company's management accuses the uncertainty of overseas, in connection with the adoption of the US $700 billion bailout, of being at the root of the fall in Fortis stocks.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Earlier, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they will not lose their money.
No panics were felt in the bank’s customer circle and no agencies were stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become out of control.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information about the prescription of medicines, in all cases, with the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program has to be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like handing over your chicken coop to a fox,” Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told The Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the insured capital in case of damage, on the health of the client who presents, and if they believe the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after they had seen the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, it can easily be provided to pharmacies, data on the person's purchases of drugs in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, which disease the person suffers from and what his health is.
For example, if that person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, it refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is not much left to do to the insurer apart from paperwork. However, tiny problems can still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or against hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while others do not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of the data, and they must seek the authorization of the patient before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctioned for their shortcomings in the past.
In recent years, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them with data on drug consumption, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of usage is becoming more and more difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill to expand the circle of authorities’ control over companies specializing in providing data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
So, in the end, the chickens depend on the kindness of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The EU and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other problems, largely global.
Today, a France-India summit will also be held, where the main issue will be atomic energy cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is a major emerging democratic power that should be given a wider say in international affairs, but member countries have yet to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not spend too much time on this issue yesterday at this 9th summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would double trade, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be too ambitious a goal.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civilian flights, which will also allow air trade to take off in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with, on the one hand, India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and, on the other, New Delhi, which is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, along with all forms of terrorism, and there has been talk of the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on this issue.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle was also called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains true to the energy and climate agenda, including that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 percent until 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as with the fact that a global market should be reached at the climate conference scheduled for next year, and greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by fifty percent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is now visiting the French capital, where during a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the news agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers attended the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, during the ceremony of inauguration of the Italian Butterfly: in fact, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with an Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the meeting with the press in the Room Struktur, at the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books gradually decreases compared to the total Italian production, and in particular, compared to that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3,000 meters above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammown Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
“The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared,” Anderson said.
The sheriff said no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said a few hours after the wreck was located, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft as the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset’s personal belongings were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a pull.
Fossett's search was halted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
On his sixth attempt in 2002, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had travelled around the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among all these records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
An extraordinary 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
This is, in short, Glk, the last born of the off road "compact" of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Thanks to its extraordinary, unexpected and unconventional content, communication will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from 17 October.
Thus the hype that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication involves the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimension and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that when looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created any big problems.
He had never been involved with the opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups were added (not really) from Campania and Puglia.
They had tricolor flags on which their hometown appeared: on Saturday night, they were all abducted so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English typhoid.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhoon of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had in fact controlled them all: of those who went to Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the coming acts of the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it may be that the fans arrested or identified in the disorder are purging a Daspo for at least five years .
An international Daspo that prohibits the attendance of Italian stadiums, but also European ones.
In short, our hooligans will no longer step into the stadium.
Luckily.
But now is the time of fear-emulation: that is, others are likely to add to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must put this fire out immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's national team game in Lecce"
In Apulia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say, the secret services, which deal precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched out during the Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste, where a core group of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, praising Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had stayed within the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistle to the anthem of Mameli: these too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not polite...”
